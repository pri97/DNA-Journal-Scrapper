IntroductionGummy stem blight (Gsb) is a destructive disease caused by the ascomycetous fungus Didymella bryoniae (Auersw.) Rehm, which can infect many cucurbit species.1 Because of the agricultural importance of this disease, cucurbit sources of genetic resistance were selected several decades ago.2 Gsb of melon has increased in importance because it is responsible for considerable economic losses, especially in humid tropical and sub-tropical regions. Many Gsb-resistant melon varieties have been identified, and genetic analyses revealed several independent Gsb-resistance loci, including five monogenic dominant resistance loci (Gsb-1, Gsb-2, Gsb-3, Gsb-4, and Gsb-6) and one monogenic recessive resistance locus (gsb-5) from six resistant PIs (PI140471, PI157082, PI511890, PI482398, PI420145, and PI482399), respectively.3,4 Different molecular markers linked to Gsb resistance have been used for marker-assisted selection of Gsb-resistant germplasms.5 However, a functional Gsb-resistance gene has not been identified.Several genetic linkage maps from different populations have been constructed based on relatively few molecular markers, which were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for agronomic and disease-resistance traits in melon.6–9 After the whole melon (Cucumis melo) genome sequence was published,10 those available simple sequence repeat and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were integrated to build preferably genetic maps useful for anchoring contigs/scaffolds or locating QTLs.11 High-throughput re-sequencing has been proposed as a viable option for detecting markers, genotyping and constructing genetic maps.12 It has been used to construct ultra-dense genetic maps based on the availability of advanced recombinant inbred lines or an F2 population.13–16 Many important QTLs or genes have been identified using mapping-by-sequencing methods, which have accelerated forward-genetics research even in non-model species.17,18During the co-evolution of plants and microbes, host-adapted pathogens evolved effectors to suppress pathogen-associated molecular patterns-triggered immunity (PTI), which is the first basal defence against infections by non-adapted pathogens. Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) conferred by plant resistance (R) genes contributes to a highly effective defence system, which is deployed by plants as a second, largely intracellular, layer of immunity.19–22 A coordinated relay of information between the cytoplasm and nucleus by intracellular signalling systems is required for both PTI and ETI to ensure defence-related transcripts are transferred from nucleus to the cytoplasmic protein synthesis machinery.In this study, we constructed an ultra-dense genetic map with 12,932 recombination bin markers comprising 1,188,159 SNPs. This map may be useful for updating the melon genome and for mapping C. melo genes. For example, we mapped a 108-kb region associated with Gsb resistance on pseudo-chromosome 4. This ultra-dense genetic map may be useful for future molecular analyses of melon.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and Didymella bryoniae inoculationAn inbred line of Cucumis melo spp. conomon (var. conomon) (HS) and an inbred line of Cucumis melo spp. melo (var. inodorus) (XH) were crossed to generate F1, F2, and BC1 populations. The HS and XH lines as well as their F1, F2, and BC1 populations were used for genetic analyses. The F2 population was used to construct a genetic map and map the candidate Gsb-resistance gene.Plants were inoculated with D. bryoniae using a modified version of a published method.23 The D. bryoniae spores collected from infected melon plants were cultured on potato dextrose agar medium in Petri dishes using a mycelial plug inoculation. The Petri dishes were incubated at 25 °C in the darkness for 7 days and then under ultraviolet irradiation conditions (40 w, 12 h light/12 h dark) for 4 days. Inocula were prepared by flooding the Petri dishes with 5–10 ml acidified distilled water. The resulting solution was acidified to pH 4.0 using lactic acid, and Tween-20 was added as a surfactant (20 drops/l). The spore suspension was adjusted to 5 × 105 spores/ml using a haemocytometer, and then applied to 3- to 4-week-old plants in a foliar spray. Inoculated plants were covered by a plastic tent to maintain a relative humidity of 92%. The plastic wrap was removed 3 days later. Plants were re-inoculated to ensure there were no escapees or false-positives.2.2. Sequencing library construction and high-throughput sequencingGenomic DNAs was extracted from the leaves of the parental lines (HS and XH) and 150 individual lines from the F2 population according to the CTAB method. The genomic DNAs were sheared into ~500-bp fragments using the S2/E210 Ultrasonicator (Covaris, USA) for the subsequent paired-end (PE125) sequencing using the HiSeq2500 system (Illunima, USA).2.3. SNP identification and genotypingRaw reads were filtered to generate clean reads, which were mapped to the genome to estimate the insert sizes in the sequencing library, calculate the reads depth, and determine the distribution of reads in the melon genome (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000313045.1/ (23 August 2017, date last accessed))10 using the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner programme.24 Duplicated reads were removed using SAMtools.25 Potential SNPs between all lines and the genome were detected using the GATK toolkit.26 The SNPs identified between the parents were considered as polymorphic for a subsequent bin calling. The F2 genotypes were identified based on the SNP positions. The ‘pileup’ function of the SAMtools programme was used to merge the SNP datasets, in which only biallelic SNPs were kept. Short reads that were matched to multiple locations in either genome, or that did not match perfectly with at least one of the parental genomes were discarded. The VCF format document was used for genotyping according to the parental SNPs, and only the aa × bb genotype was kept. The SNPs with less than 4× coverage in either parent or with fewer than 15 SNPs in a single scaffold were eliminated. Additionally, the SNPs with an extreme segregation distortion (P < 0.01) were initially excluded by the <U+03C7>2 test for a subsequent bin calling. 2.4. Bin map and linkage map constructionA modified slide window method was adopted for bin calling.13 The genotype of each window was called with a window size of 15 SNPs and a step size of 1 SNP. Windows containing more than 13 ‘aa’ or ‘bb’ types were genotyped as ‘aa’ or ‘bb’, respectively. Fifteen adjacent SNP intervals with the same genotype across the entire F2 population were combined into a recombination bin. A final set of bin markers was used to construct linkage groups (LGs) with the HighMap programme.27 Marker loci were partitioned primarily into LGs based on their locations in the C. melo genome. Next, the modified logarithm of odds (MLOD) scores between markers were calculated to verify the robustness of the markers in each LG. Markers with MLOD scores <5 were filtered prior to ordering. The error correction strategy of SMOOTH was then used according to the parental contributions to genotypes, and a k-nearest neighbour algorithm was applied to impute missing genotypes. Skewed markers were then added into the map by applying a multipoint maximum likelihood mapping. Map distances were estimated using the Kosambi mapping function. We then used the ALLMAPS programme to construct melon pseudo-chromosomes based on a comparison between the constructed genetic map and the map of the melon genome.28 Finally, we constructed pseudo-chromosomes referred to the published genome of melon.2.5. Analysis of co-linearity and recombination hotspotsThe sequences of the bin markers included in the linkage map were aligned to the physical sequences of C. lanatus (ftp://www.icugi.org/pub/genome/watermelon/97103/v1/ (23 August 2017, date last accessed)) and C. sativus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/1639?genome_assembly_id=228904 (23 August 2017, date last accessed)) using the BLAT programme to confirm their physical positions in the genome. Spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the co-linearity between C. melo and C. lanatus, and between C. melo and C. sativus. Recombination hotspots (RHs) were predicted based on the recombination rate of markers and the anchored C. melo genome. If the value that the genetic distance between adjacent markers was divided by a value >20 cM/Mb, the region between the two adjacent markers was considered to be an RH.292.6. Re-anchoring scaffoldsFiltered markers were mapped to genome assembly scaffolds, and the markers on scaffolds that were mapped to pseudo-chromosomes were counted. If the value of the following equation was >0.5, we kept the scaffold mapping results, otherwise, they were eliminated: [number of markers in the largest pseudo-chromosome - number of markers in the second largest pseudo-chromosome]/number of markers in the largest pseudo-chromosome. We then determined the position of each marker relative to each other. If the relative position in the scaffold was identical to the relative position in the genetic map, the scaffold was considered to be oriented in the forward direction. Additionally, if more markers were in the forward position than in the reverse position, the scaffold was considered to be facing the forward direction. Finally, we selected one clearly oriented scaffold as the initial scaffold, and iteratively anchored other scaffolds with higher scores.2.7. Mapping of candidate Gsb-resistance genesThe rQTL package was used to map the candidate Gsb-resistance genes. The IM method of the rQTL package was applied for qualitative trait mapping.30 The significance thresholds were determined using 1,000 permutations, in which the threshold value was set as 2.5. The hk algorithm was selected as the me parameter, while 1 and 3 were used as the win and cofactor parameters, respectively.2.8. RNA isolation, cDNA preparation, and quantitative real-time PCRLeaves from HS and XH plants after inoculation (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 days) were sampled and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated from leaves using mirVanaTM miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration and quality were assessed using a Thermo 2000 Bioanalyzer with an RNA NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific, USA; http://www.thermo.com (23 August 2017, date last accessed)). Samples showing A260/A230 ratio of 2.0–2.2 and A260/A280 ratio of 1.8–2.0 were used for further analysis. For quantitative real-time PCR, 1 µg of total RNA was reverse transcribed to first-strand cDNA in a final reaction volume of 20 µl using miScript II RT Kit (Qiagen). The transcriptional patterns of the candidate Gsb-resistance genes were analysed using a quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Details regarding the primers used in this study are provided in Supplementary Table S10.2.9. Genotyping analysis of MELO03C012987 geneFull-length sequence of MELO03C012987 gene (except for stop codon) was amplified by PCR from leaves of six resistant inbred lines (HP9818, HB6, HB11, HB13, CNZ, and QDH) and five susceptible inbred lines (RM, MW, DZX, M14086, and M15019) to analyse the SNP further. The primers are listed in Supplementary Table S10. The resulting PCR products were cloned into a pEASY-Blunt Zero Cloning Vector according to the manufacturer’s instructions (TRANs, Beijing, China; www.transgen.com.cn (23 August 2017, date last accessed)) and amplified in E coil overnight. Subsequently, eight clones of each line were sequenced by ABI3730xl sequencer. Few clones with sequence that did not match perfectly with reference full length were discarded.3. Results3.1. Gsb resistance in C. melo is controlled by a single dominant geneThe HS and XH inbred lines were used to construct a genetic map and evaluate Gsb resistance (Fig. 1A). Plants growth and the development of disease symptoms in seedlings inoculated with D. bryoniae were used to assess Gsb resistance or susceptibility. Accordingly, the HS and XH inbred lines were resistant and susceptible to Gsb, respectively (Fig. 1B and Table 1). A phenotypic analysis revealed that the F1 population from the XH × HS cross was resistant to Gsb, which is suggestive of a dominant resistance trait (Fig. 1A and Table 1). A phenotypic analysis of the F2 population derived from the XH × HS reciprocal cross revealed a 1:3 segregation ratio for the F2 population and a 1:1 segregation ratio for the BC1 population, which is consistent with a monogenic resistance trait (Table 1). Inheritance of Gsb resistance in C. meloPhenotypic observations for the whole plant 21 days post-inoculation were used to determine resistance/susceptible to Gsb.Observed segregation ratios are statistically consistent with the expected ratios (<U+03C7>2 test, P < 0.05).Inheritance of Gsb resistance in C. meloPhenotypic observations for the whole plant 21 days post-inoculation were used to determine resistance/susceptible to Gsb.Observed segregation ratios are statistically consistent with the expected ratios (<U+03C7>2 test, P < 0.05).Phenotypic analysis of the two inbred lines used to construct a genetic map and for mapping the Gsb-resistance gene.

Construction of a sequence-based ultra-dense C. melo genetic mapIn total, 12.94 and 13.14 Gb clean reads were generated for the XH and HS inbred lines (26× genome coverage), respectively. Meanwhile, 217.7 Gb clean reads were generated for the 150 F2 population individuals (2× genome coverage), with more than 85% of the bases higher than Q30 (Supplementary Table S1). The well-distributed clean reads coverage on assembly scaffolds as well as the distribution of SNP mutation and SNP quality were indicative of the stochastic nature of resequencing (Supplementary Table S1 and Figs S1 and S2). The co-segregating SNPs were clustered in recombination bins (marked as Block), which were used to construct genetic linkage map. We constructed an ultra-dense genetic map consisting of 12 pseudo-chromosomes based on 12,932 recombination bin markers comprising 1,188,159 C. melo SNPs (Supplementary File S1), which covered 1,818 cM, with an average distance of 0.17 cM between adjacent bin markers (Table 2, Supplementary Table S3). Construction of an ultra-dense C. melo genetic mapConstruction of an ultra-dense C. melo genetic mapHaplotype maps and linkage relationships heat maps were used to evaluate the quality of the genetic map. Haplotype maps, which indicate genotyping errors, were generated for each of the 150 lines in the F2 population as well as the parental lines. These maps presented the recombination events (pseudo-chromosome 10 haplotype map in Supplementary Fig. S3 and all haplotype maps for the 12 pseudo-chromosomes in Supplementary File S2). Almost all the recombination blocks were completely defined, with only pseudo-chromosome 7 missing 0.01% of its data. The linkage relationships heat maps, reflected the relationship between recombination markers in one pseudo-chromosome, and were used for ordering errors. These maps were created based on pair-wise recombination values for the 12,932 bin markers (pseudo-chromosome 10 linkage relationship heat map in Supplementary Fig. S4 and all linkage relationship heat maps for the 12 pseudo-chromosomes in Supplementary File S3). The constructed pseudo-chromosomes generally performed well according to the generated the heat maps. We then compared our genetic map (HS × XH) with a published melon genetic map (PS × SC).31 Of the 580 SNPs in the PS × SC F2 genetic map, 558 were mapped to the HS × XH F2 genetic map. Most of the pseudo-chromosomes were consistent with co-linearity (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S5). We likewise compared the HS × XH F2 genetic map with the melon genetic map compiled by the International Cucurbit Genomics Initiative.6 This comparison uncovered similar co-linear relationships among pseudo-chromosomes.

Genome re-anchoringThe HS × XH F2 genetic map was used to re-anchor the genome scaffolds to the 12 pseudo-chromosomes. We obtained all assembled scaffolds from the melon reference genome.10 Based on the genetic map, we anchored 92% of the scaffolds assembly (344.9 Mb of 374.8 Mb; 153 scaffolds) onto the 12 pseudo-chromosomes (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S4). We determined the orientation of 97.75% (336 Mb) of the anchored scaffolds, and detected chimeric scaffolds, with each anchored to different pseudo-chromosomes in the genome. For example, in scaffold NW_007546289.1, 264 Blocks were mapped onto pseudo-chromosome 5, and 72 Blocks were anchored onto pseudo-chromosome 8. In addition, in scaffold NW_007546312.1, 79 Blocks were mapped to pseudo-chromosome 8, and 41 Blocks were anchored to pseudo-chromosome 11. These results indicate that this ultra-dense genetic map may be used to improve the published melon genome assembly.

Scaffolds were displayed in blue and grey lines represent corresponding genetic markers between each pseudo-chromosome and scaffolds.3.4. Analysis of RHsWe identified 1,135 RHs, which were unequally distributed to all 12 pseudo-chromosomes. pseudo-chromosome 9 had the most RHs (153), while pseudo-chromosome 10 had the fewest (30) (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S5). Most RHs were located at the telomeres of pseudo-chromosome, which suggested the pericentromeric regions lacked recombination events (Fig. 4). The fact that almost no RHs were detected on one arm of pseudo-chromosome 10, may have been because very few markers were distributed in this region (Fig. 4), or might be related to the acrocentric morphology of this chromosome.31Genetic positions of the recombination hotspots in the 12 melon pseudo-chromosome.Genetic positions of the recombination hotspots in the 12 melon pseudo-chromosome.3.5. Comparison of the Cucurbitaceae pseudo-chromosomesA comparison between our genetic map of melon and the genetic maps of other Cucurbitaceae species (i.e., watermelon and cucumber) revealed a relatively weak syntenic relationship between the genomes (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. S6 and Table S6). In a comparison with cucumber chromosomes, Spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficients for 12 melon pseudo-chromosomes varied from 0.63 to 0.07. Additionally, in a comparison with watermelon chromosomes, Spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficients for 12 melon pseudo-chromosomes ranged from 0.67 to 0.01 (Supplementary Table S6). Of the 12 melon pseudo-chromosomes, pseudo-chromosome 10 exhibited a closer syntenic relationship with watermelon Chr 5 and cucumber Chr 5 than the other pseudo-chromosomes (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S6). These results imply that the genomic structures of pseudo-chromosome 10 from melon, Chr 5 from watermelon and cucumber are relatively conserved.

Mapping of C. melo Gsb-resistance gene candidatesThe 12 pseudo-chromosomes as well as the genotyping and phenotyping data related to Gsb resistance were used to map the candidate Gsb-resistance gene (GsbR). We identified a 0.667-cM region on pseudo-chromosome 4 with two bin markers (Block13188 and Block13179) that satisfied the LOD threshold of 2.5, implying the region is linked to Gsb resistance. The LOD values of Block13188 and Block13179 were 2.528 and 2.737, respectively, while the contribution rates were 9.36 and 10.72, respectively (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Table S7). The additive effects and dominant effects were 0.177 and 0.12, respectively (Supplementary Table S7). Furthermore, a scaffold (CM3.5_scaffold00018) with 71 well-distributed SNPs was identified during the genotyping of the HS (Gsb resistant) and XH (Gsb susceptible) parent lines (Supplementary Table S8). Eight candidate genes were annotated in this region based on the melon reference genome, GO, NR, Swiss-Prot, COG, and KEGG databases (Fig. 6A, Table 3, and Supplementary Table S9).

(E) Genotyping of the non-synonymous substitution of MEL03C012987 in resistant and susceptible lines of C. melo.We analysed the expression patterns of these candidate genes in HS and XH plants inoculated with D. bryoniae. We were unable to detect the expression of MELO3C012988, MELO3C012989, and MELO3C012990 in control and inoculated plants, implying these genes may not directly influence Gsb-resistance. In contrast, MELO03C012987 expression was considerably upregulated in HS and XH plants inoculated with D. bryoniae (Fig. 6B). The expression levels of the remaining candidate genes (i.e., MELO3C012986, MELO3C012991, MELO3C012992, and MELO3C012993) were not induced by D. bryoniae inoculation (Fig. 6B). These results indicated that MELO03C012987 is most likely the gene responsible for Gsb-resistance in melon. A Pfam BLAST analysis indicated that MELO03C012987 includes a DUF761 domain (Fig. 6C). We then compared the mapped region between the HS and XH lines. A non-synonymous SNP was identified in the MELO03C012987 gene, which resulted in a Lysine being replaced by a glutamic acid in the encoded protein (Fig. 6D). Genotyping MELO03C012987 from six resistant and five susceptible inbred lines of C. melo revealed that all five susceptible lines (RM, MW, DZX, M14086, and M15019) exhibited Adenine at the non-synonymous SNP, which is same as that found in XH plant. Of the six resistant lines genotyped, five (HB6, HB11, HB13, CNZ, and QDH) had the Guanine at this non-synonymous substitution as that in HS plant. Whereas, HP9818 exhibited either Guanine or Adenine, representing a heterozygous genotype (Fig. 6E and Supplementary Table S11).4. DiscussionThe melon genome sequence10 and several genetic maps7,8,11,31 have recently been published. However, functional genomics studies involving melon are still restricted by the fact only a few hundred or thousand markers have been explored. Based on a F2 population of double-haploid DHL92 used for melon genome sequence,10 a genetic map was developed composing of 580 SNPs, which anchored the scaffolds into a chromosome-scale pseudomolecules.31 This work not only provided a significantly updated melon genome, but also indicated that high-resolution genetic map could be an efficient approach for the improvement of genome draft sequence. Rapid advances in high-throughput sequencing have revolutionized SNP marker discovery and genotyping analyses. Additionally, high-throughput sequencing-based approaches are now routinely used to construct genetic maps.13,15,16 An important strength of genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is that the detection and genotyping of genome-wide SNP markers occur simultaneously. Moreover, a GBS approach does not require a reference genome for SNP calling and genotyping. However, an available reference genome is useful because it enables the proper alignment and ordering of sequenced tags and helps to impute low-coverage data.32 These two sub-species are commonly used in breeding programmes because they are resistant to multiple diseases and exhibit desirable traits regarding sugar content and flavour. After a genotyping analysis, we obtained 12,932 bin markers, which included more than one million SNPs. Using these bin markers, we constructed the first ultra-dense genetic map that can be used as a reference in future studies of melon. Recently, 354.98 Mb of melon scaffolds were anchored and 325.4 Mb of sequences were oriented by a new set of targeted SNP markers with better distribution in the parents of the DHL92 melon reference genome.31 In our study, several missed scaffolds were assembled into melon pseudo-chromosome. Furthermore, more sequence (336.05 Mb) were oriented in our new scaffold genome, suggesting that our ultra-dense genetic map could further improve the anchoring and orienting of melon scaffold genome assembly.A GBS-based high-resolution genetic map can be efficiently used to identify genetic regions and candidate genes underlying agronomically important traits.17,33,34 We mapped a 0.667 cM region on pseudo-chromosome 4, and identified eight candidate genes for Gsb resistance in this region. Thus, an ultra-dense genetic map can be constructed and candidate genes underlying Gsb resistance can be mapped using a GBS approach. Genetic map-based high-quality reference genome sequences provide useful information not only for identifying genes and regulatory elements, but also for characterizing genomic diversity.35 Our ultra-dense genetic map improved the re-anchoring of scaffolds to the reference genome. It may also contribute fundamental information for the de novo assembly of a high-quality oriental melon genome. Moreover, the improved anchoring of scaffolds may help researchers analyse chromosomal structures to improve the accuracy of gene mapping. Comparisons of genetic maps can reveal the genetic basis for conserved and variable sequences within species or among related species. We observed a strong co-linearity, but also rearrangements between our HS × XH F2 genetic map and the genetic maps of whole-genome sequenced melons, especially in pseudo-chromosomes 3–5. A chromosome-level comparison between the C. melo genetic map and the C. sativus and C. lanatus genomes revealed syntenic relationships among these three Cucurbitaceae species. The complex syntenic patterns presented as segmented chromosome-to-chromosome orthologous relationships were consistent with the notion that the chromosomal evolution and rearrangement among these three Cucurbitaceae species is very complex.10,36,37 However, it remains possible that such differences are derived from different mapping populations being used for various genotypes associated with a chromosome-level reorganization.Among the detected Gsb-resistance candidate genes, MELO3C012986 encodes a protein similar to a VHS domain-containing protein, which is involved in clathrin-related endomembrane trafficking in plants.38,MELO3C012991 encodes a Sec13, which is part of a nuclear pore complex with subunits that are involved in the responses to pathogens, cold stress, auxin, and ethylene.39 We identified an RT-like gene (i.e., encoding a reverse transcriptase) upstream of Sec13. An RT gene is usually associated with a mobile element, such as a retrotransposon, retrovirus, group II intron, retron, or retroplasmid, as well as an occasional retro (pseudo) gene.40–42,MELO3C012992 encodes a GATA zinc finger transcription factor family gene (GATA TF4-like), which has been implicated in light-responsive, circadian-regulated, and nitrate-dependent control of transcription.43,44Plants are often attacked by pathogens and have evolved a multi-layered defence system. An essential defence mechanism involves the expression of resistance (R) genes, which enables plants to detect pathogens carrying the corresponding avirulence (Avr) genes.21 The R protein-mediated pathogen recognition can be direct or indirect via the action of effectors (Avr proteins) on host targets. The R gene-based resistance is usually considered to be related to gene-for-gene resistance, which often involves a hypersensitive response (HR). MELO3C012987 encodes a protein that is similar to the uncharacterized Avr9/Cf-9 rapidly elicited (ACRE) protein 146, which is related to the gene-for-gene dominant resistance to fungal pathogens.45,46 Many ACRE genes encode putative signalling components, suggesting they are essential for early defence responses.45 Four genes (i.e., ACRE74, ACRE189, ACRE264, and ACRE276) have been confirmed as essential for both Cf-9- and Cf-4-mediated HR. Previous studies determined that ACRE74, ACRE264, and ACRE276 are critical for the Cf-9-mediated resistance to C. fulvum.47–49 Our data suggested that MELO3C012987, which encodes a protein similar to ACRE146, might be the Gsb-resistance gene in melon.In conclusion, our ultra-dense genetic map may be useful for future studies aimed at identifying the genes regulating agronomically important melon traits. Additionally, functionally characterizing MELO3C012987 may contribute to the development of new strategies to control Gsb in Cucurbitaceae species. However, gene-based disease resistance sometimes fails because of developmental and/or environmental changes. Incorporating Gsb resistance into field-grown crops will require the development of sustainable broad-spectrum disease resistance.AvailabilityThe re-sequence data can be available at NCBI under accessions SRP114921.We would like to thank Prof Fengming Song from Institute of Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, to offer the Gsb isolate.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.FundingThis study was supported by grants from the earmarked fund for Modern Agro-Industry Technology Research System of China (CARS-26-17), the Science and Technology Program of Zhejiang Province (2017C32041), and the Breeding Alliance of Rice and Major Economic Crops of Zhejiang University.Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary data"

IntroductionHigh-throughput sequencing has dramatically accelerated the pace of genomic research.1,2 While once restricted to model species in laboratory settings, genomic methods are being widely applied to non-model species in nature,3–8 rapidly illuminating the black box of the genome and giving rise to the field of ecological genomics.9–11 Reduced sequencing costs have made it feasible to study transcriptomes of co-occurring species in a community ecology context (i.e. ‘community transcriptomics’),12 as well as comparative studies of transcriptome evolution across diverse clades (i.e. ‘comparative transcriptomics’).13–16 While genomic data from model species can be informative for the biology of related organisms, not all species are the same in terms of their ecology, genetics, and morphology. For example, research on the zebrafish (Danio rerio, family Cyprinidae) can be relevant for closely related species, but cannot explain the tremendous ecological and morphological diversity in this clade, as studies of single species are insufficient for understanding dynamic interactions among species and their respective genomes in a macroevolutionary context. In order to understand the causes and consequences of those interactions, as well as the origin of ecological novelty (e.g. new genes17), we must examine genomes across species that reflect that diversity. Recent studies across a diverse suite of teleost fish lineages have focused on functionally-important genetic variation in non-model species in nature.18–22Transcriptomics of species in the wild has enormous potential to advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying molecular adaptation, evolutionary diversification, ecotoxicology, and community ecology.4,23–26 In this context, several important questions arise. For example, What are the proximate and ultimate mechanisms underlying phylogenetic, ecological, and morphological divergence? How have ancestral genomes been molded by divergent natural selection and other evolutionary forces into myriad forms that exist today? How does genomic architecture constrain or promote diversification? How important are genome duplication events in adaptive radiations? What role do genomes play in underlying the ecological dynamics of community assembly (e.g. competition, abundance, spatial and temporal dynamics, physiological constraint, etc.)? A necessary first step in addressing these questions is the generation of databases reflecting the genomic or transcriptomic variation among species, which we provide in the current study.Here we present transcriptomic resources for three members of the freshwater fish family Cyprinidae (Teleostei: Cypriniformes), one of the most speciose vertebrate clades, with over 2,000 species.27 In addition to remarkable species diversity, the clade includes extensive ecological, genetic, and morphological diversity. Cyprinid fishes (minnows and carp) comprise an important component of freshwater fish communities throughout North America, Asia, Europe and Africa.28 They are often the dominant fish taxa in numerical abundance and biomass and play an important functional role in aquatic ecosystems.29–31The ecological and taxonomic diversity of cyprinids is particularly interesting in light of the history of genome evolution in this clade. Cyprinids were part of the radiation that occurred after the teleost-specific genome duplication event, known as the ‘3R hypothesis’,32,33 that preceded and perhaps facilitated the diversification of teleost fishes.34 In addition, several cyprinid lineages have independently undergone additional rounds of genome duplications.35–38 For example, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) lineage had a fourth round of genome duplication approximately 5.6–11.339 or 8.240 million years ago (Ma), which we refer to as ‘Cc4R’. Pairs of genes arising from whole genome duplication, referred to as ‘Ohnologs’, were theoretically present for all genes immediately following the Cc4R genome duplication. Varying levels of subsequent gene-silencing and ‘re-diploidization’ have since occurred in polyploid lineages making cyprinids ideal for comparative studies of genome evolution.41,42Despite the ecological importance of cyprinids in freshwater systems worldwide and dynamic lineage-specific patterns of genomic expansions and contractions, most species have little or no genomic resources available for investigating their molecular ecology or genome evolution. Three notable exceptions are zebrafish (Danio rerio), fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), and common carp (Cyprinus carpio). The family includes zebrafish (Danio rerio),43–45 a model species with a comprehensively-annotated genome.46 Zebrafish is an important model organism in developmental biology and disease research,43–45 due to its semitransparent embryos and ease of laboratory culture, as well as its comprehensively annotated genome.46 Fathead minnow is widely used as an indicator species in ecotoxicology studies for which microarrays have been developed47,48 and a draft genome sequence is now available.49 Common carp is an important food fish, especially in Asia, and is produced extensively in aquaculture.50 The carp transcriptome has been studied elsewhere39,51,52 and recently a draft genome sequence was published.40We used the extensive zebrafish genomic resources available to annotate transcriptomes of three evolutionarily related, but non-model species that co-occur in parts of the west-central United States: Cyprinella lutrensis (red shiner), Platygobio gracilis (flathead chub) and Cyprinus carpio (common carp). These species were selected to reflect phylogenetic breadth, but also because their distributions overlap and occupy identical dryland river habitats (i.e. the Rio Grande, New Mexico), where they are exposed to similar biotic and abiotic conditions. Cyprinus carpio is native to Asia and Europe, but was introduced into North America, perhaps as early as 1831,53 and enthusiastically stocked throughout the US thereafter as a food fish, including New Mexico as early as 1889.54,Cyprinella lutrensis and Platygobio gracilis are both native to central and western North America, from the Mississippi River basin to the Rio Grande in New Mexico. Both C. lutrensis and C. carpio are highly tolerant of a wide range of environmental conditions and are highly invasive in areas outside of their natural range,55,56 whereas Platygobio gracilis is sensitive to environmental disturbance and imperiled or declining in several parts of its range.57Transcriptomes of Cyprinella lutrensis and Platygobio gracilis have not been published to our knowledge, whereas genomic and transcriptomic data are available for Cyprinus carpio.39,40,51,Cyprinella lutrensis and Platygobio gracilis are diploid (2n = 50), while Cyprinus carpio is allotetraploid 2n = 100,37 with some duplicated genes silenced after a lineage-specific whole genome duplication (i.e. Cc4R). Our aims in this study were to: (i) succinctly summarize and compare genes and functional annotation information obtained from various databases; (ii) test whether Cyprinus carpio expresses additional copies of particular genes compared to the two diploid species (Cyprinella lutrensis and Platygobio gracilis); (iii) identify potentially novel genes present in the three cyprinids that may underlie their unique ecological and morphological novelty and (iv) to assess evolutionary conservation of essential genes for development.In zebrafish, 307 genes are known to be essential for development. Knockout mutations in these genes are embryonic lethal according to experiments by Amsterdam et al.58 with subsequent revisions by Chen et al.59 and updates to the ENSEMBL database.60 These genes are highly conserved across extremely deep phylogenetic splits (e.g. yeast, fly, zebrafish, and human) due to their essential roles in development.58 Despite their importance, essential genes have not been studied in the context of comparative molecular ecology or ecological genomics of co-occurring species. Using transcriptome data presented in this study, we assessed the evolutionary conservation of the 307 zebrafish essential genes across four cyprinid lineages. We predicted that these genes would be highly conserved across all species, consistent with their critical functional roles, as compared to non-essential genes.61 If this is the case, then differences among species should be found in non-essential genes, such as lineage- or species-specific genes. We also tested whether both copies of duplicated genes in C. carpio (i.e. Cc4R Ohnologs) were retained and expressed in duplicate or whether one copy was evolutionarily lost.38,42 One mechanism for the loss of Ohnologs is ‘pseudogenization’,62 wherein a gene accumulates one or more internal stop codons that prevent formation of a functional protein product and thus becomes a pseudogene.63 If having redundant copies of essential genes were important for survival (e.g. due to loss-of-function mutations in one copy), then evolutionary retention of duplicates would likely be favored in C. carpio. Conversely, if regulation of proper gene expression levels were important in the context of functional pathways, then duplicated essential genes would likely be silenced at roughly the same rate as non-essential genes (although regulatory changes could also fine-tune expression patterns). We tested these hypotheses using expression data for the three cyprinid transcriptomes as compared to zebrafish. These sequences will provide resources for more detailed studies of the evolution and functional constraint of these critical genes, particularly in the context of genome expansions and reductions.2. Materials and methodsFish (n = 3 per species) were collected with a seine on 6 July 2012 from a field site on the Rio Grande, approximately 40 km south of Socorro, New Mexico (33.690556°N, 106.993042°W). Whole fish samples (juveniles or non-spawning adults) were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and transported to the laboratory. Skin, gill, gut, and kidney tissues were dissected and removed from frozen fish (outer layers were only slightly thawed by the time dissection was completed; <5 minutes total time), placed in TRIzol (Invitrogen), and mechanically homogenized. Total RNA was isolated using Purelink RNA Mini kits (Ambion) following manufacturer’s protocol, along with DNase treatment to reduce genomic DNA contamination. Purified total RNA was sent to the National Center for Genome Resources (Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA) for quantification, quality assessment, cDNA library preparation and sequencing. RNA integrity and purity was assessed with a Bioanalyzer 2100 instrument (Agilent Technologies). Thirty-six Illumina libraries were constructed (3 species × 4 tissues × 3 biological replicates) from the total RNA samples using Illumina TruSeq DNA prep kits according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries were barcoded using standard six base pair Illumina oligonucleotides, and six libraries were pooled for each lane of Illumina HiSeq 2000 (V3 chemistry) for a total of six lanes of 2 × 100 bp paired-end sequencing.2.1. BioinformaticsWe used the bioinformatics pipeline outlined in Figure 1 for analyzing transcriptomic data in three main steps: de novo assembly, gene annotation, and analysis of expression of duplicated genes. Adapters and barcode sequences were removed from raw reads, and reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic64 with parameter settings as follows: leading quality = 5; trailing quality = 5; minimum trimmed read length = 36). Reads were normalized in silico to maximum read coverage of 50×. Clipped and trimmed reads were assembled, de novo, for each species separately using Trinity version 2014-04-13,65,66 with minimum contig length set to 200 bp. Libraries were pooled within a species for de novo assembly, to maximize the number of genes included. Trinity assembles reads into contigs (‘Trinity transcripts’), places similar transcripts in groups loosely referred to as ‘genes’, and groups similar ‘genes’ into gene clusters.

Databases queried and software packages used are listed.Putative protein coding genes were also identified by BLASTx searches of contigs against zebrafish (Danio rerio) peptide sequences (database build Zv9) obtained from Ensembl 78.60 Significant BLAST hits were identified based on the following parameter settings: E-value < 0.0001; gap open penalty = 11; gap extend = 1; wordsize = 3. After extensive testing, this parameter combination was found to give the optimal balance between finding matches for large numbers of contigs, while minimizing spurious hits. For most genes a 1–1 match was expected between zebrafish versus Platygobio gracilis or Cyprinella lutrensis, whereas zebrafish and Cyprinus carpio should have either 1-2 or 1-1 due to partial diploidy in carp. We used this expectation in determining the threshold E-value (i.e. E < 0.0001 in this study) to use. In practice, more stringent E-value thresholds (e.g. E < 1e-6) had very little effect on the number of significant BLAST hits.Contigs with no significant BLAST hits against the zebrafish transcriptome were subjected to a series of stepwise BLASTn searches until significant hits were found (or not) in order to identify the possible sources of those sequences (e.g. microbiome7) or to identify novel genes not present in the zebrafish genome. First, remaining contigs lacking significant hits against the zebrafish transcriptome were queried against the rRNA silva database (SSU Ref 119 NR99 and LSU Parc 119), which contains bacterial and eukaryotic rRNA sequences.67 Contigs with still no significant BLAST hits were then queried against a database containing all nine additional teleost fish transcriptomes (Amazon molly, Poecilia formosa; cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus; cod, Gadus morhua; fugu, Takifugu rubripes; medaka, Oryzias latipes; platyfish, Xiphophorus maculates; stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus; tetraodon, Tetraodon nigroviridis; tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus) from Ensembl 78. Contigs with no BLAST hits at this point were then BLASTed against the zebrafish genome (Zv9) using the ‘Top Level’ sequences from Ensembl to identify possible genomic DNA contamination. Remaining contigs with no significant blast hits in any of these databases were piped to TransDecoder66 to identify open reading frames (ORFs) that represent potentially novel genes. Default parameter settings were used with TransDecoder. The software generates predicted peptide sequences for contigs with ORFs. Predicted peptide sequences for the contigs with ORFs but no BLAST hits to the aforementioned databases were queried (BLASTp; E-value < 0.001) against the NCBI nr database. Blast2GO version 3.0,68 was used to identify top species hits for those predicted proteins with significant hits against nr. The remaining sequences with no hits to databases and no ORFs were discarded as likely non-protein coding, genomic DNA contamination with sufficient divergence from zebrafish to render genomic BLASTn searches ineffective.2.2. Genome duplication, diploidization and gene silencingTrimmed sequence reads were mapped to Trinity contigs using Bowtie2 version 2.2.2.369 and corresponding gene expression was quantified with RSEM version 1.2.13.70 Because RSEM is incompatible with indel, local, and discordant alignments, parameter settings were chosen to avoid these alignments. The following RSEM parameters were used: –sensitive; –dpad 0; –gbar 99999999; –mp 1,1 –np 1 –score-min L,0,-0.1; –no-mixed; –no-discordant. Normalized expression for Trinity genes was calculated by standardizing by total mapped reads across libraries and summed across alternate Trinity transcripts (isoforms) for each locus. Networks of co-expressed genes were identified for the three species using the WGCNA package in R.71 In order to assess the expression of duplicated genes in Cyprinus carpio arising from the Cc4R duplication event, we quantified the number of Trinity genes present in each species relative to zebrafish genes, as well as their expression levels. We used an arbitrary threshold of ten sequence reads per gene per tissue, summed across all three individuals, for a given gene to be considered ‘expressed’ in a particular tissue. Note that we are comparing whether or not a gene is expressed beyond a certain threshold, as opposed to quantifying levels of expression (i.e. RNA-seq). This approach was aimed at reducing the influence of unique reads (e.g. sequencing artifacts). Most of the contigs excluded as a result were contigs represented only by singleton reads in one library.For C. carpio, we tested whether certain functional classes of genes were preferentially expressed in duplicate (i.e. the case where neither ohnolog is silenced). For this analysis, we used Panther72 to test for statistical overrepresentation of GO-slim Biological Processes, with Bonferroni correction. The test genes consisted of the list of C. carpio ohnologs expressed in duplicate, while the list of all C. carpio genes present in the assembly was used as the reference set. GO terminology was based on the zebrafish database. Results of the overrepresentation analysis were visualized with Revigo.732.3. Essential genesTo test the hypothesis of evolutionary conservation of essential genes among cyprinid fishes, we used zebrafish genes present in the Online Gene Essentiality Database OGEE;59 and identified orthologs in the three transcriptomes from BLASTx searches described above. Of the 307 essential genes in zebrafish,58,59 one (ENSDARG00000038423) has been retired from ENSEMBL and one (ENSDARG00000045605) is an unprocessed pseudogene with no protein product. We searched for the remaining 305 genes in the three transcriptome assemblies to assess their conservation across cyprinids.583. Results3.1. Sequencing and transcriptome assembliesSix lanes of Illumina sequencing produced more than 1.2 billion paired-end reads, including 420.5-, 413.9-, and 385.3-million sequences in Cyprinus carpio, Cyprinella lutrensis, and Platygobio gracilis, respectively. De novo assembly resulted in high quality transcriptomes for all three species (Table 1). The C. carpio assembly had the largest number of contigs (‘Trinity transcripts’) and genes (‘Trinity genes’), while P. gracilis had the fewest. In contrast, metrics for contig length (N25, N50, N75, median contig length, average contig length) were all longer in P. gracilis than the other two species (Table 1; Fig. 2). Overall, the P. gracilis transcriptome assembly was more complete despite fewer raw sequence reads. TransDecoder predicted ORFs in about half of all Trinity contigs (not shown), with the remainder comprised mainly of genomic DNA contamination that was filtered out of the final dataset. The N50 of predicted ORFs was only slightly shorter in the three species (i.e. 1,299–1,572 bp) than in zebrafish (CDS N50 = 2,037 bp), and similar to the recently published draft C. carpio genome 1,487 bp.40 Removal of microbiome and genomic DNA contamination from the final assembly resulted in fewer, but longer contigs (see filtering of the final dataset, below), and an overall higher-quality assembly.

However, note that we only used canonical transcripts for zebrafish and not the shorter isoforms, which skews the distribution toward longer transcripts for that species.3.2. BLAST searches: zebrafish transcriptomeTop BLASTx hits of Trinity contigs against zebrafish peptides included approximately 20,000 unique genes (ENSDARG) and 11,000 protein families (ENSFAM) present in each of the three species (Fig. 3), suggesting similar annotation efficiency and transcriptome representation for each species. However, after pooling isoforms, the number of Trinity genes that significantly matched these ~20,000 zebrafish genes varied among species: 66,447 in Cyprinus carpio, 60,990 in Cyprinella lutrensis, and 39,915 in Platygobio gracilis (Table 2, top row). Zebrafish genes were well covered, with more than 15,000 unique zebrafish genes covered over at least 70% of their length in corresponding contigs from each of the three cyprinids, consistent with the N50 data presented above. In general, zebrafish proteins were more completely covered by P. gracilis contigs than C. carpio or C. lutrensis. For example, zebrafish genes were more than 90% covered (i.e. the alignment covers >90% of bases of a gene) by sequences in 50.3% (12,489 of 24,817 genes) of P. gracilis genes with significant zebrafish peptide hits, versus 49.9% (13,453 of 26,963) for C. carpio, and 46.8% (12,538 of 26,817) in C. lutrensis. A large number of Trinity contigs did not significantly match (BLASTx) zebrafish peptide sequences and were subsequently queried against several additional databases. Significant BLAST hits for Trinity ‘genes’ versus various databases and number of ORFs present. BLAST searches were done in stepwise fashion: all Trinity genes were queried against zebrafish peptides but only genes without zebrafish peptide hits were queried against rRNA silva, and so on until all of the databases were queried.

BLAST searches: other databasesContigs lacking significant BLASTx hits against zebrafish peptides were queried (BLASTn) iteratively against rRNA silva microbiome database, nine teleost transcriptomes, and the zebrafish genome databases (Table 2). For contigs lacking hits against zebrafish peptides, BLASTn searches versus the rRNA silva database revealed a small number of significant hits (i.e. <400 contigs; Table 2). BLASTn searches of the remaining unmatched contigs versus the nine teleost fish transcriptomes identified approximately 1,500–4,500 additional hits (Table 2), far fewer than the evolutionarily more closely related zebrafish transcriptome. BLASTn searches of the remaining unidentified contigs against the zebrafish genome revealed a large number of significant hits (>30,000 per species), suggesting these reads were the result of low levels of background genomic DNA contamination in the cDNA libraries, a common occurrence resulting from the hypersensitivity of Illumina sequencing. Conservation of sequences across deep evolutionary lineages suggests functional importance, such as regulatory regions.Despite extensive BLAST searches, a large number of Trinity contigs (>100,000 in each species or more than 50% of all contigs) did not have significant hits in any of the databases. These contigs are short in length (i.e. 200 bp) and have few reads mapping to them (e.g. single-read contigs). These could represent endogenous genomic DNA contamination of cDNA libraries and have sufficient evolutionary divergence from zebrafish to render BLASTn searches ineffective. A large number are also expected to be non-rRNA sequences from the microbiome, which were not present in target databases. Of contigs with no BLAST hits in the aforementioned databases, TransDecoder predicted ORFs in 8,652 (Cyprinus carpio), 9,215 (Cyprinella lutrensis), and 3,011 (Platygobio gracilis) contigs (Table 2). Roughly half of the predicted ORFs had significant BLASTp hits against the nr protein database (3,789, 4,154, and 1,548 contigs, respectively). Conversely, there were 4,863 (C. carpio), 5,061 (C. lutrensis), and 1,463 (P. gracilis) predicted ORFs had no significant hits against nr (Table 2). These ORFs could include novel genes not present in zebrafish or other teleost models, genes present in zebrafish but with significantly divergent sequences to cause BLAST searches to miss them, or could include genes from the microbiome that are not present in sequence databases.For ORFs with nr hits, zebrafish was the top-hit species for a large portion (Fig. 4), somewhat paradoxically given the lack of significant BLAST hits against zebrafish peptide and genome sequences discussed above. This appears to be due to the fact that TransDecoder-predicted ORFs exclude 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) which diverge more rapidly than ORFs over evolutionary time. In C. carpio and C. lutrensis, many of these ORFs are from a diverse microbiome with many sequences sharing significant similarity to cyclophyllid tapeworms (e.g. Echinococcus, Hymenolepis) and protozoans (e.g. Tetrahymena, Parameceum). Conversely, in P. gracilis the ORFs appear to be endogenous genes with high similarity to zebrafish (Fig. 4), i.e. a less diverse microbiome is present. Contigs with predicted ORFs but no BLAST hits to any of the databases possibly represent novel or functionally divergent genes in these species that warrant further study. Top-species BLASTp hits for predicted open reading frame (ORF) peptide sequences queried against the nr database. Query sequences only included ORFs from contigs that lacked significant BLAST hits (see Table 2).

Query sequences only included ORFs from contigs that lacked significant BLAST hits (see Table 2). Grey bars represent fish or other chordates, while black bars represent non-chordate taxa.3.4. Filtering and the final assembly datasetsAfter filtering and removal of genomic DNA and microbiome reads, the final de novo assembly datasets contained only Trinity contigs falling into one of the following categories: (i) contigs with significant BLAST hits against zebrafish or the nine other teleost transcriptomes; or (ii) contigs with no matches against any of the databases but with predicted ORFs present, i.e. potentially novel genes. All other contigs were removed via bioinformatic filtering. While it is possible that some of the ‘microbiome’ hits are actually external contamination, we expect this to be a minor component given the diverse nature of these sequences in terms of top-hit organism (Fig. 4). It is also possible that some of the genes that significantly align against zebrafish are actually microbiome or contaminant reads, though these genes being target species DNA is a more parsimonious conclusion. The final datasets are significantly smaller than the raw de novo assembly but present much more reliable sequence information, i.e. transcriptome sequences rather than microbiome or genomic DNA contamination.3.5. Genome duplication, diploidization and gene silencingTranscriptome annotation and comparison with zebrafish revealed that Cyprinus carpio expresses more genes than Cyprinella lutrensis and Platygobio gracilis, due to the Cc4R duplication (Fig. 5). Cyprinus carpio expressed about 41% more genes overall than P. gracilis and 11% more than C. lutrensis. The number of duplicate genes expressed varied dramatically among tissue types (Fig. 5). In all tissues except skin, C. carpio expressed more genes than the other two species (i.e. 3–48% more). In skin, both C. lutrensis and P. gracilis expressed more genes than C. carpio (26 and 2%, respectively). Using higher thresholds for ‘expression’ had moderate impact on the inferred percentage of duplicates expressed: a threshold of 100 reads instead of 10 resulted in different estimates of duplicated genes expressed in C. carpio versus P. gracilis (18% more in C. carpio) and C. lutrensis (8% more in C. carpio), i.e. retained expression of Cc4R duplicates. The disparity in these results could be driven in part by different assembly qualities (e.g. a better assembled P. gracilis transcriptome). WGCNA analysis revealed broadly similar patterns of blocks of co-expressed genes across species, consistent with the phylogenetic relatedness of the three species (Fig. 6).

One functional grouping that was a predominant contributor in the Revigo analysis was ‘anatomical structure morphogenesis,’ of interest because common carp attain much larger body size than the other two species (Fig. 7, bottom panel).

Expression of essential genesGenes that are essential for embryonic development in D. rerio were nearly all present in the three cyprinids: 285 (Platygobio gracilis), 301 (Cyprinella lutrensis), and 301 (Cyprinus carpio) genes were expressed out of 305 zebrafish essential genes (i.e. 93.4–97.8%). Of the 20 essential genes that we did not detect in P. gracilis, only one was also missing in C. lutrensis, and two were shared with C. carpio. No missing essential genes were shared between C. lutrensis and C. carpio, of the four missing in each species. Essential genes missing in one or more species were generally expressed at low levels in the other species. Essential genes were nearly ubiquitously expressed across all four tissue types (skin, gill, gut, kidney), with low levels of tissue specificity (Fig. 8), in contrast to non-essential genes which generally exhibited higher levels of tissue specificity. A few essential genes do exhibit patterns of tissue specificity or species-specificity. For example, C. carpio expresses more essential genes in the gut than the other two species, including genes such as wdr46 and exosc8, which are missing in both of the other species. Normalized levels of expression were higher in C. carpio than P. gracilis and C. lutrensis for 165 and 204 out of 305 genes, respectively. This pattern was not due to C. carpio expressing more loci per zebrafish gene (e.g. Ohnologs) than the other two species. Only slightly more loci (e.g. n = 2 contigs) were expressed per essential gene in the recently duplicated C. carpio genome (Fig. 9) whereas most duplicated essential genes in C. carpio are not transcribed and have either been lost evolutionarily, e.g. pseudogenes, or are expressed in other developmental stages or tissues.

DiscussionNext-generation transcriptome sequencing has revolutionized the field of molecular ecology over the past decade.4,74 One outcome is increased appreciation for the molecular complexity underlying the evolution of basic ecological traits.75,76 Here we present transcriptomic resources for comparative study of non-model cyprinid fishes in a natural ‘common-garden’ setting. Previous work, along with our bioinformatic analyses demonstrate that careful processing and filtering is needed to assess the sources of DNA fragments, which can be endogenous target transcriptome sequences, genomic DNA ‘contamination’ from the study organism, or DNA from the microbiome or diet items. Assessment of transcriptome quality also requires careful consideration.77,78 Traditional measures of assembled read lengths such as N50 are largely meaningless for transcriptomes without additional context. We advocate combining N50 and/or histograms of contig lengths with explicit comparisons to well-studied transcriptomes of model organisms, when available. For example, we compared our de novo transcriptomes to zebrafish, which yielded valuable insight into progress made in our target species. Finally, positive identification of nearly all zebrafish essential genes in our transcriptomes provides additional evidence of the utility of our annotation procedures. Using the bioinformatics pipeline presented in Fig. 1, we obtained high quality transcriptome data from three species of cyprinid fishes with distinctly different evolutionary histories.Our specific aims in this study were to sequence, annotate, and assemble the transcriptomes of co-occurring fishes with the goal of developing resources for ongoing studies of the evolution and molecular ecology of North American cyprinids. This comparative transcriptome dataset offers tools to construct assays to pose and test hypotheses related to differences in DNA sequences, functional pathways, and expression patterns among organisms that are more or less closely related (i.e. comparative approach), but that also co-occur in nature and experience similar biotic and abiotic conditions, including exposure to similar suites of pathogens and water quality conditions, for example. These data are also a resource for identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in transcribed genes,79 which could be used to explore functional or phenotypic variation within and among species.There are several key findings in this study, including: (i) high-quality transcriptome assemblies for cyprinid fishes that reveal broad similarities and evolutionary conservation of genes with zebrafish, but with some key differences; (ii) several potentially novel genes not identified in zebrafish that are candidates for studies of ecological and morphological novelty; (iii) diverse microbiomes that vary substantially among species, despite origin from a single collection locality; (iv) ubiquitous expression of essential genes for development in later ontogenetic stages (i.e. juveniles and adults) across a broad array of tissue types; (v) a large number of duplicate genes expressed in the tetraploid, Cyprinus carpio, representing a diverse suite of biological processes or gene ontologies. We discuss each of these findings in greater detail below.4.1. Assembly resultsThere are important considerations associated with conducting transcriptome analysis in a non-laboratory setting and in species lacking high-quality, well-annotated genomes.4,80,81 For example, it is necessary to identify ways to maximize the quality and completeness of de novo assemblies.77,80,82 Our assemblies are somewhat less complete than the zebrafish reference, but this was expected because zebrafish has been sequenced extensively at the genomic DNA level, empirically validated with RNA-seq, and refined by years of manual curation.Trinity assemblies resulted in proportionally fewer long contigs (e.g. > 1,000 bp) compared to zebrafish. Four factors account for this result. First, the microbiome is present in these sequences and many of the contigs are not endogenous, as reflected by top species hits in BLAST searches (Fig. 4). Second, a small amount of genomic DNA contamination persists despite DNase treatment during library preparation. Genomic contamination tends to be observed as short (e.g. 200 bp), shallow contigs often comprised of single-reads. Third, the de novo assemblies are more fragmented due to the short read technology employed, with multiple contigs often representing non-overlapping fragments of the same gene. This effect is particularly acute in genes with short sequence repeats (e.g. microsatellites). Finally, we only used the canonical zebrafish transcripts in this study, which excludes the shorter isoforms present in many genes and biases the zebrafish distribution toward longer sequences. Transcriptomes presented here represent an improvement (i.e. more sequences, higher coverage; longer relative N50) over earlier work on sequencing and assembling the common carp transcriptome using Roche 454 sequencing,39,51 due to the higher throughput, Illumina paired-end sequencing approach we employed. The bioinformatic approach we presented to identify and filter non-target sequences from the final dataset resulted in high quality and well annotated assemblies.4.2. Potentially novel genesResults of BLAST searches and ORF predictions helped us identify candidate genes that may represent novel species- or taxon-specific genes. Our interest in these genes lies in the idea that they may contain some of the functional elements responsible for extensive ecological and phylogenetic diversity present in the Cyprinidae, as in previous studies of lineage-specific gene family expansions.83–85 For example, expansion of the patristacin gene family in pipefish may be an important driver in the evolution of male pregnancy in that lineage.85 Many of the potentially novel genes we identified may prove to be false positives as more fish genomes are sequenced and annotated; however, these candidates would be an excellent starting point for researchers interested in targeted searches for genes or proteins underlying ecological novelty in cyprinids that may have arisen through local gene duplications, exon shuffling, horizontal transfer, or other mechanisms.4.3. Microbiome diversityAnother valuable aspect of transcriptome sequencing of samples taken from nature is the simultaneous generation of quantifiable data on the microbiome.86 These data are applicable to study of host-parasite dynamics, immune response, paired comparative population genetics or phylogeographic analysis of host and microbiota. When generating de novo transcriptome assemblies for focal species, it is imperative that microbiome sequences are identified and filtered out of final assemblies.87 Genome-scale sequence data is often lacking for the bacterial and metazoan microbiota on vertebrate samples, which complicates attempts at removal. We used an iterative and successive filtering approach to address this issue (Fig. 1) that provides valuable information on the likely source (e.g. exogenous or endogenous) of particular sequences or contigs. Transcriptome characterization studies often do not attempt to remove exogenous microbiome and genomic DNA contamination. Researchers should be cautious when using unfiltered sequence reads, particularly when they are compiled into massive databases that lack appropriate metadata.4.4. Conservation of essential genesGenes that are essential for embryonic development present interesting targets for studying genome evolution due to their critical functional importance.58,88,89 Essential genes also bear biomedical significance as many have been implicated in human diseases and developmental abnormalities.88 Our data demonstrate that essential ‘developmental’ genes previously identified in larval zebrafish58,59 are almost all ubiquitously expressed in juvenile or adults across a broad range of tissues, suggesting their importance is not simply limited to early ontogenetic stages or particular tissues. Previous work has shown that many of these genes are critical for basic cell function, which may underlie their ubiquitous expression.58 Based on the critical functions they perform, these genes are candidates for future studies looking at the cause of high rates of genetic inviability and mortality in cyprinids and other organisms with type-III life histories.90 From a practical standpoint, however, we suggest that the ubiquitous expression of these genes makes their sequencing coverage and completeness useful metrics that should be used to assess the quality and completeness of de novo transcriptome assemblies, analogous to the use of ‘housekeeping’ genes as positive controls in qPCR studies.91 The presence of nearly all essential genes across these four cyprinid species (representing more than 100 million years of evolutionary divergence92) is consistent with the hypothesis of broad evolutionary and functional conservation.58,61 The few essential genes not detected may still be present in the genome, but were missed due to assembly errors or are expressed transiently at larval or juvenile developmental stages. We propose that the number of essential genes expressed could be used as a metric to complement other measures of assembly quality and completeness,77 in addition to comparing transcript length histograms to closely related model species (see Fig. 2). While beyond the scope of the present study, future work should compare the utility of these metrics for assessing transcriptome assemblies.4.5. Tetraploidy and expression of duplicated genesOur results indicated that a large number of duplicate genes are expressed in Cyprinus carpio, representing a diverse suite of biological processes or gene ontologies, similar to previous studies.39,40,51 For genes where both Ohnologs were expressed in C. carpio, there was enrichment in several different functional pathways, but many genes were associated with ‘anatomical structure morphogenesis’ in particular (Fig. 7). Functional duplicates at these genes correlate with large body size and rapid growth in C. carpio as compared to C. lutrensis and P. gracilis and a potential dosage effect. Using a different set of tissues, Wang et al.39 identified enrichment of retained expression of duplicates in gene ontology pathways involved in metabolic and immune functions using 454 transcriptome sequencing and EST data mining. The availability of a (draft) genome for common carp40 will eventually help identify Ohnologs that are silenced because pseudogenes of silenced genes may still be present in genomic DNA sequences; currently, the incomplete annotation of that genome precludes analysis of gene silencing at the genomic DNA level. Ultimately, knowledge of which genes are retained and expressed in duplicate in tetraploids as compared to related diploid species can provide insight into the role that whole genome duplication plays in the molecular ecology and phylogenetic diversification of organisms.93,94 Note that our analyses and those of Wang et al.39 are based only on expressed genes in particular tissues at a single time point, rather than genomic DNA sequences and consequently would not include Ohnologs expressed only in different tissues or at different time points. The recent Cc4R allotetraploidy event35,95,96 complicates transcriptome assembly because there has been little time for divergence of Ohnologs e.g, 8.2 million years.40 In autopolyploid salmonids, the fourth round of whole genome duplication is much older i.e. 90–102 ma;97 yet many Ohnologous loci are difficult to separate via bioinformatic approaches. Some loci even maintain tetrasomic inheritance because of the autopolyploid nature of the duplication.98 These factors need to be explicitly considered when conducting analyses that require orthologous alignments, such as RNA-seq and syntenic mapping, when working with polyploid or partially diploidized species.384.6. SummaryResults from short read sequences yield high-quality transcriptome resources for comparative study of cyprinids, a hyper-diverse clade of fishes. We used a variety of bioinformatic tools for assembly quality assessment, gene annotation, orthology assignment, and identification and partitioning of exogenous DNA in wild cyprinid fishes. This approach facilitates technology transfer from a model organism (zebrafish) to a group of related species that fill diverse and critical roles in these ecosystems and comprise an important component of biodiversity. Conserved expression of essential developmental genes across a broad phylogenetic scope, later ontogenetic stages, and array of tissue types, illustrates their utility as benchmarks for assessing coverage in de novo assemblies. Moreover, their ubiquitous expression further supports the hypothesis that these genes are required for the basic biology of cyprinid fish and are candidate loci for developmental abnormalities and disease. Finally, comparative transcriptomics must contend with genome duplications and other genomic ‘events’ that affect gene identity and expression. Nonetheless, comparative approaches could provide enormous power to identify shared and unique physiological pathways that respond to common environmental stressors in a natural setting.4.7.

IntroductionThe causal agent of frogeye leaf spot (FLS), Cercospora sojina Hara, is a worldwide destructive pathogen on soybean.1 It was first reported in Japan in 1915.2 After that, many soybean growing countries were reported the occurrence of this disease, such as the USA, China, and Argentina.3 The main measurement to control this disease is to grow resistant soybean varieties or to apply chemical fungicides, which usually lose the effects rapidly in fields due to race differentiation and gene mutations of the pathogen.4–6 FLS causes about 10–60% yield loss in soybean growing regions, such as Argentina and Nigeria, and it has been reported to be the most expensive disease in the history of soybean production in Argentina.3Taxonomically, C. sojina belongs to the order Capnodiales in the class of Dothideomycetes. Currently, it is known that there are 22 races of C. sojina in Brazil and 12 races in the USA.1 Later, using 93 isolates of C. sojina and 38 putative soybean differentials, Mian et al. proposed a core set of 11 races that represent the major diversity of the 93 isolates in the USA.1 We previously reported the 14 races in north China7; of the identified races of C. sojina, the occurrence frequency of race 1 is 43.5%, emerging as the dominant race among others, which causes yield loss up to 38% in the field.7Despite the importance of C. sojina, the infection mechanism and the genetic information are not known for this pathogen. For example, most of the species can produce a non-specific coloured mycotoxin cercosporin in the Cercospora genus, which is indispensable for their pathogenicity,8 but C. sojina may not produce cercosporin.9 Does the genome harbour the cercosporin biosynthesis genes? Nowadays, the main strategy to unravel the mystery of the pathogen infection mechanisms is to obtain their genome information. Magnaporthe grisea, one of the best studied fungi, was sequenced at genome level in 2005.10 The genome annotation shows that the pathogen may carry over 700 secreted proteins, and most of them are believed to be virulence effectors. Later, several effectors have been implicated in suppressing immune responses in rice.11,12 The other genes, such as MoEnd3, MoSwi6, and MoHYR1 have been demonstrated to be essential for appressorium formation, melanin accumulation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging.13–15 Similarly, the genome sequence availability and gene annotation have helped to uncover the infection mechanism of Verticillium dahliae substantially, where this pathogen shows distinct infection structure compared with M. oryzae and other fungi.16,17Although the breeding programme and fungicide application make great success in controlling FLS in last decades, their efficiencies are facing challenges recently.4,7 In fact, Cercospora species may undergo positive selections and rapid evolution. Soares et al. reported that more Cercospora species were able to infect soybean and caused similar disease symptom as C. kikuchii, the closest species of C. sojina.3 Importantly, they detected interlineage recombination among Cercospora species, along with a high frequency of mutations linked to fungicide resistance.3 Moreover, it has been observed that C. sojina populations are genetically diverse and likely undergoing sexual reproduction.18 The above-mentioned reports imply that C. sojina could adapt to the changing environment flexibly.In this study, we report the 40.8 Mb complete genome sequence of C. sojina race 1. The genome annotation and whole genome transcriptome assays reveal that C. sojina encodes a different set of proteins that distinguishes it from other fungi species in terms of infection strategy and disease development. We demonstrate that the secondary metabolites and effectors play essential roles in the soybean–C. sojina pathosystem. Moreover, the genome information can be further used for comparative genomic studies with other Cercospora species to unravel their evolution and infection mechanism on soybean.2. Materials and methods2.1. Fungal growth conditions and DNA preparationCercospora sojina (C. sojina) race 1 was isolated from soybean fields in Heilong Jiang province of China. Briefly, the fungi single spore was isolated from the soybean seedling infested by C. sojina race 1. The isolated spores were grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium at 28°C. Then, the mycelia were removed from the media and ground in liquid nitrogen. Genomic DNA was extracted using a modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method.192.2. Genome sequencing and assemblyCercosporasojina race1 genome was sequenced by Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) method in Biomarker Technologies (Beijing, China).20 DNA libraries with 270 bp and 10 kb inserts were constructed. The 270-bp library was constructed following Illumina’s standard protocol, including fragmentation of genomic DNA, end repair, adaptor ligation and PCR amplification. The 270-bp library was quantified using 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA) and subjected to paired-ended 150 bp sequencing by Illumina HiSeq4000. The sequencing data (filtered reads: 2.99G, sequencing depth: 90×) were used to estimate the genome size, repeat content, and heterozygosity. Then, the 10-kb library was constructed following PacBio’s standard methods, including fragmentation of genomic DNA, end repair, adaptor ligation, and templates purification. The 10-kb library was quantified by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA) and sequenced by SMRT, and the sequencing data (filtered reads: 4.92G, sequencing depth: 123×) was assembled by CANU (Version-1.2) with default parameters.21 Finally, Illumina reads were used for error correction and gap filling with SOAPdenovo GAPCLOSER v1.12.222.3. Genome annotationsProtein-encoding genes were annotated by a combination of three independent ab initio predicators GeneMark (Version 4.30),23 SNAP24, and Glimmer.25 Transcriptome data were incorporated into PASA26 to improve quality of C. sojina annotation. Briefly, the transcriptome assemblies were mapped to the genome using Trinity.27 Then PASA alignment assemblies based on overlapping transcript alignments from Trinity and use EVidenceModeler (EVM) to compute weighted consensus gene structure annotations. Finally, PASA was used to update the EVM consensus predictions. Functional annotations for all predicted gene models were made using multiple databases, including Swiss-Prot, nr, KEGG28, and COG29 by blastP with E-values of =1e-5. Domain-calling analyses of protein-encoding genes were performed using the Pfam database30 and HMMER.31 Potential virulence-related proteins were identified by searching against the pathogen–host interaction database (PHI-base)32 by blastP with E-values of =1e-5. Blast2GO33 was used for Go enrichment analysis of genes that only belong to C. sojina, and do not have homologue in the non-plant pathogen Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa. 2.4. Repetitive sequences and whole genome DNA methylation analysisTandem repeat sequences were identified using Tandem Repeats Finder (TrF).34 Transposable elements (TEs) were excavated strictly using three softwares, including a de novo software Repeat Modeler (http://repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler/) and two database-based softwares Repeat Protein Masker (www.repeatmasker.org/cgi-bin/RepeatProteinMaskRequest) and Repeat Masker (www.repeatmasker.org/). All the parameters are set as default. Whole-genome DNA modification detection and motif analysis were performed according to Blow et al.35 using the PacBio SMRT software (version = 2.2.3, www.pacb.com). 2.5. Phylogenetic analysis and synteny analysisThe sequences of fungi were downloaded from DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI).36 A group of consistent phylogenetic ‘backbone’ genes (phylogeneticly conserved) in the fungi genome were used to construct phylogenetic tree.37 Putative ‘backbone’ genes of the other 11 fungi were identified using stand-alone blast with E-values of =1e-20. And the ‘backbone’ genes were concatenated into one sequence. Sequence alignment was done using MUSCLE38 and the phylogenetic tree was generated by MEGA 7.039 using a UPGMA method. Ustilago maydis was used as outgroup. Synteny of Cercospora zeae-maydis, C. sojina, and Pseudocercospora fijiensis was analysed using GATA.402.6. Comparison analysis of carbohydrate-active enzymes and secondary metabolism genesThe proteome of C. sojina and 14 other above-mentioned fungal species were downloaded from DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI).36 HMMER 3.0 packages were used for homology search.41 Family-specific HMM profiles were downloaded from dbCAN database.42 The executable file hmmscan and the hmmscan-parser script provided by dbCAN were used to generate and extract the searching results, respectively.Putative polyketide synthases (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPS) genes were identified using the web-based software SMURF with default settings.43 The modules of different domains in individual NRPS and PKS proteins were identified via searching the antiSMASH database (antibiotics and Secondary Metabolite Analysis Shell).44 The core genes were annotated using stand-alone BLAST (E-values =1e-10) against Swiss-Prot database.2.7. Secondary metabolites extraction and quantificationCercosporin extraction and quantification were performed according to the method described by Shim and Dunkle.45 The pigments of C. sojina were induced in the complete medium (CM) with 20 mmol/l cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) or starvation treatments for 4 days at 28°C. The supernatants were collected and purified by the C18-SPE cartridge. The elutes in 40% methanol fraction were further purified by a HPLC on C18 preparation column. The fractions with grey, light yellow, and dark grey were further identified by a reverse phase HPLC with a PDA detector (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan).2.8. Transcriptome analysis and quantitative RT-PCRFor transcriptome analysis, the fungus was grown in minimal nutrient medium (3 g NaNO3, 1 g K2HPO4, 0.5 g MgSO4·7H2O, 0.5 g KCl, 0.01 g FeSO4, and 30 g Sucrose per litre) at 28°C for 6 days. For starvation treatment, the fungal mycelia was transferred to minimal nutrient medium lacking NaNO3, then was harvested at 24 and 48 h, respectively. Each treatment had three biological replicates.Library preparation and bioinformatics analysis were performed according to the method of Yang et al.46 One microgram RNA per sample was subjected to RNA-seq library construction. The RNA-seq libraries were quantified using 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA), and sequenced (paired-end, 100 bp each) by the Illumina genome analyzer (Hiseq 2000; Illumina, USA). Quantification of gene expression levels were estimated by fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped. Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq R package.For quantitative RT-PCR, infected leaves were collected at indicated time points. Total RNA was extracted by Trizol method (Invitrogen). The cDNAs were synthesized using HiScript II Q RT SuperMix kit with genomic DNA wiper (Vazyme Biotech). Reactions were performed on CFX96TM Real-time System (Bio-RAD) with the SYBR qPCR Mix (Vazyme Biotech). The 2-<U+0394><U+0394>CT method was used for calculating the relative gene expression levels. Actin gene of C. sojina was used as the internal control.2.9. Functional study of putative effectorsThe putative effector genes were cloned into binary vector pMD-1 (T7 tag) driven by 35S promoter using ClonExpress II One Step Cloning Kit (Vazyme Biotech). Then, these constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 by electroporation. Leaves of 4-week-old Nicotiana benthamiana were infiltrated with EHA105 strains harbouring indicated effectors using needleless syringes. GFP and Phytophothora sojae effector Avr1b served as the negative control and positive control, respectively. Twenty-four hours later, plants were infiltrated with EHA105 harbouring pVX-BAX (OD600 = 0.4). Cell death symptoms were evaluated and photographed at 72 h after pVX-BAX infiltration. Results are representatives of six biological replicates.3. Results3.1. Assembly of C. sojina genomeLike most of the fungi, C. sojina showed similar infection cycle, but it also demonstrated some distinctions (Supplementary Fig. S1). It does not form appressorium, but infects the plants by branched hyphae through open stomata (Supplementary Fig. S1C and D). Compared with other hemibiotrophic fungi, FLS disease development is relatively slower (Supplementary Fig. S1C). In order to investigate the infection mechanism, we therefore extracted the genomic DNA from the mycelia and sequenced the pathogen at genome level.The genome of C. sojina race 1 was assembled from the data generated by a recently developed Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing technique, an effective method to decode the difficulty to detect but important regions, such as non-coding regions and repetitive elements, which can assist in obtaining gapless eukaryotic genome sequence.20Subreads distribution analyses confirm the high quality of the 10-kb library (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S1). The sequencing data (4,920,479,113 bp clean reads) were de novo assembled using CANU,21 leading to the generation of 62 contigs, with an N50 length of 1.59 Mb and a total assembly size around ~40.84 Mb (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). Twenty-four largest scaffolds were displayed by circos-plot (Fig. 1). A total of 11,655 protein-coding genes are predicted, in which the gene density is ~285 genes per 1 Mb. However, 277 tRNA and 281 pseudogenes are predicted in the genome. Notably, 8,474 putative protein-coding genes were supported by the RNA-seq data. It is also worth noting that the genome size of C. sojina race 1 is much larger than C. sojina isolate S9, where the genome was assembled by 124 bp library and genome size was estimated around ~30.8 M.47Genome features of Cercospora sojinaGenome features of Cercospora sojinaCircos-plot of C. sojina.

Repetitive elements and potential methylation sitesRepetitive DNA sequence and TEs play important roles in the evolution, the genome structure, and gene functions of fungi.48 A total of 11,138,239 bp (~11 M) repeat sequences were identified in C. sojina genome, including DNA transposon, LTR retrotransposon, tandem repeat sequence and other unclassified transposons (Fig. 2A). The repeat sequence accounts for 25.56% of the genome. Interestingly, the majority of repetitive sequences (96.36%) are TEs, whereas the tandem repeat sequences just account for 0.93%. Notably, DNA transposon and LTR retrotransposons account for 28 and 25% of all TEs, respectively. Repeat elements and DNA methylation sites of C. sojina.

However, majority of methylation sites (8,453,041) were uncategorized. Interestingly, most of the categorized DNA methylations are m4C, accounting for 98.3%, whereas m6A only accounts for 1.7%. In consistent with the identified methylation sites, we detect multiple motifs that may be recognized by transmethylase specifically (Supplementary Table S3). However, compared with m6A, m4C DNA methylations occur with low frequency in the regions of repetitive elements (Fig. 2C–E).3.3. Comparative genomic analysisThe evolutionary relationship of C. sojina and other fungi species was analysed using a group of phylogenetic backbone genes of the fungi.37 Phylogenetic analysis reveals that C. sojina is evolutionally close to Cercospora zeae-maydis, a plant pathogen that can cause leaf spot disease on maize52 (Fig. 3A). In addition, C. sojina is also close to the other three Dothideomycetes pathogen Pseudocercospora fijiensis, Sphaerulina musiva, and Dothistroma septosporum (Fig. 3A). The C. sojina homologous proteins show an average identity of 79.9, 65.9, 67.5, and 65.8% with that of C. zeae-maydis, P. fijiensis, S. musiva, and D. septosporum, respectively.

Non-coding regions are not depicted.Although C. sojina is evolutionarily distant from the non-plant pathogen Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa, 47.18 and 43.07% proteins of C. sojina have homologues in A. nidulans and N. crassa, respectively. Therefore, we examined the potential gene family expansions in C. sojina. The results show that 5,652 genes exclusively exist in C. sojina genome but not in A. nidulans and N. crassa. However, near 70% of these genes cannot be annotated from current databases (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Go enrichment analysis of the 1,675 annotated genes reveals that most of the genes are involved in metabolic process, biosynthetic process, and response to stresses or stimuli (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Notably, these genes are predicted to have binding function (ion binding or protein binding), hydrolase activity, transferase activity or oxidoreductase activity (Supplementary Fig. S3C). As C. sojina is evolutionarily distant from the non-plant pathogens, we speculate that the gene family expansion, a common event in the evolution of phytopathogenic fungi,52,53 might have occurred in C. sojina genome, which eventually makes C. sojina be a plant pathogen.In addition, synteny analysis of C. sojina genome with the other three genomes of Dothideomycetes spp., the C. zeae-maydis, P. fijiensis, and Mycosphaerella graminicola, reveals that C. sojina genome displays different synteny with those fungi (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S4). Of all the sequenced genomes, C. zeae-maydis shows highest synteny with C. sojina. For example, scaffolds 2, 4, and 5 of C. zeae-maydis correspond well with the scaffold 1 of C. sojina, and Scaffold 3 and 10 show well syntney to the scaffold 3 of C. sojina (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Importantly, we observed that the 24 largest scaffolds, which accounts for 91.2% of C. sojina genome, show very high synteny with the 13 core chromosomes of M. graminicola,53 but not with the rest 8 dispersed chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S4C), indicating that C. sojina shares the conserved and core genes of Dothideomycetes.3.4. The secretome and potential effectorsThe genome of C. sojina contains 11,655 protein-coding genes, covering approximately 41% sequence of the genome (Table 1). Among them, a total of 9,506 genes were annotated using multiple databases (Supplementary Fig. S5 and Table S4). Domain calling analysis reveals that more than 7,500 types of domains exist in C. sojina proteome. The arsenal of potentially secreted proteins were predicted, and proteins containing a signal peptide, but lacking transmembrane domain and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) modification site were considered as secreted proteins. A combination of software tools for the prediction of transmembrane domain,54 signal peptide motifs,55 and GPI modification site indicate that C. sojina has similar number of potential secreted proteins (~750) when compared with other fungal species.56Pathogen-secreted effectors play critical roles in facilitating the proliferation of pathogens, often by suppressing plant immune system.57 In total, 233 proteins are predicted as the putative small (=400 amino acids) cysteine-rich (=4 cysteine residues) proteins. Through domain calling analysis, 205 functional motifs and domains were found in 141 putative effectors, including 60 effectors with multiple domains. Notably, the most abundant domain is PF14295.4 (n = 6), which mediates protein-protein interactions. Other common domains include abhydrolase domain (PF12697.5, n = 5), Hydrolase domain (PF12146.6, n = 5), and PAN domain (PF00024.24, n = 5).3.5. Up-regulation of pathogenicity-related genes by whole genome transcription assaysBecause the infection progress of C. sojina on soybean is very slow, it is difficult to collect enough samples to examine the gene expression of the in planta hyphae. However, starvation treatments could mimic the physiology of pathogen during infection.58 Therefore, we used the mycelia that were grown in nutrient-limited culture for 24 and 48 h, and performed transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing; 3,227 and 3,223 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at 24 and 48 h post-starvation treatment (hpt), respectively (Supplementary Fig. S6). A total of 4,051 DEGs were identified during starvation treatment, and 2,399 genes were differentially expressed at both 24 and 48 hpt. Of all the DEGs, 1,530 and 1,508 genes were upregulated, while 1,697 and 1,715 genes were downregulated at 24 and 48 hpt, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S6).Notably, four classes of DEGs caused our attention. These genes are annotated to be involved in PHI, secretome, putative carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), and secondary metabolic processes. First, 1,036 PHI genes are differentially expressed after starvation treatment (Supplementary Fig. S7A). A total of 591 PHI genes are significantly upregulated, demonstrating the important roles of these genes in responding to stimulus. Second, 260 secreted protein-coding genes, including 81 effectors, are differentially expressed (Supplementary Fig. S7B). There is 62.5% (50/80) effector-coding gene expression being significantly upregulated, and some effectors with conserved domains, such as Wall Stress-responsive Component domain, glycoside hydrolase, fungal hydrophobin, cutinase, leucine rich repeat or peptidase domains, may play critical roles in fungal pathogenicity (Supplementary Table S5). Third, 198 CAZymes were differentially expressed. Interestingly, almost half of them are glycoside hydrolases (87/198), implying their essential roles in early infection (Supplementary Fig. S7C). Further, the secondary metabolism-related genes, including 5 PKS and 16 NRPS/NRPS-like genes are significantly upregulated (Supplementary Fig. S7D). These genes are likely involved in mycotoxin biosynthesis in fungi. Therefore, the increased expression of PKS and NRPS/NRPS-like genes suggests that these genes may play essential roles in mycotoxins biosynthesis (Supplementary Table S6).3.6. Gene clusters for secondary metabolitesCercosporasojina genome encodes 16 non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), 20 PKS, 18 fatty acid synthases, 3 terpene synthases, 2 geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases, and 1 terpenoid cyclases (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8). These enzymes are involved in synthesis of secondary metabolites, including mycotoxins, pigments, and alkaloids. Annotation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes shows that C. sojina lacks PKS-NRPS hybrids, PKS-like proteins, and dimethylallyl tryptophan synthases (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8).In the Cercospora genus, most of the species can produce a non-specific mycotoxin cercosporin. However, it has been disputed that if C. sojina produces cercosporin.9 Nevertheless, we identified a similar gene cluster with eight cercosporin biosynthesis genes in C. sojina genome (Fig. 4A). These eight genes display high amino acid sequence similarity to C. nicotianae cercosporin biosynthesis genes in the same tandem order (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we observed the increased transcription of the eight genes during infection (Fig. 4B). These data imply that C. sojina may produce cercosporin during infection. However, we were unable to detect the cercosporin in either cultured mycelium or infected plant tissue according to the method that was used in other Cercospora species (Supplementary Fig. S8). Putative gene clusters for cercosporin biosynthesis in C. sojina. (A) The eight cercosporin toxin biosynthetic genes in C. sojina genome.

Generally, pathogen-produced pigment is able to protect pathogen from host oxidative stress during infection.59 We found that C. sojina genome encodes multiple putative PKS that are responsible for pigment production (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table S7). We also found that C. sojina can produce some grey pigments, and the pigment was significantly induced by both starvation and cAMP treatments (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the pigments may be related to pathogen virulence. Therefore, we further isolated and partially purified the pigments. Three major components, the grey, the light yellow, and the dark grey pigments were obtained (Supplementary Fig. S9), and the dark grey pigment is the most abundant one.

Carbohydrate-active enzymesSuccessful phytopathogenic fungi can break down and utilize the plant cell wall polysaccharides by CAZymes. Cercosporasojina harbours 596 predicted CAZymes (Supplementary Table S9). Compared with other fungi in Dothideomycetes, C. sojina has a larger group of potential carbohydrate esterases, which can catalyze the O-de- or N-deacylation of substituted saccharides60,61 (Supplementary Table S9). In C. sojina genome, there are around 23.5% potential secreted proteins (177/752) that were predicted as CAZyme, demonstrating that C. sojina may employ a large group of CAZymes to digest host cell walls during invasion.Interestingly, one of the families of CAZymes, the glycoside hydrolase GH109 family, is highly enriched (Fig. 6). The biochemical function of GH109 family is proved to be a-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (aNAGAL), which can cleave the terminal alpha-linked N-acetylgalactosamine epitope of blood group A.62 However, it has been shown that soybean lectin can specifically bind N-acetyl galactosamine, a component of fungal cell wall.63 These data suggest that aNAGAL may be able to compete with lectin to bind N-acetylgalactosamine. We find that C. sojina encodes 14 putative GH109 genes, which is more than most of fungi, such as M. oryzae, B. cinerea, and N. crassa (Supplementary Table S10). These data suggest that the expansion of GH109 family in C. sojina may contribute to overcome lectin-mediated resistance in soybean.

The numbers of gene families were normalized by Z score.Of the annotated carbohydrate esterase genes, family CE1 and CE10 are two major subfamilies (Fig. 6). Both families encode proteins with the common activities of carboxylesterase and endo-1,4-ß-xylanase.64 Besides, 34 potential carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) proteins were identified in C. sojina genome (Supplementary Table S9), which can digest carbohydrate complex extracellularly.64 Unexpectedly, only one CBM protein CBM1 was found in C. sojina genome (Supplementary Table S9). However, many phytopathogenic fungi carry plenty of CBM1. For example, Verticillium dahlia has an expansion of CBM1 containing protein family (~30 genes).653.8. Functional analysis of putative effectorsEffectors are low molecular weight proteins that are secreted by bacteria, oomycetes or fungi to impair the host immune defence and to adapt to specific environment. In the maize pathogen U. maydis, it was observed that most of the genes in secreted protein-coding gene clusters were induced simultaneously in infected tissue.66 Phylogenetic analysis for 233 putative effectors reveals that 21 predicted effectors are grouped into clusters that contain 2 or 3 high sequence similarity genes in C. sojina (Fig. 7A). Clusters of putative effectors also suggest that local duplications might be involved in expansion of effectors in C. sojina. In addition, 40 putative effectors can be annotated by PHI database (Supplementary Table S11), and most of the annotated effectors have been implicated in fungal pathogenesis. Functional analysis of putative C. sojina effectors. (A) Phylogenetic analysis of putative effectors. The phylogenetic tree of 233 putative effectors is categorized into six super clades.

Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT–PCR) were used to determine gene expression levels. Values are mean ± SD (n = 3 biological replicates).Next, we attempt to investigate the effector function. Pro-apoptotic mouse protein BAX-induced programmed cell death (PCD) on N. benthamiana could physiologically resemble defence-associated hypersensitive response caused by pathogens, providing a valuable screening approach for effectors that can suppress defence-related PCD.67 We randomly selected 50 effectors and transiently expressed them in N. benthamiana to screen the potential effectors that can suppress BAX-triggered PCD (BT-PCD). Our results show that about 1/4 (13/50) selected effectors strongly suppress BT-PCD (Fig. 7B). Moreover, qRT-PCR results show that most of these putative effectors are transcriptionally induced at 48 h after C. sojina infection (Fig. 7C), implying they probably contribute to early infection on soybean.4. DiscussionCercospora species cause severe leaf spot and blight diseases on many crops worldwide.1 In this study, we sequenced the genome of the economically important fungi, C. sojina race 1. The genome size is ~40.84 Mb, and 25.56% of the genome is composed of repeat sequences. However, compared with the genome size of sequenced but not annotated C. sojina isolate using NGS method (IMG genome id: 2506520004, https://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/m/main.cgi), C. sojina race 1 has a larger genome size (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S12). In particular, the assembled C. sojina genome by SMRT generates ~10 Mb repetitive sequences that are not detected by other sequencing techniques.DNA methylation is an important research area of epigenetics in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic. The most studied type of DNA methylation in fungi is m5C, while in prokaryotic it is m4C and m6A.68 Until recently, the methylase and demethylase for m6A in eukaryotic were identified. However, in fungi, this type of DNA modification is poorly studied. Using SMRT, we identified m6A and m4C in C. sojina for the first time, in which we found 17,407 m6A and 1,015,733 m4C in C. sojina genome (Fig. 2B). The m6A frequency in this fungus is 435.2/Mb, which is slightly more than 341.3/Mb in yeast.69 In bacteria, m6A is regarded as an epigenetic signal for DNA-protein interactions.70 Surprisingly, we also observe that C. sojina contains large numbers of m4C, which is only reported in bacteria to our knowledge.68 Interestingly, the m4C modification occurs with lower frequency in the region of repetitive elements in C. sojina genome (Fig. 2C and D), indicating that m4C may be involved in the transposition of the transposons. Our results also demonstrate that SMRT is a powerful tool in studying fungal genome epigenetic modification.It is worth noting that one of the enriched family is glycoside hydroxylate GH109 family (Fig. 6). This gene family encodes a-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (aNAGAL), an enzyme that can cleave N-acetyl galactosamine from the conjugated proteins.62 Interestingly, it has been found that lectin can specifically bind N-acetyl galactosamine.62 It is also found that soybean lectin can bind the N-acetyl galactosamine, a component of fungal cell wall.63 Therefore, the aNAGAL may compete with soybean lectin to bind N-acetyl galactosamine. It is known that soybean lectin and other plant lectins can inhibit hyphae growth and spore germination by binding their cell wall components in several fungi, such as Penicillia and Aspergilli species.71,72 We hypothesize that the expansion of GH109 family in C. sojina genome may contribute to overcome the lectin-mediated disease resistance in soybean.CBMs are the most common non-catalytic modules associated with enzymes active in plant cell-wall hydrolysis.73 They can increase enzyme efficiency by anchoring the enzyme’s catalytic region to insoluble cellulose.74 However, only one CBM1 protein was found in C. sojina genome (Supplementary Table S9). In light of their relative slower infection process, the deficiency of CBMs in the genome may undermine C. sojina infection in terms of digesting plant cell walls.It is believed that mycotoxin plays a critical role during pathogen infection.75 Mycotoxin cercosporin produced by Cercospora spp. is considered to be one of the key factors that can enhance their virulence, as their pathogenicity was remarkably impaired in the cercosporin-deficient mutants.75 However, C. sojina is one of the few Cercospora spp. that was reported not able to produce cercosporin, although there is a dispute.9 We made an effort to examine the cercosporin in either cultured mycelium or infected plant tissue. However, we are unable to detect cercosporin in any of the samples although the complete gene cluster for cercosporin biosynthesis exists in C. sojina genome (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S8). Therefore, our data imply that C. sojina may not employ cercosporin but other mycotoxin to enhance virulence.Fungi-derived pigments can act as virulence factors to facilitate infection in plants, and are required for pathogen fitness by serving as UV protectants and ROS scavengers.59 The well-studied fungal pigment is melanin, which essentially contributes to fungal pathogenesis by altering cytokine responses, decreasing phagocytosis and scavenging ROS, as well as playing an important role in reinforcing fungal cell wall.76 Similar as melanin, we observed some pigment production was induced by cAMP or starvation treatments (Fig. 5B). We also identified the key gene clusters that encode PKS in C. sojina genome (Fig. 5A and Table S7). Moreover, the whole genome transcriptome assays also demonstrate that the key genes that are involved in pigment biosynthesis are significantly up-regulated. These data further support the assumption that the pigments produced by C. sojina are involved in its virulence.In addition to secondary metabolites, pathogens usually harbour various virulence effectors. These effectors interfere with host immune responses to enhance virulence. For example, bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae delivers over 30 effectors by type III secretion system during infection.77 Our work showed that more than one third of the effectors were upregulated during starvation (Supplementary Fig. S7B), and many of them can suppress BAX-induced cell death (Fig. 7B), similar to the finding in Phytophothora sojae.67 These data demonstrate that C. sojina can probably deploy effectors to promote infection.In summary, we report a complete genome sequence of C. sojina by SMRT sequencing method. This sequencing method not only assists us to find the repetitive elements, but also to discover the DNA methylations in fungus. By the genome assembly and annotation, we hypothesize that the specific CAZymes, secondary metabolites, and effectors can help C. sojina to adapt to soybean successfully. Our work also lays the groundwork for future discoveries on this important soybean disease.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.Authors’ contributionsJ.L. and S.M. conceived the research plans; X.L., J.C., and J.H. performed the experiments; Z.W., Z.G., and Y.C. provided technical assistance; X.L., J.C., and J.L. wrote the article.FundingThe study was supported by Chinese Academy of Sciences (Strategic Priority Research Program Grant NO.

Gaertn) is an important crop for food security because of its tolerance to drought, which is expected to be exacerbated by global climate changes. Nevertheless, it is often classified as an orphan/underutilized crop because of the paucity of scientific attention.

Gaertn) is the coarse cereal that is most widely cultivated in dry regions under rain-fed conditions. Finger millet is an allotetraploid (2n = 4× = 36) with an AABB genome that belongs to the family Poaceae and subfamily Chloridoideae. It was domesticated from the wild allotetraploid E. africana in Uganda to Ethiopia more than 5000 years ago. It is widely accepted that the A genome progenitor is the wild diploid species E. indica (2n = 2× = 18) or one of its close relatives, including E. tristachya, while the B genome progenitor is unknown or most likely extinct.1,2,3,4 Finger millet is one of the richest sources of mineral elements such as calcium, iron, manganese, and zinc, in addition to being a fairly good source of vitamins and several essential amino acids.5 Among all millets, finger millet is often considered as the best source of lysine.6 With its high satiety value and low glycemic index, finger millet has excellent potential as a nutraceutical cereal. It is grown widely, including in India, many African countries, China, and, historically until the present day, even in Japan.7Despite its importance, very little research emphasis has been given to finger millet; hence, this species is classified as an orphan or underutilized crop.7,8 The major reasons for this classification include a distant relationship to any of the major cereals, a large genome size, and particularly, its tetraploidy. Thus, limited efforts have been made toward the generation of genomic resources for this species, including sequencing of its genome. The genome size of finger millet was estimated to be 3.34–3.87 pg (2C),7,9 which corresponds to 1.63–1.89 Gb in haploid (1C) cells assuming that 1 pg DNA corresponds to 978 Mbp with a GC content of 50%. Several attempts have also been made to prospect novel genes linked to the drought-stress acclimation response,10–13 and a small number of SSR markers for the construction of genetic linkage maps have been reported.14 The EcNAC1 gene of E. coracana, which encodes a NAC family transcriptional factor, was shown to be induced by drought and to confer resistance to drought and other stresses when expressed in tobacco.10 However, compared with the progress made in generating genomic information in sorghum and pearl millet, efforts in finger millet remain scarce. The absence of such genomic resources has been the major impediment in improving finger millet through the adoption of molecular breeding approaches.The genome assembly and annotation of polyploid species has been a major challenge in genomics, because homeologous genes (i.e. duplicated genes derived from genome duplication) are by definition highly similar and their separate assembly is difficult. About 35% of vascular plants are estimated to be recent polyploids,15,16 and it has long been known that important crop species are polyploids.17 However, the genome assemblies of only a handful of polyploid species have been reported. More importantly, the quality of the polyploid assembly, in particular the scaffold length, tends to be low in such reports. The presence of duplicated genes and polyploidy split the assembly, thus leading to shorter scaffolds and contigs.18,19Some polyploid species have, however, been assembled; e.g. Nicotiana tabacum,20,Gossypium hirsutum,21,Triticum aestivum,22 and Brassica juncea.23 The genome assembly of hexaploid wheat, Triticum aestivum (TGACv1),22 was performed via chromosome separation, albeit with an N50 of several kb.22 A combined approach of PacBio long reads and Bionano Genomics optical genome mapping succeeded in assembling the genome of Brassica juncea, which is an allotetraploid, with an N50 scaffold that was 1.5 Mb long.23 Subsequently, pseudochromosomes were constructed using the diploid genome and genetic linkage maps. However, in previous polyploid assemblies, little was reported on the validation of the separation of homeologs in cases with unknown parental species. Another potential assembly strategy that can be used when all the parental species are known is the assembly of the genome sequences based on the parental diploid species. This was employed for the allotetraploid Arabidopsis kamchatica using the two parental species A. halleri and A. lyrata;24,25 however, this cannot be simply applied to finger millet because one of the parental species is unknown. Recently, the rubber tree genome was assembled using Dovetail Chicago method26 (Dovetail Genomics, LLC, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) with a scaffold N50 of 96.8 kb, and they revealed the paleotetraploidy of the genome. The Chicago library is a longer range technique than mate-pair library, which is based on chromosome conformation capture sequencing (Hi-C) protocol.27 The barley genome was assembled in chromosome length scale with Hi-C library.28 NRGene Ltd (Ness-Ziona, Israel) has succeeded recently in assembling some crop genomes, e.g. the genome of maize with a very high scaffold N50 of 35.5 Mb, using the DeNovoMAGICTM software (http://nrgene.com/products-technology/denovomagic/).29 They require some PCR-free paired-end libraries and mate-pair libraries for the DeNovoMAGICTM, but the company has not reported its algorithm and strategy in detail.Here, we report the whole-genome draft sequencing and assembly of a tetraploid finger millet, cultivar PR202 (IC: 479099), using a novel polyploid genome assembly workflow. This cultivar was chosen for this work considering the extent of its adaptability. A selection from the Godavari regions of Southern India was chosen for this study based on its resilience to drought and high-temperature stresses. This cultivar is being used as the national check in all of the multilocation yield-evaluation trials performed by the All India Coordinated Small Millets Improvement Project (AICSMIP) (http://millets.res.in/aicrp_small.php).302. Materials and methodsSeeds of finger millet (variety name, PR202; IC number, 479099; the IC number is the indigenous collection number issued by the National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources, India) that were stocked at the Project Coordinating Unit (Small Millets), University of Agricultural Sciences, GKVK, Bangalore, India) were used for germination. DNA was extracted from young leaves of finger millet plants grown in a plant chamber at 20 °C to 22 °C, 3 weeks later for sequencing and 2 months later for genome scanning. In this section, the methods used for DNA and RNA isolation and preparation of libraries for sequencing are described.2.1. Preparation of DNA libraries for sequencingGood-quality and high-molecular-weight genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated using a combination of CTAB and Genomic tip 500/G column (Qiagen AG, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) purification method, in accordance with the protocol ‘Preparing Arabidopsis Genomic DNA for Size-Selected ~20 kb SMRTbell™ Libraries’ (http://www.pacb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Shared-Protocol-Preparing-Arabidopsis-DNA-for-20-kb-SMRTbell-Libraries.pdf). The DNA pellet obtained using the conventional CTAB method was dissolved in 1 ml of Dnase- and RNase-free distilled water (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and purified by passing through Genomic tip 500/G columns, to obtain intact DNA with a size above 60 kb. For library preparation, the TruSeq DNA NanoSample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used in the following steps. DNA samples (1 µg) were sonicated on a Covaris instrument (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA) using settings specific for a fragment size of 550 bp. The fragmented DNA samples were size selected using AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA), end-repaired, and polyadenylated. TruSeq adapters containing the index for multiplexing were ligated to the fragmented DNA samples. Fragments containing TruSeq adapters at both ends were selectively enriched by PCR. The quality and quantity of the enriched libraries were validated using Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies) and TapeStation system (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). The products were a smear with an average fragment size of approximately 700 bp. The libraries were normalized to 10 nM in Tris-HCl 10 mM, pH 8.5 with 0.1% Tween 20. The 3–8 and 20 kb mate-pair libraries were prepared according to Lucigen’s NxSeq® Long Mate Pair Kit protocol and NxSeq® 20 kb Mate Pair Library kit protocol (Lucigen Corporation, Middleton, WI, USA), respectively. Briefly, genomic DNA was sheared using Covaris G-TUBES (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA) to the desired size (3, 5, 8, and 20 kb), end-repaired, A-tailed, and ligated to adaptors. The insert was size selected and ligated to a unique coupler that contained encrypted Chimera Code™ sequences. The circularized inserts were treated with exonuclease for the removal of unwanted linear DNA and digested with a selection of endonucleases to produce correctly sized di-tags (400–900 bp). Biotin capture was used to remove unwanted DNA fragments prior to the addition of the Junction Code™ Reagent. The library was recircularized and PCR amplified and the quality was assessed using a Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies), and the TapeStation system (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). The final mate-pair libraries were normalized to 10 nM in Tris–HCl 10 mM, pH 8.5 with 0.1% Tween 20.2.2. Preparation of RNA libraries for sequencingRNA was extracted from young leaves of finger millet 1 month after germination. Freshly germinated finger millet plants were exposed to drought stress, in which the plants were not watered for 7 days. Tissue samples were taken from the young leaves before and after the exposure to drought conditions. RNA was extracted using an RNeasy plant kit (Qiagen AG, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland). The quantity and quality of the isolated RNA was determined using a Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies) and a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Waldbronn). For library preparation, TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) was used in the subsequent steps. Briefly, total RNA samples (1 µg) were ribosome depleted and then reverse transcribed into double-stranded cDNAs, with addition of actinomycin during first-strand synthesis. The cDNA samples were fragmented, end-repaired, and polyadenylated before the ligation of TruSeq adapters. The adapters contained the index for multiplexing. Fragments containing TruSeq adapters at both ends were selectively enriched with PCR. The quality and quantity of the enriched libraries were assessed using a Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer and a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Waldbronn). Products were a smear with an average fragment size of ~360 bp. The libraries were normalized to 10 nM in Tris-HCl 10 mM, pH 8.5 with 0.1% Tween 20.2.3. Library preparation and sequencing for PacBio RS IIThe SMRT Bell library was produced using a DNA Template Prep Kit 1.0 (PacBio p/n 100-259-100). The concentration of the input gDNA was measured using a Qubit Fluorometer dsDNA Broad Range assay (Life Technologies p/n 32850). gDNA (10 µg) was mechanically sheared to an average size distribution of 10 kb using a Covaris gTube (Kbiosciences p/n 520079). A Bioanalyzer 2100 12K DNA Chip assay (Agilent p/n 5067-1508) was used to assess the fragment size distribution. Sheared gDNA (5 µg) was DNA-damage repaired and end-repaired using polishing enzymes. A blunt-end ligation reaction followed by exonuclease treatment was performed to create the SMRT Bell template. A Blue Pippin device (Sage Science, Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) was used to size select the SMRT Bell template and enrich for large fragments (>10 kbp). The size-selected library was quality inspected and quantified on Agilent Bioanalyzer 12 kb DNA Chip and Qubit Fluorimeter (Life Technologies). A ready-to-sequence SMRT Bell-Polymerase Complex was created using a P6 DNA/Polymerase Binding Kit 2.0 (PacBio p/n 100-236-500), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The PacBio RS II instrument was programmed to load and sequence the sample on PacBio SMRT cells v3.0 (PacBio p/n 100-171-800), acquiring one movie of 360 min per SMRT cell. A MagBead loading (PacBio p/n 100-133-600) method was chosen to improve the enrichment of the longer fragments. After the run, a sequencing report was generated for each cell via the SMRT portal, to assess adapter dimer contamination, sample-loading efficiency, average read length, and number of filtered sub-reads.2.4. Next-generation optical mappingA Bionano Prep™ Plant Tissue DNA Isolation Kit was used according to the Bionano Prep™ Plant Tissue DNA Isolation Base Protocol (Document number: 30068, Document revision: B, Bionano Genomics, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Briefly, 1 g of young leaves collected 2 months after germination was fixed in formaldehyde, to protect the nuclei and DNA against mechanical shearing. The leaves were then homogenized with a rotor-stator apparatus, to break the tough plant cell wall, followed by a density gradient purification for the recovery of intact nuclei. These samples were embedded in low-melt agarose plugs for proteinase K (Qiagen AG, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) and RNase A (Qiagen AG, Hombrechtikon) digestion and subsequent purification of high-molecular-weight (HMW) DNA. The resulting HMW DNA was processed further according to the IrysPrep™ Labeling-NLRS User Guide (Document number: 30024, Document revision: G, Bionano Genomics) using an NLRS Kit (Bionano Genomics). In brief, 300 ng of HMW DNA was nicked by Nt.BspQI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and labeled. These reactions provided sequence specificity for an optimal label density of 8–15 labels per 100 kbp. The nick enzyme Nt.BspQI was selected by predicting the label density as 11.9 labels per 100 kbp using Bionano Genomics Knickers (ver. 1.5.5.0, http://www.bnxinstall.com/knickers/Knickers.htm) beforehand. The labeled nicks were repaired to restore strand integrity, and the labeled DNA was stained for backbone visualization. Labeled nicks were subsequently detected as dots on a string when run on a Bionano Irys® system instrument.2.5. Sequencing and optical mappingSequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq500, MiSeq instrument (Illumina) and a PacBio RS II system (Pacific Bioscience of California, Inc., CA, USA). Genome optical mapping was carried out on a Bionano Irys® system (Bionano Genomics). The three paired-end libraries with insertion lengths of 250, 550, and 700 bases were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 apparatus (reagent version 2 kits 2 × 150 cycles). In contrast, the four mate-pair libraries with insert sizes of 3, 5, 8, and 20 kb were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument (reagent version 3 kits 2 × 300 cycles). Long reads were obtained from PacBio RS II using a total of 23 SMRT cells. The nicked-labeled HMW DNA was run on a Bionano IrysChip® flowcell that scanned 6 times for 96.5× coverage.2.6. Genome size estimationApproximately 0.5 cm2 of fresh leaf tissue of finger millet, together with an equal amount of leaf tissue of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum; used as an internal standard [diploid genome size, 1.96 pg31]), was chopped with a sharp razor blade in extraction buffer (CyStain PI Absolut P; Sysmex Europe GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany). The suspension of nuclei was filtrated and incubated in staining solution containing propidium iodide (PI) and RNase A (CyStain PI Absolut P; Sysmex). The suspension of stained nuclei was analyzed using a flow cytometer (CyFlow Space, Sysmex).2.7. Hybrid de novo assembly workflow and gene annotationThe hybrid de novo assembly workflow is shown in Fig. 1. Adapters that contaminated the sequenced paired-end reads and low-quality bases were trimmed using Trimmomatic (ver. 0.33)32 on the SUSHI framework33 after sequencing. Regarding the mate-pair libraries, first, chimera reads were filtered out, and chimera code and linker sequences from the 5' end were trimmed using the script IlluminaChimera-Clean5.py provided by Lucigen Co., Wisconsin, USA, followed by another script, IlluminaNxSeqJunction-Split9.py, to segregate the reads into proper mate-pair reads and unsplit reads via the detection of junction sequences. Subsequently, Platanus (ver. 1.2.4)34 was executed using the preprocessed paired-end reads to assemble contigs (Fig. 1, step 1), which were then used as anchors to connect the PacBio long reads on DBG2OLC (commit id: 7f1712ae76b015b1f4efee81a5d4e1305701197a)35 (Fig. 1, step 2). Contigs from the Platanus assembly that were longer than 1 kb were used for the input of the DBG2OLC hybrid assembly. Note that many short contigs were filtered out to adopt a conservative approach aimed at avoiding misassembly, as short and fragmented contigs stemmed most probably from complex regions, such as repeats and duplicates. The contigs from the DBG2OLC hybrid assembly were polished using Pilon (ver. 1.21)36 with the accurate Illumina short reads, to correct misassemblies (NGS contigs) (Fig. 1, step 3). We used only half amount of the paired-end reads (250 base insert size) for the polishing. Subsequently, the polished contigs were scaffolded with the mate-pairs using SSPACE standard (ver. 3.0)37 (NGS scaffolds) (Fig. 1, step 4-1). We only used the proper mate-pair reads for scaffolding. Independently, optical genome mapping was performed on a Bionano Irys® system (Fig. 1, step 4-2), followed by de novo assembly with the detected molecules using the IrysView® and Bionano IrysSolve® software (ver. 2.1) (BNG contigs) (Fig. 1, step 5). The de novo assembly was performed twice: the first de novo assembly used the estimated nose parameters by mapping the detected molecules to the NGS contigs, and the second assembly used autonoise (autodetection of appropriate noise parameters). The hybrid scaffolding was performed using Bionano IrysSolve® (ver. 2.1) with both the NGS scaffolds and the BNG contigs. Finally, GMclose (ver. 1.6)38 filled the gaps in the super-scaffolds using all the contigs assembled by Platanus. The actual executed commands as a shell script with configuration files and parameters are provided in Supplementary File S1. Hybrid de novo assembly workflow. In the figure, the white box represents a process, the gray box represents a data entity, the blue solid arrow shows the process flow, and the black dashed arrow shows the data flow. The hybrid de novo assembly was executed as follows: (1) contig assembly using only paired-end reads (Platanus ver. 1.2.4), (2) hybrid contig assembly using contigs >1 kb from the first step and long reads (DBG2OLC commit id: 7f1712ae76b015b1f4efee81a5d4e1305701197a), (3) polishing of the assembled contig with paired-end reads (Pilon ver. 1.21) (NGS contigs), (4) using the polished contigs in the two subsequent independent steps, (4-1) scaffolding of the polished contigs with mate-pair reads (NGS scaffolds), (4-2) after converting scanned molecules into a CMAP file and optical genome mapping to the NGS contigs, (5) de novo assembly of scanned molecules based on the parameters of the molecular-quality report and autonoise (autodetection of appropriate noise parameters) with the NGS contigs (BNG contigs), (6) hybrid scaffolding with both NGS scaffolds (step 4-1 output) and BNG contigs (step 5 output), and (7) gap closing (GMclose ver. 1.6) of the scaffolds with all the contigs generated in the first step (step 1 output). Finally, the workflow produced the super scaffolds. The raw data preprocesses, such as adapter trimming and removing chimera code from mate-pair reads, are not shown in this workflow.Hybrid de novo assembly workflow.

Finally, the workflow produced the super scaffolds. The raw data preprocesses, such as adapter trimming and removing chimera code from mate-pair reads, are not shown in this workflow.The genes were predicted and annotated using MAKER (ver. 2.31.8)39 based on the rice genome (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica IRGSP-1.0, ENA Assembly: GCA_001433935.1) and the RNAseq data that were obtained from young leaves. The rice cDNAs and RNAseq data for the EST evidence and the rice proteins for the protein homology evidence were used for the MAKER job. To render the GFF file, the input of MAKER, the RNAseq data were mapped to the assembled reference sequences using STAR aligner (ver. 2.5.2b)40 and the GFF annotation file was constructed via transcriptome construction using StringTie (ver. 1.3.3b).41 The rice-specific repeat-making library obtained from Repbase database42 was used for RepeatMasker (ver. 4.0.5).43 The rice model was used for Augustus (ver. 3.2.0)44 gene prediction in the MAKER pipeline. The detail options are written in the Supplementary File S1. For assessing the quality of the genome assembly and annotation, we executed BUSCO (ver. 2.0.1)45 using the published plant universal single-copy orthologs. We also performed an RNAseq data alignment to the final assembled genome using STAR (ver. 2.5.2b)40 and checked the mapping statistics.3. Results and discussionIn this section, we report the genome assembly and discuss the results of its validation.3.1. Sequencing and assembly statisticsUsing the flow cytometry experiment, we estimated that the size of the finger millet genome is 1.5 Gb. In total, short reads amounting to 140× coverage and long reads amounting to 16× coverage were sequenced. We scanned the DNA molecules on a Bionano Irys® system and detected 144,761 Mb molecules in a total of six runs (Supplementary Table S1). Based on the estimated genome size, the sequenced coverage depth for each library is reported in Table 1 (PacBio subreads length distribution and calculated insert size of distribution are shown in Supplementary Figs S1 and S2, respectively). Raw sequence dataThe number of sequenced raw data in each library and the coverage depth based on the genome size, 1.5 Gb as estimated by flow cytometry, are shown.Raw sequence dataThe number of sequenced raw data in each library and the coverage depth based on the genome size, 1.5 Gb as estimated by flow cytometry, are shown.The statistics of each step in the hybrid assembly are shown in Table 2. The total assembled size was 1,188,784,944 bases, which is 78.2% of the genome size estimated by flow cytometry. The hybrid contig assembly by DBG2OLC and the scaffolding by SSPACE enhanced the continuity from the Platanus contig assembly, although the mate-pair sequenced coverage was less than 10×, and the total assembly size decreased compared with the Platanus contig assembly. This could be explained by the low sequencing coverage of the PacBio long reads, rather than the filtering out of the shorter Platanus contigs. At the final hybrid scaffolding and gap closing, the N50 of the final super-scaffolds increased to 2.68 Mb, which is approximately twice as long as the NGS scaffolds. The hybrid scaffolding generated super-scaffolds that concatenated the NGS scaffolds based on the BNG contigs that were assembled from the optical genome mapping. Some conflicts were detected between NGS scaffolds and BNG contigs, which split the conflicting NGS scaffolds into smaller pieces. This had the major advantage of correcting the polyploid genome assembly, as scaffolding with only mate-pair short reads may fail to solve the long-range homeologous complexity and may sometimes lead to mis-scaffolding.46,47Assembly statistics at each assembly stepAssembly statistics at each step are summarized. Contig assembly represents the contigs that were assembled using Platanus with preprocessed paired-end reads. Hybrid assembly represents the contigs that were generated using DBG2OLC with the Platanus contigs (> 1 kb long) and PacBio long reads. Scaffold is the result of the SSPACE standard scaffolding with mate-pair reads, and Hybrid scaffold is the hybrid scaffolding result with both Bionano Genomics de novo assembled contigs and the SSPACE scaffolds, followed by GMclose gap closing.Assembly statistics at each assembly stepAssembly statistics at each step are summarized.

Some assemblers, such as Platanus,34 solve this problem by using multiple k-mer sizes for the construction of the DBG. As another solution for the homeologous complexity, longer reads produced from a single-molecule sequencer combined with the OLC method may be beneficial. However, high-coverage sequencing of long reads may solve and correct the wrongly sequenced bases, albeit at a high cost. The hybrid de novo assembly described in this article, which uses both accurate short reads and inaccurate long reads with a low coverage depth, represents another solution regarding assembly cost and calculation efficiency; moreover, the beneficial feature of long reads can be applied to solve the homeologous complexity encountered during polyploid genome assembly. The classification of reads via homeolog phasing50 based on long reads or the parental diploid genome may improve the polyploid assembly further. In addition, further longer molecule information from such as Bionano Irys® system is very promising, not only for super-scaffolding, but also for solving the long-range homeologous complexity in polyploid genome assembly, as demonstrated by the results reported in this article.3.2. Gene annotation and assembly validationAfter the hybrid assembly, we conducted gene annotation prediction using MAKER and 62,348 genes were predicted. The distribution of Annotation Edit Distance (AED)39 tagged by MAKER is shown in Fig. 2A, in which more than 91% of the annotated genes (57,066 genes among a total of 62,348 genes) show an AED <0.5. This result indicates that the annotation is well supported by the evidence. For the assessment of the quality of the assembly and annotation, the assembled scaffolds and predicted genes were analyzed on BUSCO (Fig. 2B). In the assembled scaffolds (shown in Fig. 2B, ‘genome’), 96.5% of the universal single-copy genes (1,389 genes among a total of 1,440 genes) were identified, supporting the quality of the assembly. Among the 1,389 single-copy genes detected, 606 genes were detected as being complete single-copy genes, 783 genes were found to be duplicates, and 766 of the 783 duplicates were exactly twice found from two different scaffolds. An NCBI BLAST search of the complete single-copy genes (606) that were detected only once in the assembled genome found an additional 556 homologous partial genes with a shorter alignment length (40% of the 1,389 complete single-copy genes detected). This indicates that the majority of the homeologous genes were assembled separately (see section 3.3). In tetraploid species, two copies may be found for each ‘single-copy gene’, although duplicated genes may be gradually lost because of redundancy (called nonfunctionalization or homeolog loss).51,52 Similar results were obtained from the BUSCO analysis of proteins and transcripts (Fig. 2, ‘proteins’ and ‘transcripts’), but the missing and fragmented proportion was increased compared with the ‘genome’ analysis. It is well known that one of the homeologs may not be expressed (or silenced) after polyploidization, because of redundancy; thus, some genes were not annotated and the missing and fragmented proportion increased among transcripts and proteins because of the lack of evidence. Moreover, we searched the predicted proteins in the Pfam database53 and found that 74% of predicted proteins were present in this database (Supplementary Fig. S3). RNAseq data obtained using other tissues and conditions may improve the gene annotation process. Annotation edit distance (AED) and benchmark of universal single-copy orthologs. (A) The distribution of AED tagged as a gene by MAKER. (B) Benchmark result of the plant set of universal single-copy orthologs produced by BUSCO.

Polyploid assembly validation and phylogenetic analysisTo validate the quality of the polyploid assembly, i.e. to determine whether the homeologs were assembled in different scaffolds, we analyzed our assembly data of three genes for which Sanger sequencing data of E. coracana had been already reported. First, we performed an NCBI BLAST (ver. 2.2.31+)54 search of the published low-copy-number marker phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 4 (Pepc4)1 and granule-bound starch synthase I-like (waxy)2 in the assembled scaffolds. The reciprocal BLAST best-hit search with a very low E-value threshold identified exactly two scaffolds with two different completely matching sequences from different clades (the NCBI BLAST search result is shown in Supplementary File S2). Second, we conducted a molecular phylogenetic analysis using MEGA4 (ver. 7.0.26)55 based on the detected low-copy-number homeologs with the published sequences of close relatives1 (Supplementary Fig. S4). As shown in these figures, the homeologs detected were clearly separated in different clusters. This result indicates that, in these gene regions, the homeologs were successfully assembled, regardless of the presence of highly homologous base sequences. Moreover, the trees supported the contention that E. indica is the wild diploid progenitor of the A genome, because one of the homeologs clustered with the sequences of E. indica.Next, we analyzed EcNAC1, which is the best-studied gene of E. coracana related to the drought response.10 NAC is one of the largest families of plant-specific transcription factors and has been shown to be involved in diverse processes, such as growth, development, and abiotic stresses. The EcNAC1 of the E. coracana GPU28 variety was induced by drought stresses and conferred tolerance to various abiotic stresses, such as simulated osmotic stress by polyethylene glycol (PEG) and mannitol and salinity stresses in the overexpression lines of tobacco.10 Based on our assembly of PR202, we found a sequence that was similar to, and clustered with, the EcNAC1 of GPU28, together with another sequence from the Trichy1 variety (GenBank accession ID: KU500625.1) (Supplementary Fig. S5). The assembly also had another copy, which is likely to be a homeolog in a different scaffold. It would be valuable to study this copy, which may well have drought-related functions.In addition, we searched homologous genes as ‘duplicated genes’ in the predicted transcripts using NCBI BLAST and found 57,913 genes that had more than two copies in the genome (Supplementary File S3). Among these duplicates, we found 34,678 genes as reciprocal BLAST best-hit genes located in different scaffolds. Assuming that these genes are homeologs, we found that 56% of all 62,348 genes were considered homeologs, which is consistent with the ratio (55% (766/1389)) of duplicated single-copy genes detected exactly twice in BUSCO (the analytical process and results are shown as a shell script in Supplementary File S3). To check the location of these homeologs, we calculated the gene density (the number of genes per Mb) and the homeolog density (the number of homeologs per Mb) in each scaffold (Supplementary Fig. S6 A1–2, B1–2). Panels A1 and B1 of Supplementary Fig. S6 show the density against the scaffold length of all genes and homeologs, respectively, and panels A2 and B2 show the density distribution of all genes and homeologs, respectively, as well. The genome-wide gene density was 52.4 genes per Mb and the genome-wide homeolog density was 29.2 homeologs per Mb. As shown in these figures, all genes and homeologs were distributed similarly over the genome. Nonetheless, there was a small number of scaffolds (>1 kb long) with high homeolog density (Supplementary Fig. S6, B1), which indicates that there are areas that are dense in homeologs compared with the genome-wide homeolog distribution.3.4. Summary of the assembly of the genome of polyploid finger milletOver half of the world’s freshwater resources are currently being used for irrigating agricultural crops. The domestic and industrial demands of the burgeoning population have led to an unprecedented withdrawal of freshwater.56 Combined with the erratic pattern of rainfall caused by the ensuing global climate change, agriculture production is expected to be severely affected in the years to come.57 This scenario urgently necessitates the cultivation of more water-productive crops and/or the development of improved cultivars with a superior water-use efficiency. Millets, with their C4 photosynthetic metabolism, are generally considered to possess higher levels of drought tolerance and are generally cultivated under rain-fed conditions. Because of their higher resilience to harsh climatic conditions, millets exhibit a wider adaptation, and hence can be cultivated in a wider range of agro-ecosystems. Therefore, millets currently represent an integral component of human diets in most impoverished areas, especially in the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.We assembled the genome of the allotetraploid finger millet (Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn, variety: PR202, IC: 479099) via a novel pipeline using various types of sequencers. The size of the assembled genome was about 1.2 Gb, while the genome size measured by flow cytometry was 1.5 Gb. Considering that the majority of the grass genomes are likely to be composed of repetitive elements, the coverage of the genome is sufficiently high. MAKER predicted 62,348 genes, which is roughly the double of the 35,679 genes identified in diploid rice (Oryza sativa Japonica IRGSP-1.0); this is also consistent with a good coverage of the genome. Three lines of evidence supported the good coverage. First, we provided a polyploid assembly with a long scaffold size (N50 length >2.5 Mb), while the assembly of polyploid genomes tends to be fragmented. It is true that the N50 may not mean correct assembly and scaffolding, but we avoided too-greedy scaffolding. Second, 96.5% of the 1,440 universal single-copy orthologs were identified, and 95.9% of RNAseq reads were mapped to the assembled genome, which supported the adequateness of the assembly. Third, the majority of these universal sets had two copies, suggesting the separation of homeologs was adequate in our assembly strategy. Concomitantly, however, we found a significant number of genes that had a single copy. There are several likely explanations for this finding. (i) One of the duplicated genes tends to be lost because of redundancy. Polyploidization was estimated to have occurred well before the domestication of millet (0.50–2.71 mya), in contrast with other crops, in which polyploidization occurred through domestication during the last thousand years.58,59 Thus, it is possible that many duplicated genes were lost. (ii) The published plant universal single-copy gene set is not collected by random sampling from the entire plant genes in terms of the rate of gene loss. Despite the frequent occurrence of genome duplication events throughout angiosperms, these genes tend to be lost and become single copy, potentially because of dosage balance or redundancy. (iii) The assembly size is less than the genome size estimated by flow cytometry. Most of the lacking sequences are likely to be repetitive sequences, but it is also likely that parts of the genic regions were not assembled. (iv) The assembler could not deal with two homeologs; thus, one copy was missing or two copies were combined. We verified that the two copies of the Pepc4 gene, waxy and NAC, were assembled separately. Currently, not many genome sequences from diploid E. indica are available, preventing the systematic validation of homeologs. Further improvement of assembly algorithms and validation would be valuable in this field of research. It is still possible to improve the assembly and annotation of this genome. Nevertheless, the allotetraploid finger millet genome information reported here is expected to be of much value for further genomic research of this millet at the molecular level, as well as for studies aimed at improving finger millet productivity and bioavailability. We have successfully shown the applicability of the multiple hybrid de novo assembly workflow to a complex allotetraploid genome.Recently, the genome assembly of the E. coracana ML-365 variety was elucidated using Illumina and SOLiD sequencing data.60 We emphasize that our data and analyses were targeted at the analysis of complex polyploid genomes. The N50 of our assembly (>2.5 Mb) was two orders of magnitude higher than that of ML-365 (about 24 kb) and would allow RNAseq analysis of each homeolog separately, as well as resequencing analyses. Our results illustrate the strength of single-molecule sequencing and optical genome mapping in assembling polyploid genomes.We wish to thank Dr. Scott Monsma at Lucigen Co., Wisconsin, USA, for mate-pair library preparation, Carmen Näf at the University of Zurich for RNA extraction and library preparation, Aki Morishima for plant growth and genome size estimation by flow cytometry, Dr. Misako Yamazaki and Dr. Lucas Mohn at the University of Zurich for sample handling, and Dr. Dario Copetti at the University of Arizona for advice on gene annotation, and Dr. Jun Sese and Dr. Tony Kuo at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology for discussion about polyploid genome assembly.

IntroductionEmbryonic lethality has become a challenge to cattle breeders, especially for dairy cattle where a limited number of bulls were extensively used in breeding for fast genetic progress in economic traits like milk and protein yield.1 An estimated yearly loss of ~$10.74 million is attributed to known recessive lethals in four dairy cattle breeds from USA only, where Holstein accounts for ~70% of the total losses, followed by Jersey, Brown Swiss, and Ayrshire.2 Hence, understanding the genomic architecture of cattle populations is important, now more than ever, for optimizing genetic gain while constraining negative impact of deleterious mutations responsible for genetic defects and inbreeding depression.Unlike single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and small insertion or deletion (indel), structural variants (SVs), i.e. DNA alterations larger than 50 base pairs (bp) that include insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations,3 are the least explored polymorphisms in cattle. SVs contribute substantially to phenotypic variations and have a wide-spectrum of impact ranging from beneficial to lethal in both humans3,4 and animals.5 The phenotypic impact of SVs in cattle is well evident from numerous studies. For example, Xu et al.6 showed that a combination of SNPs with SVs could explain additional genetic variance underlying milk production traits, while Charlier et al.,7 Schutz et al.,8 and Kadri et al.,9 showed the lethal effect of large deletions in dairy cattle. Furthermore, a ~525 KB deletion on chromosome 23 is reported to be associated with stillbirth in Nordic Red Cattle.10Earlier SV studies on cattle were mostly SNP-array based, such as array-comparative genomic hybridization,11 50 K BovineSNP50 BeadChip12 or 777 K BovineHD BeadChip (BovineHD chip)13 based. But, using these approaches a substantial portion of the genome could not be explored and breakpoint resolution is still an issue.14 However, whole-genome sequence (WGS) based techniques could improve resolution as well as power to capture SVs in a wide size and frequency spectrum.14 For example, majority of the novel SVs in humans15,16 and mouse17 were detected using WGS approaches. Besides, breakpoint sequences could also be assembled with high accuracy from sequencing reads,18 which are necessary for elucidating the mechanisms underlying SV formation.19In the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, hundreds of cattle (bull or cow) genomes were re-sequenced in collaborative initiative such as 1000 Bull Genomes Project (1KBGP)20 (and other independent projects, e.g.21,22) to build a comprehensive database of sequence variants, mainly SNPs and indels. This NGS data provides a unique opportunity to study SVs in cattle. However, few studies23,24 utilized these (and/or other) NGS resources so far for studying SVs in cattle.Therefore, in this study we scanned the WGSs of 175 cattle from three dairy breeds, namely Holstein, Jersey, and Nordic Red Cattle, to discover large deletions segregating in the population, and analyse their population-genetic properties. In particular, we focused on understating the population diversity, stratification, and plausible functional effects. We also explored the probable mechanisms of SV formation for a set of breakpoint-resolved deletions.2. Materials and methods2.1. Animal samples and ethicsThis study was performed on WGS of 175 dairy cattle from three breeds, e.g. 67 Holstein, 27 Jersey, and 81 Nordic Red Cattle. The sample included 7 Holstein cows and 168 bulls from these three breeds-144 animals from Run 5 of 1KBGP20 and 31 animals from Nordic sequence data.21 Genome sequences were generated using Illumina paired-end sequencing to an average coverage of 10-fold.Here, we did not include any experimentation on animals and only dealt with analysis-ready WGS data; hence, no ethical approval was required.2.2. Sequence alignment to reference genome and SNPs/indels callingRaw sequencing reads were filtered and ‘FASTQ’ files were aligned to bovine reference genome assembly ‘UMD3.1’ using ‘BWA’ software25 to produce BAM files for subsequent variant calling. In 1KBGP, SNPs and indels were called using ‘SAMtools 0.1.18 mpileup’ software,26 while ‘GATK v1.6’ software27 was used for Nordic WGS data (detailed method in20 and,21 respectively). For all the analysis, bovine genome assembly ‘UMD3.1’ was used as the reference genome. 2.3. Discovery and genotyping of deletionsSVs can be detected from NGS data based on sequence signatures such as (discordant) read-pair (RP), split-read (SP), and read-depth (RD), as well as de novo assembly of reads.14 However, approaches based on only one sequence signature could be constrained by high false discovery rate (FDR),28 hence we employed a population scale SV detection method called ‘Genome STRucture in Populations (Genome STRiP)’28—which leverages technical (e.g. RP and RD signals) and population-level sequence features (e.g. coherence around shared alleles, and heterogeneity of evidentiary sequences in different genomes) for accurate discovery of deletions, and determines genotype (allelic state) of each locus from RD using a Gaussian mixture model.For deletion discovery and genotyping ‘Genome STRiP’ software version 2.00.167828 was used. Following the documentation, we built a custom reference metadata bundle for cattle samples that includes alignability mask, copy-number mask (CN2 mask), ploidy map, gender map. Alignability mask represents sites on the reference genome that are uniquely alignable by sequence read of a certain length (readLength). Our WGS data was a mixture of different ‘Illumina’ paired-end reads ranging from 90 to 101 bp (Q1 = 90, median = 100, and Q3 = 100), hence genome alignability mask was prepared with readLength value of 90 using ‘ComputeGenomeMask’ utility from Genome STRiP. Copy-number mask (CN2 mask), i.e. regions on the reference genome unlikely to be copy-number variable in most individuals, was produced for the bovine assembly UMD3.1 excluding sex chromosome X, unplaced contigs, and repeat sequences (retrieved from RepeatMasker track of UCSC Table Browser,29 accessed on 4 July 2016).We ran the preprocessing Queue script (dry run) to emit all the commands, prepared bash scripts to run in Portable Batch System job scheduler, and executed these commands proving 175 BAM files (one for each sample) as input.Large deletions (100 bp = size = 1 MB) were discovered and filtered using SVDiscovery Queue script. Discovered sites were filtered (default filters) if (i) the site contained too high or too low read pileup, (ii) RPs spacing was inconsistent with a single segregating deletion, (iii) RD and RP evidences were inconsistent across samples, (iv) RD differences were not significant, and (v) RP evidence was thinly distributed across samples (Genome STRiP Tutorial—GATK Workshop 2013, http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/genomestrip/workshop-presentations, accessed on 26 August 2016).All passed sites were genotyped by SVGenotyper with default parameters. Genotyped deletion calls were then filtered based on following criteria, e.g. (i) sites with excess number of heterozygote calls (inbreeding coefficient = -0.15), (ii) non-variant site based on genotype likelihood (parameter: non-variance score = 13.0), (iii) sites with too low or too high RD (parameter: 0.5 = GSM1 = 2.0), (iv) sites with less than 30% uniquely alignable bases, (v) potential duplicate of another site (parameter: duplicateOverlapThreshold 0.5 and duplicateScoreThreshold = 0.0), (vi) start/end position of a deletion call within 150 bp of assembly gap, (vii) all samples homozygous for reference allele (95% CI), and (viii) sites with = 10% missing genotype.2.4. Validation of deletionsWe validated deletion calls using 777K BovineHD BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) intensity data on 26 Holstein samples that were both WGS and 777K chip typed. We calculated FDR for the deletion call-set using IntensityRankSum (IRS) test implemented in Genome STRiP. Intensity file was prepared from raw chip intensity data following the guideline for IRS test. Overall FDR for the call-set was calculated as two times the fraction of sites with IRS P-value = 0.5 (i.e. sites with IRS P-value = 0.5 to the sites with valid P-value). Details of IRS test could be found in.15,28Targeted iterative graph routing assembler (TIGRA-0.4.3) software18 was used, with default parameters, for assembling deletion breakpoint sequences from a set of randomly selected deletions along with three previously known deletions segregating in the study populations. TIGRA extracted all reads mapped to 500 bp upstream and 50 bp downstream of start coordinate, and 50 bp upstream and 500 bp downstream of end coordinate of a given deletion; and reads were then assembled iteratively using de Bruijn graph assembler with multiple k-mers (e.g. 15 bp followed by 25 bp). We aligned the assembled contigs to UMD3.1 using Cow BLAT Search30 from UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat) to visualize and infer breakpoints from the alignments.We validated a previously reported ~525 KB deletion segregating in Nordic Red Cattle10 using PCR and amplicon sequencing. Genomic DNA was extracted as described previously by Miller et al.31 from semen sample of two bulls carrying the deletion and two non-carriers. The PCR reaction was done with the DyNAzyme II DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher, MA, US) in a 30 µl volume of 1× PCR buffer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 10 pmol primer mix (forward primer: 5'- AAGCCACCACAATGAGAAGC -3' and reverse primer: 5'- TTTGGGGTAGGAGAAGTAGGG -3') and 50 ng of genomic DNA. The cycling conditions were the following: (i) an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, (ii) 35 cycles of 30 s denaturation (94 °C), 30 s hybridization (65.2 °C), 30 s elongation (72 °C), and a final 3 min elongation (72 °C). PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel, purified and directly sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, CA, US). Electrophoresis of sequencing reactions was performed on ‘3500xL Genetic Analyzers’ (Applied Biosystems, CA, US), and sequences were visualized with Sequencher 5.4.6 (Gene Codes Corporation, MI, USA). A 977 bp control amplification, with a primer pair within the deletion (forward primer: 5'- CCCAATGCAAAATCACAAAA -3' and reverse primer: 5'- CCAGAAAAGCTACACTTGAACTGA -3'), was performed using the same reaction conditions as above except hybridization was performed at 59.8 °C.2.5. Analysis of population genetic propertiesThe population genetic properties of deletions, among the three breeds, were studied in terms of population diversity, population structure, and population differentiation. Population diversity was calculated using ‘VariantsPerSampleAnnotator’ from ‘Genome STRiP’ software, which provides distribution of variants across samples and populations. We performed principal component analysis (PCA) using PLINK (v1.90p) software32 to distinguish three cattle breeds (details in Supplementary Material). We calculated VST33—a population stratification measure of SVs (highly correlated with Wright’s fixation index, FST34), for each deletion locus using variant allele frequency (VAF) and genotypes from pairwise comparison of one breed with the rest, such as Holstein vs Jersey + Nordic Red Cattle, and vice versa.2.6. Functional annotation and enrichment analysisFunctional annotation of deletions were performed using ‘Variant Effect Predictor (VEP-87)’ software,35 and enrichment of protein domains (InterPro36 and Pfam37) and pathways (KEGG38) were analysed using ‘STRING-v10 database’.39Selective constraints on genes were measured from the ratio of non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitution rate, i.e. dN/dS ratio, between cow-mouse 1-to-1 orthologues downloaded from Ensembl database40 (release 87, last accessed on 21 February 2017) using BioMart.41 Here we analysed whether dN/dS of genes overlapping deletions are higher (i.e. less constrained) than that of mouse lethal genes (from Dickinson et al.42) using Wilcoxson test. Reported causal genes for cattle were also retrieved from OMIA database (http://omia.angis.org.au/, last accessed on 10 May 2016) for dN/dS comparison.We retrieved cattle quantitative trait loci (QTL) from QTLdb database43 (release 31; accessed on 6 January 2017); autosomal QTL from Holstein, Jersey, Nordic Red Cattle and Ayrshire, associated to any of the six trait classes, e.g. ‘Reproduction’, ‘Milk’, ‘Production’, ‘Exterior’, ‘Meat and Carcass’, and ‘Health’, were considered for QTL enrichment analysis. We calculated fold enrichment for a trait, such as for Health related QTL: (No. of Health QTL on Deletions / Total QTL on deletions) / (Total Health QTL / Total QTL in the dataset), and statistical significance using ‘Fisher’s exact test’ (two sided).2.7. Data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysisAll statistical analyses and plots were generated in RStudio software44 running R software version 3.3.2,45 unless mentioned otherwise. BEDTools (v2.26.0) software46 is used for identifying the overlap between deletion calls and other genomic features, such as, ‘UMD3.1’ assembly gaps (from ‘UCSC Table Browser’), CNVs from dbVar database47, three known deletions from7,9,10, QTL from QTLdb. VCFtools (v0.1.15) software and PLINK (v1.90p) software were used for analysing the VCF file.3. Results and discussion3.1. Discovery and genotyping of deletionsDeletion discovery and genotyping were carried out using Genome STRiP. After filtering, we report 8,480 large deletions with genotypes in 67 Holsten, 27 Jersey, and 81 Nordic Red Cattle. The deletion size ranged from 199 bp to 773 KB with a mean of 4.5 KB (median = 1 KB), which is approximately 10 times smaller compared with 184 deletion-CNVs (mean = 44.5 KB, median = 7.7 KB) reported in a recent 777K BovineHD BeadChip (BovineHD chip) based study,13 reflecting the resolution of our sequence-based calls. Only 18% of the deletion calls have overlap (=1 bp) with previously reported bovine deletions (or CNV-loss) in the dbVar database (accessed on 27 January 2017), while remaining 82% are novel. However, ~72% of our deletion regions remained unique when compared with all CNVs (gain or loss) and copy number variable regions in the database. Interestingly, majority (~80%) of these overlapping regions are from an earlier WGS-based study, where genome sequences of 27 Holstein, 17 Montbéliarde, and 18 Normande bulls were analysed.23 Nonetheless, we were able to broaden the accessible deletion size-range, more importantly towards smaller one unascertainable by usual SNP-array based approaches. We also report high quality genotypes for all the 8,480 deletions. Apparently, there are more low frequency variants than that of high frequency one, and the frequency distribution is very similar to humans16 (Fig. 1). Number of ascertained deletions relative to variant allele count. Here, VAF is expressed in terms of variant allele count. Deletions down to an allele count of 1 (VAF = 0.0026 and 0.0032, in cattle and humans, respectively) are also represented here.

It is known from human studies that majority of the (bi-allelic) common SVs segregate on specific SNP haplotypes,48,49 which could be imputed with high accuracy.28,50 Thus, this approach has the potential, albeit with large reference, for accurate haplotype phasing and imputation of SVs to large cohorts of low-density chip-typed animals with no additional cost.3.2. Validation of deletionsWe validated the results using three approaches: (i) using BovineHD chip intensity data, (ii) breakpoint assembly and alignment, and (iii) PCR + sequencing of amplicons.We used 777K BovineHD chip intensity data of 26 Holstein animals, both chip-typed and sequenced, to validate the deletion calls using Genome STRiP’ IRS test. We had partial power to investigate all deletions due to the sparsity of the array-probes (one probe per ~3.5 KB), and were underpowered to accurately verify small deletions (e.g. overlapping one-probe). Furthermore, we could only test a deletion for which at least one of the 26 samples had non-reference allele. Therefore, an estimate of FDR for the deletion call-set is provided here from the overall P-value distribution. In this approach, we were able to interrogate ~8.3% of the total call, majority of which contain a single array-probe within the region (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). We found that deletions overlapping only one array-probe had higher FDR (11.3%) compared with two or more probes. And finally, we showed that our deletion call-set had an overall FDR of 8.8%, which is within our chosen threshold of FDR = 10%. FDR estimates of Genome STRiP’ deletion calls using 777K BovineHD BeadChip intensity dataaA, No. of sites with P-value.bB, No. of sites with P-value = 0.5cFDR estimates were based on ‘Wilcoxson rank sum test’ using BovineHD chip intensity data of 26 Holstein animals. FDR was calculated as (B/A × 2 × 100).FDR estimates of Genome STRiP’ deletion calls using 777K BovineHD BeadChip intensity dataaA, No. of sites with P-value.bB, No. of sites with P-value = 0.5cFDR estimates were based on ‘Wilcoxson rank sum test’ using BovineHD chip intensity data of 26 Holstein animals. FDR was calculated as (B/A × 2 × 100).We next validated three randomly chosen set of ten-deletions each by assembling breakpoint sequences using TIGRA18: 10 deletions = 500 bp, 10 deletions > 500 bp but = 1 KB, and 10 deletions with VAF = 0.10. Out of the thirty, we successfully resolved breakpoints of 26 deletions (~87% success rate) using a combination of TIGRA and BLAT search30 (Supplementary Table S2). Additionally, we assembled breakpoints of three previously reported deletions that were also segregating in our study populations, such as a ~662 KB deletion on chromosome 12 encompassing RNASEH2B, GUCY1B2, and FAM124A, a ~3 KB deletion on chromosome 21 encompassing FANCI, and a ~525 KB deletion on chromosome 23 encompassing BTBD9, GLO1, and DNAH8. Breakpoints of the former two deletions were previously reported in,7,9 which exactly matched with our predicted breakpoint sequences (Supplementary Figs S1a–c and S2a–c). Although for the later, we resolved breakpoint sequences in this study (Fig. 2a and b). Overall, the success rate of our deletion-breakpoint assembly was better than the reported success rate of TIGRA on similar sized read-length.18 And Genome STRiP’s breakpoint predictions were on average within 20 bp of the validated breakpoint, which is within the tool’s reported estimate of 1–20 bp.28A ~525-KB deletion on chromosome 23 discovered using Genome STRiP (a), and resolved breakpoint sequences from TIGRA and BLAT search (b).

The breakpoint spanning PCR products of 359 bp were only observed in the carrier animals, while no amplicon was seen for non-carriers (Fig. 3a). The 359 bp amplicon was then sequenced, and exact breakpoint sequences were observed (Fig. 3b), thus confirming the breakpoint for this deletion.

Population genetic properties of deletionsWe explored population diversity among the three dairy cattle breeds from per-individual deletion-heterozygosity and homozygosity. We found that individuals from Nordic Red Cattle exhibits 3.5 and 6.4% higher deletion-heterozygosity than in Holstein and Jersey, respectively. Median numbers of heterozygote-deletion were 1,272, 1,229 and 1,196, in Nordic Red Cattle, Holstein, and Jersey, respectively (Fig. 4a). In contrast to heterozygosity, Jersey animals showed highest levels of deletion-homozygosity, followed by Holstein (Fig. 4b). Similar estimates of genetic diversity were also reported for these breeds in a SNP heterozygosity and runs-of-homozygosity analysis—where Jersey exhibited lowest (genome-wide) average nucleotide diversity (and higher number/size of runs-of-homozygosity) followed by Holstein and Nordic Red Cattle.51 These differences could be understood from the current effective population size (Ne) of these breeds, e.g. Ne of Jersey, Holstein, and Nordic Red Cattle are 73, 99, and 106, respectively52; this entailed higher diversity in Nordic Red Cattle, and Holstein, than in Jersey. From singletons estimate it is also evident that Nordic Red Cattle has more rare deletions compared with Holstein and Jersey (Fig. 4c); partly could be due to incorrect ascertainment of rare ones.

HOL, Holstein; JER, Jersey; RDC, Nordic Red Cattle.We performed PCA using the deletion genotypes of the samples. Around 6 K deletions with VAF between 0.02 and 0.90 were used in the analysis. For comparison, we also performed PCA on ~168 K bi-allelic SNPs randomly selected from 29 autosomes of the same individuals. The first two principal components (PCs) from both deletion and SNP-based PCA clearly distinguished the three breeds, and jointly explained 20 and 16.2% of the variance, respectively (Fig. 5a and b). In addition, PC3 and PC4 recapitulated substructures within Nordic Red cattle (Supplementary Fig. S3), and first five PCs cumulatively explained 33.6% (with the deletions) and 28.4% (with the SNPs) of the variance (Supplementary Fig. S4). Our deletion results agree with the known population structure of the three breeds. Similar population structure (and substructure within Nordic Red Cattle) has been reported using genome-wide SNPs.53 Nordic Red Cattle from Denmark showed closer relationship with the Holstein in our WGS samples (Supplementary Fig. S5). This is consistent with the known history of Holstein interrogation in Danish Red cattle, as previously reported based on imputed WGS SNP analysis on a larger sample.53 It is also known from admixture analysis that genomes of Nordic Red Cattle are a mosaic of multiple ancestral populations, i.e. more ancestral components in Nordic Red Cattle than in Holstein and Jersey52,54; our deletion-based PCA largely corroborate that.

HOL, Holstein; JER, Jersey; RDC, Nordic Red Cattle.We analysed population stratification in terms of VST,33 a measure highly correlated with Wright’s fixation index (FST),34 to identify population differentiation. We calculated VST for each deletion pairwise amongst the breeds (e.g. Holstein vs Jersey + Nordic Red Cattle) from VAFs. We identified 158 highly stratified deletions (pairwise VST = mean + 4 s.d.) among the breeds (Fig. 6). Around 27% of these deletions overlap genic elements, i.e. exons, introns, or (upstream/downstream) untranslated regions (UTRs), and remaining 73% are intergenic variants (Supplementary Tables S3–S5). There were eleven sites shared between Holstein and Nordic Red Cattle, two sites between Holstein and Jersey, and one site between Nordic Red Cattle and Jersey. Among these sites were gene variants, such as ABCA12 (Chr2:103,682,772-103,684,297 in Holstein & Jersey) associated with growth and development,55,56,TTC1 (Chr7:73,725,513-73,725,918 in Holstein & Nordic Red Cattle) with cold tolerance,57,VWA3B (Chr11:3,521,329-3,522,551 in Holstein & Nordic Red Cattle) with milk glycosylated kappa-casein percentage,58 and were intergenic variants, such as Chr15:41,393,393-41,393,780 (in Jersey and Nordic Red Cattle) and Chr20:26,812,159-26,812,834 (in Holstein and Jersey) overlap QTL associated with calving traits,59,60 Chr20:45,816,245-45,820,519 (in Holstein & Nordic Red Cattle) with meat and carcass trait,61 and Chr23:49,778,653-49,782,567 (in Holstein and Nordic Red Cattle) with body weight.62 We also identified a highly differentiated fertility associated gene DST/BPAG163,64 (Chr23:3,486,232-3,486,603) in Nordic Red Cattle. One differentially selected deletion (VST = 0.28) of chromosome 3 (Chr3:12,141,822-12,170,916) overlapping ENSBTAG00000047776 and ENSBTAG00000024960 genes (human orthologue CD1D), drawn our attention (though it marginally failed our selection threshold); Holsteins exhibited VAF of 24.63% (have both homozygous and heterozygous deletion), while it is mostly homozygous for the reference allele in Nordic Red cattle (VAF = 0.62%) and Jersey (VAF = 0.0%). The CD1D gene has known function in host immune response and parasite resistance,65,66 and also reported differentially expressed post intra-mammary infection.67 Majority of these stratified deletion regions are novel compared with previous CNV studies in cattle, and therefore are interesting targets to investigate large deletions undergoing genetic drift or artificial selection.

Highly stratified genic-deletions, e.g. overlapping exons, introns, or UTRs, are highlighted with HGNC gene symbol.3.4. Functional impact of deletionsWe annotated all the deletions using Variant Effect Predictor (Ensembl 87). Around 71% (6,019 SVs) variants were intergenic and remaining 29% (2,461 SVs) overlapped genic elements, such as exons, introns, and UTR. On average, high frequency gene disrupting deletions were somewhat depleted compared with intergenic variants (VAFintergenic > VAFgenic, P-value = 0.04; one-sided Wilcoxon test). Furthermore, we observed many common genic deletions. These genes are relatively less conserved, and majority has multiple paralogs (discussed later). However, deletions on known essential genes were only observed as heterozygote with relatively low VAF (<3%), and generally were private to a specific breed. For example, FANCI deletions (cause brachyspina7) were only observed in Holstein, and RNASEH2B deletions (cause embryonic lethality9) in Nordic Red Cattle.The relative abundance of high-frequency genic and intergenic variants indicate that majority of these intersected genes are non-essential, and thus did not affect the viability or fecundity of the carriers. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the selective constraints between deleted genes (overlap of any genic element) and known mouse lethal genes (from Dickinson et al.42) in terms of dN/dS ratio of cow-mouse 1-to-1 orthologues (Fig. 7). Here, high dN/dS values indicate low selective constraints on genes, and low value indicates high constraints. We found that genes in deletions have significantly higher dN/dS ratios than lethal genes (P-value 2.3 × 10-6; one-sided Wilcoxon test), and thus are evolutionarily less conserved. This is consistent with the rate of evolution seen in essential and non-essential genes—where mutations in essential genes were under strong purifying selection and thus evolved slowly (low dN/dS ratio), while non-essential genes were under relaxed selection, and hence, evolved faster (high dN/dS ratio).68 Nonetheless, robustness of these processes is also evident in the evolution of human essential genes. Interestingly, ~77% human essential genes could even be traced back to pre-metazoans.69Difference between dN/dS ratios of mouse-lethal and deletion-overlapped genes in cattle. Cow genes for which one-to-one mouse orthologues available were considered for a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

Cow genes for which one-to-one mouse orthologues available were considered for a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Mouse lethal genes are from Dickinson et al.42In total, we found 5,000 deletions for which at least one individual was homozygous. In the set, we analysed homozygous deletions in genes to find natural gene knockouts. We found 167 deleted genes (transcript-ablation or complete deletion) corresponding to 115 independent deletions that are apparently nonessential based on the occurrences of live homozygote individuals. This is ~45% more than the previous report.23 Nonetheless, we found ~44% fewer genes compared with in humans (240 nonessential genes),15 which could be due to the differences in sample size (175 vs 2,504 individuals) and study populations (3 vs 26 populations in human).Among these genes, ~83% (139 genes) are protein-coding, 12% pseudogenes, and the rest are different types of small RNAs (Supplementary Table S6). Most of these genes belong to multigenic families and are not highly conserved (median cow-mouse dN/dS of 0.17 vs OMIA genes dN/dS of 0.11; Supplementary Fig. S6), as expected for homozygous deletion.15 Moreover, this set of genes are functionally enriched in immunoglobulin domains, olfactory receptors, and MHC classes (FDR = 2.06 × 10-22, 2.06 × 10-22, 7.01 × 10-6, respectively), along with other related domains (Supplementary Tables S7–S9). Similar functional enrichment of nonessential genes was also seen in humans.15 Olfactory receptor related genes are well known for extensive gains and losses in mammalian evolution.70 And population specific copy-number variations of olfactory receptor genes were also reported in human (deletions)71 and cattle (gains).72 Nevertheless, this is the first report, to our knowledge, of homozygous deletion of olfactory receptor genes in cattle.We next explored the enrichment (or depletion) of QTL on deleted regions (at least 1 bp overlap with deletion). We retrieved ~24 K autosomal QTL from QTLdb reported to be associated with any of the six trait classes, e.g. ‘Health’, ‘Reproduction’, ‘Milk’, ‘Exterior’, ‘Production’, and ‘Meat and Carcass’. The association of deletions with diseases, fitness or fertility related traits is well evident.3 Hence, we suspected enrichment of fitness and fertility related traits for our deletions. As expected, health (2-fold) and reproduction (1.5-fold) related QTL were significantly enriched, while other trait classes were highly depleted (Table 2). Higher enrichment of health related QTL could be driven by immune-system genes, which were also highly enriched in our dataset (discussed earlier).

Deletion formation mechanismsFinally we explored the probable mechanisms of deletion formation. There are two key mechanisms of SVs formation (for detail see review19,73); for example, recurrent SVs often result from ‘non-allelic homologous recombination’ between large low-copy repeats (LCRs), and thus, contain extensive sequence homology provided by LCRs, such as segmental duplicates, at the flanking regions.19 In contrast, non-recurrent SVs often form either by ‘microhomology-mediated end joining’ or ‘non-homologus end joining’, which requires limited to no sequence homology, and thus could be characterized by microhomologies or simple blunt ends at the breakpoint junction.73Breakpoint information is crucial for understanding the mechanism, and therefore, we analysed 29 breakpoint resolved deletions from our validation set. We found that 24 of 29 deletions contain microhomology ranging from 2 to 31 bp at the breakpoint, and two of which also contain insertions (Supplementary Table S2). In addition, four deletions exhibited non-reference insertion at breakpoint junctions, and one deletion with no apparent homology. However, the number of breakpoint sequences analysed here were not a robust representation of our deletion call-set (<0.5% deletions), though selected randomly (for validation), we were able to demonstrate that majority of deletions contain microhomoloy at breakpoint, followed by few insertions, and rarely with no homology. Our results largely agree with the trend reported for large deletions in humans, e.g. 70.8% deletions exhibited microhomology/homology and 16.1% insertions at the breakpoint.163.6. LimitationsThis study only focused on identifying deletions in cattle because of their potential relevance to loss-of-function and embryonic lethality. However, we had limited success to identify small deletions, such as <200 bp due to reduced sensitivity of the SV caller. It is also not a comprehensive list of deletions for these samples, since we could have missed many true deletions due to sensitivity, coverage, or stringent filtering (among other reasons). Furthermore, the short read length (~100 bp) in our WGS dataset also made it difficult to resolve breakpoints from regions of long repeats.3.7. ConclusionsLoss-of-function variants are responsible for a substantial yearly-economic loss in dairy industry, where a limited number of elite sires are in extensive use for rapid genetic gains. Mapping of such variants is essential for effective breeding planning and genomic selection. Here we showed an NGS-based analytical framework suitable for population-scale mapping of large deletions in cattle, leveraging the available WGSs. Here we described population-genetic, functional, and evolutionary properties of discovered deletions. We identified and confirmed a ~525 KB deletion on chromosome 23, causing stillbirth in Nordic Red Cattle. We demonstrated that Nordic Red Cattle had higher population diversity than Holstein and Jersey, and deletion-genotype could recapitulate genetic structure of these breeds. Natural gene knockouts are enriched for immune-related and olfactory receptor genes. We also showed that deletions are significantly enriched for health and fertility related QTL, while depleted for production related QTL. Our population genetic and functional analysis showed promise for inclusion of SVs in genomic studies in dairy cattle. This deletion catalog will facilitate discovery, genotyping, and imputation of deletions in large cohorts of animals, and subsequent studies for gene mapping and genomic prediction of breeding values.Md Mesbah-Uddin benefited from a joint grant from the European Commission within the framework of the Erasmus-Mundus joint doctorate ‘EGS-ABG’.FundingThis research was supported by the Center for Genomic Selection in Animals and Plants (GenSAP) funded by Innovation Fund Denmark (grant 0603-00519B).

IntroductionThe diploid strawberry F. vesca, also known as Alpine or woodland strawberry, is the most widely distributed species naturally growing in the northern hemisphere. It also contributed to one set of the octoploid genome of the cultivated strawberry Fragaria × ananassa.1,F. vesca genome (~240 Mb) is relatively small and its genome sequence was published in 2011.2 Several attributes of F. vesca make it a good model species of fruit crops, such as short stature, short life cycle, recurrent flowering, and high efficiency of transformation. To facilitate the gene functional studies in strawberry, we have identified and profiled the expression of protein-coding genes, lncRNAs and miRNAs using extensive transcriptome datasets generated mainly from flower and fruit tissues at different developmental stages with >80 individual libraries in F. vesca.3–7 As an emerging model species, F. vesca is playing more and more important roles both in the fields of basic biological research and in horticultural and agricultural research.The genome of F. vesca was first sequenced from a fourth-generation inbred line of Hawaii4 (F. vesca ssp. vesca) solely by second generation short read technologies, and its genome annotation v1.1 only contains protein-coding genes derived from ab initio gene predictions.2 Then, an updated annotation version (v1.1.a2) became available using 50 RNA-seq libraries generated from 25 different fruit tissue types to improve the annotation accuracy of protein-coding genes.8 In the meantime, a refined assembly of the F. vesca reference genome, named Fvb, was generated based on dense linkage maps of the North American diploid F. vesca ssp. bracteata.9 Compared with the original genome FvH4, Fvb features many translocations and inversions. Although Fvb still contains a large number of gaps that could be closed by utilizing long read sequencing technology, it has a much shorter unanchored pseudo-chromosome. The location of FvMYB10, a master regulator of anthocyanin production in strawberry, is moved from Chromosome 6 in FvH4 to Chromosome 1 in Fvb, where it is supposed to be according to genetic studies, illustrating that Fvb is of high quality.10 However, the gene annotation of Fvb (v2.0.a1) is not updated and merely obtained from the realignment of v1.1.Previously, we analysed the transcriptomes of floral and fruit tissues in F. vesca.3,4 During data analysis and gene functional studies, we noticed that a considerable proportion of genes are mis-annotated. The RNA-seq datasets from F. vesca (90 individual libraries) provide a rich data resource to re-annotate the genome. In addition, the PacBio full-length transcripts obtained from the fruit receptacle in F. vesca are also available,7 which were proven to significantly increase the accuracy of genome annotation without any assembly.11,12The annotation v2.0.a1 of Fvb contains only the coding regions from translation start site (ATG) to stop codon of protein-coding genes. However, recent studies highlight the importance of short ORFs (open reading frame) in 5' UTRs in fine-tuning gene functions.13 The 3' UTR sequences are also frequently needed for designing experiments. In addition, alternative splicing is an important regulatory mechanism at the post-transcriptional level, and up to 60% multi-exon protein-coding genes in plant genomes possess more than one isoform.7 Besides protein-coding genes, non-coding transcripts are pervasively expressed and constitute an integral part of the transcriptomes, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and miRNAs.5,6 Collectively, an updated genome annotation for F. vesca that marries the Fvb assembly with the broader collection of accurately predicted genes, coding and noncoding, is timely and highly desirable.Here, we optimized the genome annotation pipeline to improve the gene predictions in Fvb. We used a combination of MAKER2, AUGUSTUS, Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments (PASA), and manual curation to annotate protein-coding genes through integrating ab initio gene predictions, 90 RNA-seq transcriptome libraries and one PacBio full-length transcript library.14–17 The new annotation named V2.0.a2 not only updates the gene models of 13,168 loci, but also augments alternatively spliced isoforms of 7,370 genes, 5' and 3' UTRs of 18,641 genes, 1,938 lncRNAs, 171 miRNAs, and 51,714 small RNA clusters. Overall, V2.0.a2 provides a much more complete annotation of the F. vesca genome and will better serve gene functional studies in strawberry and other Rosaceae species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Transcriptome datasets used in this studyBoth full-length transcripts generated by PacBio and RNAseq datasets from different F. vesca accessions were used as evidence for gene annotation. The PacBio reads were generated from pooled fruit receptacles at different developmental stages.7 A total of 90 Illumina RNA-seq libraries are respectively generated from fruits, flowers, meristems, and roots.3,4,18 In addition, nine small RNA-seq libraries generated from vegetative, flower, and fruit tissues were also used for small RNA identification in this study.5 Details of these datasets are described in Supplementary Table S1.2.2. High-fidelity gene models identified from SMRT readsThe RS_IsoSeq pipeline (v2.3) was employed to analyse the PacBio data. First, the reads longer than 500 bp with the minimum full pass number of 2 and a quality score above 90 were retained. Then, the full-length reads having 5' primer, 3' primer, and a poly-A tail were further selected for downstream analysis. Next, these full-length reads were collapsed into consensus transcripts by ICE and Quiver in the isoseq_cluster panel. The LoRDEC software was used to correct the sequencing errors in the consensus transcripts using Illumina reads as the reference (parameters: -k 19 -s 3).19 The corrected consensus transcripts were then mapped by GMAP with >85% alignment coverage and >90% alignment identity.20 At last, the aligned transcripts were used for the identification of the best gene models using Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments (PASA).14 The scripts gff3_to_SNAP_train.pl bundled with SNAP, gmes_petap.pl bundled with GeneMark, and optimize_augustus.pl bundled with AUGUSTUS were used for training of each tool by the high-fidelity gene models with default parameters.2.3. A comprehensive transcriptome built from RNA-seq datasets and SMRT reads using PASAThe RNA-seq reads with more that 90% of their bases having a quality score higher than 28 were retained using fastq_quality_filter (-q 28 -p 90), and the bases with low quality score in each RNA-seq read were trimmed off using fastx_trim built in FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/ (5 September 2017, date last accessed)). Each library was mapped individually to Fvb9 downloaded from GDR (https://www.rosaceae.org (5 September 2017, date last accessed)) using Tophat221 with the following parameters: maximum intron size, 10,000bp; minimum intron size, 20 bp; fr-firststrand for strand-specific libraries.Reference-based assembly: For flower and fruit tissues, the aligned BAM files of the two biological replicates were, respectively, merged and sorted using Samtools (version 1.2)22 due to relatively lower sequencing depth, resulting in a total of 37 BAM files. The analyses on other libraries were carried out individually. Next, transcripts were assembled individually for each library by Stringtie23 with default settings except that the minimum isoform fraction was set to 0.3 to remove weakly expressed isoforms.De novo assembly: All the RNA-seq reads were pooled together for de novo assembly using Trinity24 with default parameters.To build a comprehensive transcriptome, the ID accessions of full-length and de novo transcripts were first fed into PASA, and full-length, genome-guided and de novo transcripts generated in parallel were then collapsed, mapped back to Fvb, and reconstructed by PASA through its alignment assembly module. The comprehensive transcriptome was later used as the mRNA evidence for MAKER2 described in the following section.2.4. MAKER2 annotationMAKER2 was used for generating an initial gene annotation.15 First, RepeatModeler (http://www.repeatmasker.org/ (5 September 2017, date last accessed)) was employed to identify and classify repeats from the genome Fvb, and then RepeatMasker (Repbase version 20160829) was used to generate a masked genome. Plant protein sequences were downloaded from UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/ (5 September 2017, date last accessed)) on 21 January 2017. MAKER2 was run on the masked Fvb with following evidence: Fvb annotation v2.0.a1, the comprehensive transcriptome, UniProt proteins, AUGUSTUS trained models, SNAP trained models, and GeneMark trained models.2.5. Further improve the genome using Augustus and EVMTo use Augustus,25 the following evidence were provided: (i) intron hints converted from uniquely mapped RNA-seq reads using the script bet_to_gff.pl bundled with GeneMark; (ii) intron hints converted from PacBio full-length transcripts by GMAP (http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/bioinf/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Augustus.PacBioGMAP (5 September 2017, date last accessed)); (iii) Protein hints generated from mapping UniPro proteins to masked genome by Exonerate;26 (iv) repeat hints from the RepeatMasker output (http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/bioinf/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Augustus.IncorporateRepeats (5 September 2017, date last accessed)). These hints were fed into Augustus to generate the high confidence gene models.Next, EVidenceModeler (EVM)27 was used to combine MAKER2 gene models, Augustus gene models, transcripts from SMRT and Illumina RNA-seq, and UniProt proteins with a nonstochastic weighted value into confident consensus gene models. The weight value for each part is: six for MAKER2 gene models, eight for Augustus gene models, 10 for SMRT transcripts, eight for Illumina transcripts, and three for homologous proteins. Finally, PASA was used to improve the EVM gene models by modifying gene structures and adding UTR annotations and alternatively spliced isoforms.2.6. Manual curation of new annotationAll the gene models were inspected one by one and manually curated using a plug-in called Apollo28 in JBrowse Genome Viewer29 based on the mapped reads from different RNA-seq libraries.2.7. Alternative splicing analysisAStalavista30 was employed to classify the alternative splicing events in the v2.0.a2 annotation. It groups the events into four major types, namely IR, ES, AA, and AD. The event belonging to each type were extracted from the AStalavista output by following codes: IR (AS code: 1^2-,0), ES (AS code: 1- 2^, 0), AA (AS code: 1-,2-), and AD (AS code: 1^,2^).2.8. Prediction of lncRNAsTwo approaches were used to identify lncRNAs. The transcripts combined from the assemblies of Illumina RNA-seq and PacBio full-length reads were used for screening lncRNAs. The mono-exonic transcripts were removed to reduce false positives due to transcriptional noise and ambiguous alignment. In the first approach, the transcripts with class_code ‘u’ (unknown intergenic transcript), ‘o’ (generic exonic overlap with a reference transcript), ‘x’ (natural antisense transcript, NAT), and ‘i’ (intronic transcript) were selected. Then, the transcripts with length > 200nt and ORF < 300nt were retained. Next, the left transcripts were blasted against the Swiss-Protein database by BLASTX (2.6.0)31 with E-values < 1e-3 to remove potential protein-coding transcripts. At last, we used Coding Potential Calculator32 to calculate the CPC score of each transcript, and only those with a CPC score < 0 were considered as lncRNA candidates. In the second approach, lncRNAs were identified from the same set of transcripts by FEELnc33 using the specificity threshold 0.97. The transcripts overlapping protein-coding genes in v2.0.a2 and < 200 nt in length were eliminated. FEELnc used the ORF coverage (i.e. length of the longest ORF/length of the lncRNA transcript), k-mer frequency, nucleotide frequency, and codon usage to distinguish between mRNAs and lncRNAs. Finally, the consensus transcripts identified by both methods were designated as lncRNAs. These lncRNAs were grouped into two major types (genic and intergenic) and six subtypes based on the localization and the direction of transcription relative to the proximal protein-coding genes by the FEELnc classifier module called FEELncclassifier.2.9. Alignment of small RNAsThe raw reads from 9 small RNA-seq libraries generated from tissues of F. vesca5 were used for the identification of small RNAs. First, the 3' adapters were trimmed off using Cutadapt.34 Then, the resulting .fasta file was mapped against the Fvb genome using bowtie (version 0.12.8)35 with following parameters: -q -v 0 -p 30 -S -a -m 50. ShortStack36 was subsequently employed to identify small RNA clusters, and only the dominant 20- to 24- nt in length and DCL-derived small RNA loci (more possibly related to RNAi) called out by ShortStack were retained. The expression level of each small RNA cluster was normalized using the count mode in ShortStack with default settings.2.10. Alignment of miRNAsThe stem-loop sequences of 171 miRNAs in F. vesca predicted by a previous report5 were mapped to the new F. vesca genome assembly Fvb by bowtie2 with default parameters, then the SAM file was converted into the GFF format by an in-house python script and integrated into the v2.0.a2 annotation file.2.11. Experimental verification of new gene modelsTotal RNA was isolated from the fruit receptacle of YW5AF7 (the 7th generation inbred line of Yellow Wonder, an accession of F. vesca) using the Plant Total RNA Isolation Kit (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China, No. SK8631) following manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg total RNA in 20 µl solution using the PrimeScriptTM RT reagent kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan, Cat# RR047A). KOD DNA polymerase (TOYOBO Bio-Tech, Cat# F0934K) was used to amplify the coding regions of selected genes for Sanger sequencing with primers listed in Supplementary Table S5. The sequencing results were aligned with the sequences obtained from new annotations by Clustal Omega (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/ (5 September 2017, date last accessed)).3. Results and discussion3.1. Update of gene models of protein-coding genes in Fvb based on SMRT and Illumina RNA-seq datasetsIn this study, a new Fvb annotation named version 2.0.a2 (v2.0.a2) was created that includes protein-coding genes, alternatively spliced isoforms of multiexon genes, small RNAs, and lncRNAs. An optimized workflow to annotate protein-coding genes and their isoforms is shown in Figure 1. To take advantage of the extensive RNA-seq datasets, MAKER2, specifically designed for second-generation genome projects, was first used to generate an initial protein-coding gene annotation.15 Input data for MAKER2 include (i) repeats masked genome Fvb, (ii) ab initio gene predictors, including SNAP, GeneMaker, and Augustus, each trained with high-fidelity gene models, (iii) plant protein sequences downloaded from UniProt databases, (iv) transcripts assembled from a total of 90 Illumina RNA-seq libraries, (v) full length transcripts obtained from one PacBio transcriptome library (Supplementary Table S1). The Illumina RNA-Seq datasets were generated from a series of tissue types in F. vesca, including leaf, seedling, root, shoot apical meristem, flower meristem, anther and carpel from flowers at different developmental stages and different fruit tissues at five stages with an average of 30 million and a range from 12 million to 89 million reads per library (see details in Supplementary Table S1). In total, there are 2.5 billion RNA-Seq short reads. The PacBio data was generated from fruit receptacles pooled from small green to mature stages in F. vesca, containing 82,360 full-length consensus transcripts derived from 442,601ReadofInserts.

The red dotted box indicates the core tools used for the annotation. In the end, manual curation was carried out to assure the accuracy.The ambiguity of transcript reconstruction will affect the accuracy of gene annotation when using MAKER2. To avoid assembly errors in gene prediction, it is advantageous to use the transcript information in unassembled mapped reads.37 Augustus is a gene finder that can incorporate data from RNA-seq reads (junctions reads) directly into weighted predictions, join exons into a single gene and identify alternative transcription events.25 Therefore, Augustus was employed to further improve gene predictions through incorporating the intron hints from RNA-seq reads and protein hints from UniProt databases. Then, the gene structures predicted by both MAKER2 and Augustus were combined into consensus gene models using EVidenceModeler (EVM),27 and the gene models generated from EVM were updated by PASA.14 At last, the new annotation was inspected across the entire genome in IGV38 to evaluate the prediction and select the optimal gene models by comparing with the aligned RNA-seq reads, and about 1,000 (3%) genes were manually curated in this way.Annotation v2.0.a2 of the genome Fvb contains a final set of 33,538 protein-coding loci with 50,738 transcripts (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). The Locus IDs for 30,012 identical or modified genes stay the same between the older annotation v2.0a1 and this annotation (v2.0.a2), while 3,525 genes (novel or split) were newly numbered using the same nomenclature as previous annotations (i.e. GeneXXXXX). The Locus IDs in both versions for the newly modified genes are listed in Supplementary Table S3. One improvement of v2.0.a2 is that a total of 18,641 genes were augmented by inclusion of 5' UTRs and/or 3' UTRs, representing nearly 55.6% of all protein-coding genes (Fig. 2a and b). Moreover, the gene models of 13,168 protein-coding genes were modified and updated (Fig. 2a and c). More specifically, 2,692 genes were derived from splitting longer genes (previously fused genes), and 213 genes were obtained by fusing neighbouring genes (Fig. 2a, d, and e). In addition, 2,031 genes were removed, and 631 genes were added (Fig. 2a). To further evaluate the quality of the annotation, the BUSCO genes39 were compared between v2.0.a1 and v2.0.a2. The results show a significant increase of complete BUSCOs from 88.9% for v2.0.a1 to 95.7% for v2.0.a2, while the fragmented and missing BUSCOs were reduced in v2.0.a2 (Table 1), indicating a higher quality annotation. These updates will better serve gene structure and functional studies.

Functional annotation of protein-coding genesTo update the functional annotation of novel and pre-existing protein-coding genes in v2.0.a2, all the protein sequences were blasted against known proteins in the InterPro databases using InterProScan.40 In addition, each gene was also blasted against the NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database to gain the Gene ontology (GO) term by Blast2go.41 As a result, a total of 28,798 and 22,106 genes in v2.0.a2 gained functional annotations and GO terms, respectively (Table 1). Especially, there is a great increase in the percentage of genes with GO terms, from 51% in v2.0.a1 to 66% in v2.0.a2 (Table 1). For novel genes, 527 of the 631 loci (83.5%) were assigned with functional annotations.Transcription factors and regulators and protein kinases usually play crucial roles during signal transduction. In the iTAK pipeline42 that we used for the classification of these genes, transcription factors are defined as proteins that regulate the expression of target genes by binding to specific cis-elements in promoter regions, while transcriptional regulators operate indirectly via interaction with the basal transcription apparatus (e.g. transcription factors) or by altering the accessibility of DNA to TFs via chromatin remodelling to regulate the expression of target genes. As a result, we identified 1,542 transcription factors from 68 families, and 390 transcriptional regulators in the v2.0.a2 annotation by using the iTAK pipeline (Supplementary Table S4).42 The total number of transcription factors is comparable to that of v2.0.a1, but a few gene families have gained relatively more members, such as the B3 family from 67 to 78, MYB from 112 to 118, and bHLH from 90 to 101 (Supplementary Table S4). There are 1,055 protein kinase encoding genes in v2.0.a2, which are 90 more in the older annotation (Supplementary Table S4).Disease resistance is an important agricultural trait for strawberry as well as other fruit crops, thus we also used the RGAugury pipeline43 to analyse R-genes and pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), collectively called resistance gene analogs (RGAs), in the two annotation versions of Fvb. The RGAs are classified into four major families based on conserved domains and motifs in this pipeline, namely NBS encoding, membrane associated RLP (receptor-like protein) and RLK (receptor-like protein kinase), and TM-CC (transmembrane-coiled-coil).43 The first three families were further grouped into a few subfamilies. A total of 1,190 RGAs were identified, including 340 NBS encoding genes, 122 RLPs, 590 RLKs, and 138 TM-CCs in v2.0.a2 (Supplementary Table S5). Although the gene number in the NBS encoding family is comparable between the two annotations, the TNL subfamily has much more members (from 17 to 79), while the TX subfamily has fewer members (from 124 to 59) (Supplementary Table S5). The size of the RLP and RLK families doesn’t change much. However, the gene number in the TM-CC family is significantly decreased, from 192 genes in v2.0.a1 to 138 genes in v2.0.a2.With the advantage of strand-specific RNA-seq reads, we were able to distinguish the sense and antisense transcripts from one locus. One example of such a locus having overlapping transcripts derived from opposite strands is gene02467, which codes for a tRNA ligase. This gene is located in one intron of an extremely long gene called gene02466 that encodes the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (Fig. 3a). By contrast, the same locus was previously annotated to have four genes in v2.0.a1 (Fig. 3a). FvSOC1, the homolog of AtSOC1 (SUPPRESSOR OF THE OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS), is a key negative regulator of flowering and a positive regulator of runnering in F. vesca.44,FvSOC1 does not exist in v2.0.a1. However, the modified gene19424 with a brand new gene model in v2.0.a2 has exactly the same sequence as the EST of FvSOC1 (accession number in NCBI: JF806634) (Fig. 3b). In addition, some gene models were fine-tuned in v2.0.a2 to have a higher annotation quality. For instance, FvTFL1, another crucial floral repressor in F.vesca,45,46 has a new translation start site producing a shorter protein, which becomes consistent with the published sequence in NCBI (accession number: JF806631) (Fig. 3c). A few other mis-annotated genes encoding glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), the red/far-red photoreceptor phytochrome B, and a bHLH transcription factor were PCR amplified, cloned and sequenced to confirm the v2.0.a2 annotation (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S6). Taken together, not only were a large proportion of pre-existing genes corrected, but also novel genes with potentially important roles were discovered and incorporated into the new annotation.

Alternatively spliced genes in v2.0.a2Alternative splicing (AS) is an important regulatory mechanism at post-transcriptional level and is prevalent in animals as well as plants.47,48 However, the v2.0.a1 annotation does not provide any information about the isoforms alternatively spliced from the pre-mRNAs. The v2.0.a2 annotation takes into account and provides the specific information on the alternatively spliced transcripts predicted by our analysis pipeline (Fig. 1). To increase the prediction accuracy, weakly expressed transcripts in the RNA-seq datasets were removed during the assembly using Stringtie.23 A total of 16,705 alternative transcripts were detected genome-wide from 7,370 multiexon genes, accounting for 21.98% of the 33,538 protein-coding genes. The average transcript number per gene is 1.51. As we used a more stringent filtering strategy, much fewer isoforms were presented in v2.0.a2 than that of our previous study (47,000 isoforms from 13,591 alternatively spliced genes, accounting for 41.6% of all the protein coding genes).7Among the AS genes, about half of them (46.85%) possess only two isoforms, 23.19% genes possess three isoforms, and 1.28% genes have >10 isoforms (Fig. 4a). 7,370 AS genes showed enriched GO terms in all kinds of metabolic processes (Supplementary Table S7), consistent with our previous studies.7,49 To better characterize alternative splicing (AS) in the new annotation, AStalavista was used to group the AS events into a few major types.30 3,434 events are of alternative 3' splice sites (A3), 1,351 events are of alternative 5' splice sites (A5), 4,245 events are due to intron retention (IR), and 1,029 events result from exon skipping (ES) (Fig. 4b). Consistent with other studies,7,49 the percentage of IR (32.39%) is the greatest, while the percentage of ES (7.85%) is the least. Features of the alternative splicing events in v2.0.a2.

Non-coding RNAsNon-coding RNAs are the integral part of the genome. To further improve the annotation of F.vesca genome, the loci producing small RNAs and lncRNAs were both integrated into the new annotation v2.0.a2.Thus far, most of the small RNAs with known functions are 21–24nt long, such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), miRNAs, phasiRNAs, and tasiRNAs. These small RNAs regulate the expression of target genes through transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) or post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). Among them, 171 miRNAs, including 44 novel miRNAs and 127 conserved miRNAs, have been previously identified in F. vesca,5 but their locations in the genome are lacking. In this study, the stem-loop precursor sequences of these miRNAs were all uniquely aligned to Fvb, and the coordinates for the stem-loop and mature miRNA sequences were integrated into v2.0.a2 (Supplementary Table S8).Besides, siRNAs of 24nt are most widespread in the genome.6 Here, we analyzed a total of 9 small RNA-seq libraries generated from open flower, 4 DPA (days post anthesis)-seed, 10 DPA-seed, 4 DPA-carpel wall, 10 DPA-carpel wall, flower bud, young leaf, young seedling, and 10 DPA-fruit receptacle in F. vesca from a previous study.5 ShortStack,36 a popular pipeline used for small RNA annotation in Arabidopsis and other species,49–51 was employed to identify small RNA clusters with 20–24nt small RNAs in Fvb. Finally, 51,714 small RNA clusters were identified with 24nt small RNAs as the most abundant type, accounting for 98.46% out of all small RNA clusters (Supplementary Table S9). Furthermore, 15,705 (30.4%) and 1,544 (2.99%) of these clusters overlap with protein-coding genes and lncRNAs, respectively. When the gene density of small RNA clusters was plotted across the seven chromosomes, it roughly negatively correlated with that of protein-coding genes in both v2.0.a1 and v2.0.a2 (Fig. 5).

Darker colour indicates a higher density.LncRNAs are defined as non-coding RNAs with a length >200 bp. To annotate lncRNAs in F. vesca, we used two independent methods to identify them and only retained the consensus ones (see Methods). Overall, we identified a total of 1,938 lncRNA loci with more than one exon in the F. vesca genome, corresponding to a total of 4,042 transcripts (2.1 isoforms per locus on average). The exon number distribution of lncRNAs showed that lncRNAs have fewer exons than protein coding genes. 53% of lncRNAs possess two or three exons, while only 32% of the protein-coding genes possess two or three exons (Fig. 6a). The gene length of lncRNAs varies from 201 to 12,722 bp, and the mean length is 1,479 bp. In this pipeline, the lncRNAs were first classified into two major groups, intergenic and genic, based on the location relative to protein-coding genes (Supplementary Fig. S2). Intergenic lncRNAs can be further classified into three subgroups: same_strand, located in the same strand with the neighbouring protein-coding gene; convergent, convergent transcription with the neighbouring protein-coding gene in different strands; divergent, divergent transcription with the neighbour protein-coding gene in different strands (Supplementary Fig. S2). Genic lncRNAs can also be classified into three subgroups: overlapping, lncRNA is longer at one end and shorter at the other end than the overlapped protein-coding gene; containing, lncRNA is longer than the overlapped protein-coding gene at both ends; nested, lncRNA is shorter than the overlapped protein-coding gene at both ends.33 Among the 4,042 lncRNA transcripts, the intergenic type contains 1,413 same_strand, 873 convergent, and 786 divergent lncRNA transcripts; the genic type contains 689 overlapping, 74 containing, and 207 nested transcripts (Fig. 6b;Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S10).

ConclusionsThe F. vesca genome was first released with annotations of merely protein coding genes that were mainly derived from ab initio predictions.2 Then, an updated genome of high quality called Fvb was re-assembled based on genetic linkage mapping with the same annotation.9 RNA-seq datasets generated from strawberry fruits have been previously utilized for F. vesca genome reannotation,8 however, it was based on limited number and type of tissue samples, short Illumina reads, and was again restricted to protein-coding genes. With the recent advancement in genome sequencing, especially the availability of third generation long read sequencing data, and accumulation of large number of RNA-seq datasets from diverse tissues, creating a new and improved re-annotation for the most recent genome assembly is timely. Here, we developed an optimized pipeline to re-annotate the strawberry Fvb genome taking advantage of PacBio full-length transcripts and an extensive dataset of RNA-seq libraries. This new annotation, v2.0.a2, updated the F. vesca gene models and includes new information ranging from 5' and 3' UTRs to alternatively spliced transcripts. In addition, non-coding genes, including small RNAs and lncRNAs, were also integrated into this new annotation. To conclude, our new annotation is much more complete than the older annotation and will provide a valuable resource for the strawberry and the Rosaceae research community as well as for comparative and functional studies in flowering plants.5.

IntroductionNon-coding RNA such as microRNAs (miRNA) and long non-coding RNAs exist in many cells and regulate gene expression and possibly perform other biological functions.1–5 Circular RNAs are a novel non-coding RNA that forms a covalently closed continuous loop and have been observed for decades in plant viroids6 and in a few mammalian genes.7–10 CircRNAs were generally considered to be splicing artifacts or by-products until recent advances in RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technology.11 CircRNAs are served as a new class of RNAs that have been identified widespread in eukaryotic tissues and cells from humans, mice, nematodes, fruit flies and plants.12–19CircRNAs can arise from exons, introns, untranslated regions, non-coding RNA loci as well as intergenic and antisense transcripts. They are abundantly and widely expressed in eukaryotes, and often show tissue and developmental stage-specific expression patterns.12,15,20 In some genes, circular RNA isoforms are even more abundant than their linear counterparts.21 CircRNAs are also expressed across eukaryotes, and in humans, hundreds of exonic circRNAs are found to be with circular orthologues in murine.18–22The biological functions of circRNA are still largely unknown but they are implicated in the regulation of gene expression at multiple levels. Some exonic circRNAs (eciRNA) can function as miRNA sponges, which compete with mRNAs for miRNA binding and thus up-regulate the expression of miRNAs target gene. One representative example is the cerebellar degeneration-related 1 antisense transcript (CDR1as) that contains over 60 conserved miR-7 target sites.13,14 A CDR1as knockdown leads to reduced expression of mRNAs containing miR-7-binding sites. Overexpression of CDR1as has an effect similar to a miR-7 knockdown and this impaired midbrain development in zebrafish.13 Circular RNAs can regulate transcription via RNA Pol II interactions and have been demonstrated for the ciRNA (intronic circular RNA) ci-ankrd52 and ci-sirt7.23 EIciRNAs (exon-intron circular RNA) regulate their parental genes through interaction with the spliceosome component U1 snRNP (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein).24 CircRNA biogenesis may also compete with pre-mRNA splicing and thus regulate linear mRNA levels.25 In addition, some circRNAs have been found to serve as templates for coding peptides or proteins, especially in that modified by N6-methyladenosine or with the presence of internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES).26–29Skeletal muscle is the most important component of food animals and directly correlates with meat quantity and quality. The growth and development of skeletal muscle involves a series of very complex biological process, regulated by many signaling pathways, genes, transcription factors and ncRNAs.30–33 CircRNAs can play important roles in biologic processes as well as human disease.34–36 CircRNAs also have been identified abundantly expressed in monkey skeletal muscle and may play key roles in growth and development.37 In this study, we identified circRNAs during chicken embryonic skeletal muscle development by RNA sequencing to explore the functions of circRNAs in chicken skeletal muscle.2. Materials and methods2.1. Ethics standardsAnimal experiments were handled in compliance and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. It was approved by the Animal Care Committee of South China Agricultural University (Guangzhou, China) with approval number SCAU#0014.2.2. Samples for circular RNA sequencingA total of 240 XH chickens of E10 embryonic age were obtained from the Chicken Breeding Farm of South China Agricultural University (Guangzhou, China), and incubated in Automatic Incubator (Oscilla, Shandong, China) at 37.8 °C, with 60 ± 10% humidity. During E10 to 1 day post hatch (P1), leg muscles of 20 XH chickens were collected daily. The sex of chicken embryo was identified by PCR of the CHD1 gene.38 Leg muscles of female XH chickens at E11, E16 and P1 were used for circular RNA sequencing.2.3. Circular RNA library construction and Illumina sequencingTotal RNAs of six female chickens (E11, E16, and P1; each stage two individuals), were isolated by using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and then treated with DNase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The quantity and quality of RNAs were evaluated by Nanodrop2000 (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA) and gel electrophoresis. Total RNA samples (5 µg) were treated with the Ribo-Zero-magnetic-kit (Epicenter, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) to remove rRNA, and then digested with 20 U of RNase R (RNR07250, Epicenter). RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using the Tru Seq RNA LT Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were sequenced using an Illumina Hiseq 3000 instrument with a Paired-End module (at a depth of 50 million reads) at Genergy Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).2.4. Annotation of chicken circRNAsAll sequencing data are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with accession number (GSE89355). For all raw sequencing data of each sample, adapter reads and low-quality reads were removed using Trim Galore (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/ (16 September 2017, date last accessed)). The filtered data were mapped to the chicken genome (Gallus_gallus-4.0/galGal4) using TopHat software.39 The mapping reads was performed transcript assembly using Cufflinks software.40 Identification of circRNAs was performed using CIRI.412.5. Differential expression analysisExpression levels of circRNAs were quantified using the number of reads spanning back-spliced junctions (circular reads). The relative expression of circRNAs was denoted as BSRP (back-spliced reads per million mapped reads), using circular reads normalized to per million mapped reads. Differentially expressed circRNAs among three groups (E11, E16 and P1) were identified using the DESEQ software package (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEGseq.html (16 September 2017, date last accessed)) with a t test q-value < 0.05 and fold change > 2. The top 200 expressed circRNAs were log2 transformed, gene mean centered and visualized as heatmaps using the Multi Experiment Viewer (http://www.tm4.org/ (16 September 2017, date last accessed)).2.6. Target miRNA prediction, pathway and network analysisAll exonic circRNAs were used to predict miRNAs potential binding sites using miRanda (http://www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do (16 September 2017, date last accessed)) with threshold parameters as follows: single-residue-pair match scores > 140, <U+0394>G < -10 kcal/mol and demand strict 5’ seed pairing. All parental genes of differentially expressed circRNAs were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) (http://www.geneontology.org/ (16 September 2017, date last accessed)) and KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ (16 September 2017, date last accessed)) pathway enrichment analysis using DAVID 6.7 Functional Annotation Tool (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/ (16 September 2017, date last accessed)). All parental genes of circRNAs were set as the background gene list. Gene network analysis was performed by Ingenuity Pathways analysis (IPA; Ingenuity Systems; http://www.ingenuity.com (16 September 2017, date last accessed)).2.7. Validation of circRNAs by Sanger sequencingThe circRNAs were validated using PCR with divergent and convergent primers as previously described.22 Divergent primers were designed in regions about 100 bp from a junction, and convergent primers were designed in regions of one exon (Details of primers are summarized in Supplementary Table S1). To confirm the junction sequence of circRNAs, PCR products of divergent primers were gel purified and submitted for Sanger sequencing at Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China).2.8. cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)Total RNA was used for reverse transcription using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Waltham, MA, USA) with either random hexamers or specific primers for miRNAs as indicated. The relative expression levels of circRNAs or miRNAs were determined by qRT-PCR using SsoFast Eva Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in a final volume of 20 µl. To check the sensitivity of circRNA to RNaseR, qRT-PCR was also performed using RNA samples with and without RNaseR treatment. Primers used for circRNAs were designed as divergent primers to detect backsplice junctions, and bulge-loop primers were synthesized by Ribobio (Guangzhou, China) for miRNAs (Details of primers are summarized in Supplementary Table S1). The ß-actin gene was used as reference genes for circRNAs, and U6 snRNA was used as reference gene for miRNAs. The qRT-PCR program was performed in a BIO-RAD CFX96 system as follows: 95 °C for 3 min; 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, annealing temperature (58–62 °C) for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; and 72 °C for 1 min. The relative expression level of miRNA was calculated using the comparative 2-<U+0394>Ct (<U+0394>Ct = Cttarget gene– Ctreference gene). Fold change values were calculated using the comparative 2-<U+0394><U+0394>Ct, in which <U+0394><U+0394>Ct = <U+0394>Ct (target sample) - <U+0394>Ct (control sample). All reactions were run in triplicate and presented as means ± s.e.m. The Student’s t-test was used to compare expression levels among different groups.2.9. Vector construction and RNA oligonucleotidesThe perfect match sequence of gga-miR-1a-3p° or gga-miR-206 was synthesized and cloned into the psiCHECK-2 vector (Promega) using the NotI and XhoI restriction sites. The circRNA overexpression vectors were constructed using the linear sequences of circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 amplified from chicken leg muscle cDNA using PCR. They were then cloned into pCD-ciR2.1vector (Supplementary Fig. S1, Geneseed Biotech, Guangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol using the KpnI and BamHI restriction sites. The wild type and mutated 3’UTRs sequences of CCND1, CCND2, PAX7 and HDAC4 were synthesized and cloned into the pmirGLO dual-luciferase reporter vector (Promega) using the NheI and XhoI restriction sites. The exon2-3 or exon2-4 of RBFOX2 were synthesized and cloned into the pcDNA3.1+ vector (Invitrogen) using the NheI and SalI restriction sites. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) of circRNAs (sequences are summarized in Supplementary Table S1), miRNA mimics and inhibitors were synthesized by Ribobio.2.10. Cell culture and transfectionChicken primary myoblasts were isolated from the leg muscles of E11 chickens. Leg muscle (1 g) was minced into sections of approximately 1 mm with scissors and digested with 0.25% trypsin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) at 37 °C in a shaking water bath (90 oscillations/min). Digestions were terminated by adding foetal bovine serum (Gibco) after 30 min. The mixture was filtered through a nylon mesh with 70 µm pores (BD Falcon). The filtered cells were centrifuged at 350g for 5 min, and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco), supplemented with 20% foetal bovine serum, and 0.2% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere. Serial plating was performed to enrich myoblasts and remove fibroblasts. DF-1 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% foetal bovine serum and 0.2% penicillin/streptomycin. QM-7 cells were cultured in high-glucose M199 medium (Gibco) with 10% foetal bovine serum, 10% tryptose phosphate broth solution (Sigma, Louis, MO, USA) and 0.2% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected with 50 nM of miRNA mimics, 100 nM of miRNA inhibitors, 100 nM of siRNA or plasmid (1 µg/ml) using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.2.11. Luciferase reporter assay and Northern blot analysisDF-1 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and co-transfected with the dual-luciferase reporter (psiCHECK-2) and miRNA mimics or NC (negative control) and with circRNA overexpression vector, circRNA mutated vector or empty vector (EV) using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent. After transfection for 48 h, the luminescent signals of firefly and Renilla luciferase were detected using Dual-GLO Luciferase Assay System Kit (Promega) with a Fluorescence/Multi-Detection Microplate Reader (Biotek,Winooski, VT, USA). Northern blotting for miR-206 and U6 were performed with MiRNA Northern Blot Assay Kit (Signosis, Santa Clara, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.2.12. Flow cytometry analysis of the cell cycleAfter transfection 48 h, myoblasts were collected and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at -20 °C. The cells were incubated with 50 µg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), 10 µg/ml RNaseA (Takara) and 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. Analyses were performed using a BD AccuriC6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and FlowJo (v7.6) software (Treestar Incorporated, Ashland, OR, USA).2.13. EdU assayQM-7 cells were seeded in 12-well plates, and at 80% confluence, cell were transfected with overexpression vector or siRNA of circRNAs, miRNA mimic, miRNA inhibitor or negative control. After transfection for 36 h, cell proliferation was tested using a Cell-Light EdU Apollo 567 in Vitro Flow Cytometry Kit (Ribobio). The cells were first incubated with 50 µM EDU for 2 h at 37 °C, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. The proliferating cells were stained with Apollo Dye Solution and Hoechst 33342 (used as control). The EdU-stained cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The cell proliferation rate was calculated using images of randomly selected fields obtained from the fluorescence microscope. We performed four repeats for each group, and three images were used to calculate the cell proliferation rate in each repeat.2.14. HistologyThe leg muscle samples were <U+FB01>xed in 4% paraformaldehyde for a minimum of 24 h and then embedded in paraffin and 10-mm thick serial sections were made. The sections were then subjected to H-E staining following standard protocols. Images were taken using a Moticam 2306 CCD imaging system (Motic Instruments, CA, USA).2.15. RNA immunoprecipitation and biotin-coupled miRNA pull downRIP experiments were performed by using the Magna RIP RNA-Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation Kit (Millipore, Bedford, MA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Immunoprecipitation of AGO2 was performed in QM7 cells co-transfected with circRBFOX2s expression vector and miR-1a-3p°, miR-206 or miR-203 control. The mRNA levels of circRBFOX2s were quantified by qRT–PCR and were normalized to GAPDH gene. The relative immunoprecipitate/input ratios are plotted.The 3’ end biotinylated miR-1a-3p°, miR-206 or miR-203 mimic (RiboBio) were transfected into QM7 cells along with circRBFOX2s expression vector. The biotin-coupled RNA complex was pull-downed by Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA bound to the beads (pull-down RNA) was isolated using Trizol LS reagent (Invitrogen). The mRNA levels of circRBFOX2s in the streptavidin captured fractions were quantified by qRT–PCR and the enrichment ratios of the miR-1a-3p° or miR-206 to the miR-203 control were plotted.3. Results and discussion3.1. Overview of circular RNA deep sequencing dataIn recent years, a number of reports demonstrated that circRNAs were widespread and abundant existed in various eukaryotes, especially in mammals. However, little information is known regarding circRNAs in domestic animals with the exception of brain cortex of pig42 and mammary gland tissues of cattle.43 Here, we performed the genome-wide identification and potential function analysis of circRNAs in chickens. The total number of muscle fibers is the determining factor in muscle mass and this is regulated during embryogenesis or early post hatch in chickens.44,45 To identify the circRNA during the chicken embryonic skeletal muscle development, leg muscle tissues of two female XH chicken for each at days E11, E16 and P1 were used for RNA sequencing after rRNA-depletion and RNase R treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2). The sex of XH chicken embryos was identified (Supplementary Fig. S3A) and leg muscle tissues of female chickens were performed using hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) staining to visual the muscle fibers during 10 embryo age to post hatch (Supplementary Fig. S3B).For RNA-seq, a total of about 750 million reads were generated from all six samples, and each sample yielded more than 100 million reads. Raw data were processed to remove adapter and low quality sequences, and then mapped to the chicken reference genome (Gallus_gallus-4.0/galGal4) (Supplementary Table S2). The mapping reads were uniformly distributed in each chromosome, except the abundance in the chromosome MT is much larger than that of the other chromosomes (Fig. 1A).From the six muscle tissues, a total of 13,377 circRNAs were detected; 7,914 in E11, 10,949 in E16, and 9,309 in P1, and 5,176 were detected in all three stages (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table S3) using the CIRI algorithm method.41 These results agree with the scope and abundance of circRNAs that have been identified in mammals.18,21 According to their genomic locus, the chicken circRNAs were grouped as exon (including 5’UTR, 5’UTR-CDS, CDS-3’UTR, 3’UTR and 5’UTR -CDS-3’UTR), intron, exon-intron, intergenic regions or others. Although circRNAs can arise from almost any location in a genome, they are most originate from coding exons.13,17–19 We also found 11,064 of 13,377 circRNAs were derived from known chicken genes, especially in coding DNA sequences (CDS) (n = 8,110). The other circRNAs were derived from introns, exon-introns, intergenic regions or other regions (Fig. 1C). All these circRNAs were originated from 3,589 chicken genes. Among them, 1,555 parental genes generated only one circRNA, and the other genes could yield two or more circular isoforms, even smaller fractions yielded more than ten distinct circular isoforms (Fig. 1D), similar to the results in pigs.42Annotation of chicken embryonic muscle circRNA.

The number of circRNAs expressed at various cutoff expression levels in each sample are shown in Figure 1E and F. A total of 3,036 circRNAs were defined as highly expressed circRNA (BSRP > 1), and 2,579 of them were detected in the three developmental stages we examined (Fig. 1G). The 10 most abundant circRNAs expressed in embryonic muscle are listed in Table 1. The majority of highly expressed circRNAs was derived from exons and as a group was more abundant than other circRNA types (Fig. 1H).

Identification of differentially expressed circRNAsCircRNAs are usually expressed in tissue and developmental stage specific manners. Especially during embryonic development, circRNA expression levels exhibit dynamic global changes.17,42,46 To address the potential functions of circRNA, differentially-expressed circRNAs (DEcircRNAs) were identified by DEGseq analysis (fold change > 2, q-value < 0.05) and clustered based on their expression profiles (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S4). A total of 462 DEcircRNAs were detected in the three developmental groups, 236, 285 and 89 circRNAs in E11_VS_E16, E11_VS_P1, and E16_VS_P1 comparison groups, respectively. These circRNAs were more abundant in E16 and P1 than in E11, whereas a small fraction of group E11 was quantitatively higher (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Tables S4–S6). We found that 223, 526 and 255 circRNAs were specifically expressed in E11, E16 and P1, respectively (Fig. 2C). A larger number of circRNAs are differentially expressed in chicken leg muscle development. We performed RNA sequencing used two individuals in each stage but not mix RNA pool. The variation of circRNAs abundance was also existed between the two duplicates used for sequencing. The numbers of circRNAs were larger in E16 or P1 than that in E11 of leg muscle, consistent with that circRNAs were found to accumulate during aging in Drosophila heads.17Differentially expressed circRNAs in three different development stages of embryonic muscle.

The Y axis represents GO terms and the X axis represents –Log p-value.The biogenesis of circRNA can competes with pre-mRNA splicing, and intron or exon-intron circRNAs can regulate the transcription of their parental gene.23–25 In this study, we performed GO Enrichment Analysis for the parental genes of differentially-expressed circRNAs (fold change > 2, P-value < 0.05) in E11_VS_E16, E11_VS_P1 and E16_VS_P1 comparison groups (Supplementary Tables S7–S9). The parental gene functions were involved in muscle-related biological processes, including muscle structure development, muscle tissue development, muscle system processes and muscle cell differentiation (Fig. 2D–F). Using this data, we organized a functional network using Ingenuity pathway analysis (Supplementary Table S10). The most prevalent diseases and function interaction network was related to skeletal and muscular disorders and this group involved 29 parental genes (Supplementary Fig. S5).3.3. Putative functions of chicken circRNAs as miRNA spongesThe spatial-temporal grouping of circRNAs suggested that they are functional molecules. Since the discovery of CDR1as can serve as miR-7 sponges,13,14 there are growing evidences indicate that circRNAs can function as miRNA sponges or competing endogenous RNAs.17,47–51 However, unlike CDR1as contain multiple binding sites to sponge miR-7, most circRNAs bind more than one species of miRNA as was shown for circFOXO352 and circHIPK3.53 We identified the miRNA binding capabilities of our differentially expressed exonic circRNAs, and found that 946 of 1,401 exonic circRNAs harbored one or more miRNA binding site and involved 150 known miRNAs (The top 10 of these circRNAs were listed in Table 2). We used the 20 most abundant differentially expressed exonic circRNAs from each comparison group and matched them with their potential target miRNAs. These data were then used to construct an interactive network map (Fig. 3). We identified several miRNAs with key roles in skeletal muscle development and differentiation such as miR-1, miR-133, miR-206 and miR-203 in this network. The high abundance of these DEcircRNAs could be served as candidate circRNAs to further study in chicken skeletal muscle.

We identified 11 isoforms of RBFOX2 circRNAs (Fig. 4A) and six of them were expressed abundantly and differentially in muscle (Fig. 4B). Four isoforms circRBFOX2.2-3, 2-4, 2-6, and 2-9 harbored miR-1a-3p and miR-206 binding sites (Fig. 4C). The interaction of circRBFOX2s with miR-1a-3p and miR-206 was further validated in our study.

Experimental validation of chicken circRNAsThe expression and back-splicing sites of several circRNAs were validated by divergent reverse-transcription PCR, RNaseR digestion and qRT-PCR, according to previously described methodologies.13,54 Divergent primers and convergent primers were designed to amplify six candidate circRNAs in cDNA and genomic DNA samples. Divergent primers from each circRNA produced a single distinct band of the expected product size only in cDNA samples suggesting the presence of back-splicing junctions but not genomic rearrangements (Fig. 5A). PCR products of divergent primers were further detected by Sanger sequencing to confirm the back-splicing junctions (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S6). To detect the resistance of circRNA to the digestion by RNaseR, we quantified the six candidate circRNAs with RNaseR treatment compared to control by qRT-PCR. All tested circRNAs showed much more resistant than the linear mRNA control (Fig. 5C). In addition, the expression of six differentially expressed circRNAs was also validated by qRT-PCR in E11_VS_E16, E11_VS_P1, and E16_VS_P1 comparison groups. Except the expression of circRBFOX2.2-4 and circFGFR2.3-6 in P1 VS E16 compared group, the expression patterns of these circRNAs were consistent with the RNA-Seq results, indicating that the deep sequencing results were reliable (Fig. 5D).

CircRBFOX2 interacts with miR-206 and miR-1aTwo circular isoforms of RBFOX2 which we designated as circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 were derived from exon2-3 and exon 2-4 of RBFOX2, respectively. Both these molecules possessed miR-1a-3p and miR-206 binding sites (Fig. 6A and B). The prediction of a miRNA target site does not necessarily mean that a miRNA binds to that site. To further validate that these two circRBFOX2s can be interacted with miR-1a-3p and miR-206, we constructed two dual-luciferase reporters by inserting perfect miR-1a-3p or miR-206 target sites into the 3’ end of Renilla luciferase. The knockdown potential of the miRNA was assessed by the presence or absence of circRBFOX2s. After co-transfecting the dual-luciferase reporter with their corresponding miRNAs, the relative luminescence was significantly decreased compared with miR-NC. However, the relative luminescence returned when co-transfected with either circRBFOX2.2-3 or circRBFOX2.2-4 expression vectors, but not the mutated vectors of circRBFOX2s (Fig. 6C and D). These results demonstrated that the knockdown potential of miR-1a-3p or miR-206 was significantly diminished in the presence of circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4. Immunoprecipitation of AGO2 from myoblasts co-transfected with miR-1a-3p, miR-206 or miR-203 and circRBFOX2 overexpression vector was performed and the circRNA levels were quantified by qRT–PCR and normalized to GAPDH (Fig. 6A). Compared with miR-203 transfected cells, immunoprecipitation of AGO2 from miR-1a-3p or miR-206 transfected cells were both resulted in an enrichment of circRBFOX2. In addition, compared with miR-203 control, circRBFOX2.2-4 was specifically captured by both 3-biotinylated miR-1a-3p and miR-206, and circRBFOX2.2-3 was also captured by 3-biotinylated miR-206. Together, these results suggested that circRBFOX2s are able to interact with miR-1a-3p and miR-206. CircRBFOX2s interacted with miR-206 and miR-1a-3p.

Effects of circRBFOX2 on expression of miRNAs and their target genesWe over expressed or knocked down circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 in chicken primary myoblast, and then measured miR-1°-3p and miR-206 expression levels by qRT-PCR. We constructed the pcDNA3.1 vector with linear exon2-3 or exon2-4 of RBFOX2 as control, which give rise to linear RBFOX2 products. We transfected these linear control vector in myoblast and then the miR-206/miR-1a-3p level were quantified by qRT-PCR. The results showed that linear RBFOX2 did not affect the expression of miR-206 and miR-1a-3p (Fig. 7A). Effects of circRBFOX2 on expression of miRNAs and their target gene.

Student’s t test (two-tailed) was performed for data analysis. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01.Compared to empty vector control, overexpressed circRBFOX2.2-3 or circRBFOX2.2-4 inhibited both miR-1a-3p and miR-206, while the mutation of circRBFOX2 vector did not have significant change (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, the expression level of miR-206/miR-1a-3p tend to be lower when the level of circRBFOX2s higher (Fig. 7C). We knock down circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 using siRNAs, and the results showed that the siRNAs could knockdown the circRBFOX2s but not linear RBFOX2. Knockdown of either circRBFOX2.2-3 or circRBFOX2.2-4 increased both the expression of miR-1a-3p and miR-206 (Fig. 7D). Northern blot analysis for miR-206 was also confirmed that the miR-206 expression level was increased by knockdown of circRBFOX2s (Fig. 7H). The expression of miR-203 used as control did not affect by neither overexpressed nor knockdown of circRBFOX2s. Together, our results found that circRBFOX2s downregulated the expression of miR-1a-3p and miR-206. This finding was not consisted with the standard model of circRNA miRNA sponge. The circRNAs that act as miRNA sponge can sequesters the miRNA away from other targets, but does not necessarily alter the expression of the miRNA. Recently, there are some circRNAs, such as CircRar1, circ-ABCB10 and hsa-circ-0016347 were also reported to downregulated the expression of their target miRNA.55–57 However, the exact mechanism for this association is unknown, probably upregulation of circRNAs might degrade miRNA expression.We further validated whether circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 regulated the target gene of miR-206. According to previous studies and predicted by Targetsclan (http://www.targetscan.org/vert_71/ (16 September 2017, date last accessed)), we chose the CCND1, CCND2, PAX3 and HDAC4 as candidate target gene for miR-206, and then verified their relations by luciferase assay.58–60 The CCND2 and HDAC4 were confirmed as the target gene of miR-206 (Fig. 7A). Thus, we further determine their expression level after overexpression/knockdown of circRBFOX2s in myoblast. The results showed that both circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 upregulated the mRNA level of CCND2 but not HDAC4 (Fig. 7F and G).3.7. Effects of circRBFOX2 and miR-206 on myoblast proliferationTo observe the functions of circRBFOX2.2-3 or circRBFOX2.2-4 on myoblast, we over expressed and knocked down the circRBFOX2.2-3 or circRBFOX2.2-4 by transfected with overexpression vector or siRNAs. Overexpression of either circRBFOX2.2-3 or circRBFOX2.2-4 resulted in increased levels of circRBFOX2.2-3 or circRBFOX2.2-4 above that of the empty vector control (Fig. 8A and B). Similarly, when we transfected circRBFOX2.2-3 or circRBFOX2.2-4 siRNAs, the transcript levels of both these RNAs decreased (Fig. 8C and D). These results indicated that our expression system worked in myoblasts. We used flow cytometry for cell cycle analysis of transfected myoblasts. Overexpression of circRBFOX2.2-3 resulted in a greater number of S-phase cells than controls, and fewer G0/G1 cells (Fig. 8E and F, Supplementary Figs S7 and S8). Both the mutated vector of circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 did not affect the cell cycle of myoblast. Knockdown of circRBFOX2.2-3 resulted in a greater number of G0/G1 cells and fewer S and G2/M phase cells than controls. However, the circRBFOX2.2-4 knockdown and overexpression groups showed significant differences only in S-phase (Fig. 8E and F, Supplementary Figs S7 and S8). The 5-Ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assays were also performed after over expressed and knocked down the circRBFOX2.2-3 or circRBFOX2.2-4 in myoblast. The number of EdU-stained cells increased in both the circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 overexpression groups. In contrast, proliferation decreased when circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 were knocked down (Fig. 8G and H). Chicken circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 regulate QM-7 cell proliferation.

We overexpressed and knocked down miR-206 by transfecting myoblasts with a miR-206 mimic or anti-miR-206 (Fig. 9A and B). Myoblasts transfected with the miR-206 mimic decreased the number of S-phase cells compared with the scrambled negative control group (Fig. 9C). Conversely, S-phase cells in the anti-miR-206 group were significantly increased (Fig. 9D). Consistent with the result of cell cycle analysis, EdU incorporation indicated that myoblast proliferation was suppressed by miR-206 overexpression and increased by miR-206 knockdown (Fig. 9A and F). Interestingly, the effects of miR-206 on myoblast proliferation was impaired when either circRBFOX2.2-3 or circRBFOX2.2-4 vectors were co-transfected (Fig. 9E and F). Together, these data implied that miR-206 could suppress myoblast proliferation, whereas circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 can promote myoblast proliferation, and antagonize the functions of miR-206 in myoblasts. Our results support previous findings that circRNAs sequester miRNAs to suppress their functions in chickens. Nevertheless, only a few circRNAs that function in this manner have been described. Some reports argue that most circRNAs do not function as miRNA sponges in human and mouse.20,61,62 Whether this mechanism is a common theme in circRNA biology awaits future research. The effect of miR-206 on QM-7 cell proliferation was rescued by circRBFOX2s.

Most of the exonic circRNAs harbored miRNA binding sites and could play key roles in embryonic muscle development through sequestering miRNAs as well as other functions.We thank Prof. Zhang’s lab members for helpful discussions and the SCAU chicken farm for providing breeding eggs.Accession numbersRNA-seq data are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with accession number (GSE89355).Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.FundingThis research was supported by the Natural Scientific Foundation of China (31472090), the China Agriculture Research System (CARS-41-G03), and the Foundation for High-level Talents in Higher Education in Guangdong, China.Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary data"

IntroductionThe fungal family Botryosphaeriaceae (Ascomycetes) includes saprobes, endophytes and phytopathogens.1–4 Members of this family are among the most widely geographically distributed opportunistic plant pathogens4 with an extensive host range, infecting many economically important plants worldwide.1–5 These pathogens can establish successful infections via wounds or natural openings, such as lenticels and stomata.2,3 Once inside the host tissues, they may remain latent, live as endophytes and then shift into pathogens when the host is stressed. Hence, taxa in this family have been described as latent pathogens or plant opportunistic fungal pathogens.4,5 These pathogens can cause serious diseases, such as dieback, cankers, shoot blights, leaf spots, fruit and seed rots, and witches’ brooms, in a broad range of woody plants.1,2,5 This shift from an endophyte to a pathogen is related to host biochemical and epigenetic changes in response to environmental stresses.4,5Among the currently accepted 23 genera of Botryosphaeriaceae, Botryosphaeria Ces. & De Not., Diplodia Fr., Lasiodiplodia Ellis & Everh. and Neofusicoccum Crous, Slippers & A.J.L. Phillips are considered the most virulent.1,2 These botryosphaeriaceous pathogens attack the perennial organs of important woody plants, including apples, eucalyptus, grapes, peaches, pears and poplars, compromising the translocation of water and nutrients, and ultimately leading to death.3,5 To establish a successful infection, these woody pathogens overcome both preformed and inducible host defences by producing enzymes and/or toxins.5–10 During the last decade, several studies have confirmed the functions and effects of virulence factors, such as cell wall–degrading enzymes, effectors, secreted proteins and phytotoxins of these pathogens on their hosts.3–11 For example, most of these botryosphaeriaceous pathogens produce a wide array of secreted proteins that target the components in the primary and secondary cell walls of plants, such as endo-ß-1,4-cellulases [glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GH5)], ß-glucosidases (GH3), xyloglucan transglucosylase/hydrolases (GH16) and ß-xylosidases (GH43).3,5,7 These glycosyl hydrolase family proteins assist in the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in complex sugars and are involved in diverse functions, including the degradation of biomass, antibacterial defence strategies, pathogenesis mechanisms and a few typical cellular functions.12,13 Even though this knowledge can be used to identify proteins related to pathogenesis and virulence, a better understanding of their potential virulence functions is required to develop effective disease management strategies.Although many genomic and transcriptomic studies have been conducted for different phytopathogens, only a few have focused on botryosphaeriaceous pathogens. These genomic studies, combined with transcriptome analyses, have significantly advanced our knowledge on the pathogenesis of these organisms. Recent studies on common botryosphaeriaceous woody plant pathogens have presented draft genomes for Diplodia sapinea,14,Diplodia seriata3 and Neofusicoccum parvum.11 Functional annotation of sequenced genomes has provided a wide range of potential virulence factors, many of which are associated with lignocellulose degradation, host colonization, cellular transporters, nutrient uptake, secondary metabolism and toxin production. Some of the virulence genes predicted by Morales-Cruz et al.3 and Paolinelli-Alfonso et al.5 have been identified as virulence factors in other fungal pathogens, such as Eutypa lata, Phaeoacremonium aleophilum, Phytophthora sp. and Togninia minima.11,15,16 Although single-genome analysis facilitates better insights into the biology of a pathogen, comparative analysis of multiple genomes can often reveal a significantly greater amount of information on the physiology and evolution of a pathogen.17 Indeed, comparative genomic analyses of related taxa have facilitated the identification of both unique and shared genes and pathways related to virulence in fungal pathogens.In this study, we sequenced and analysed the genomes of three botryosphaeriaceous pathogens, Botryosphaeria dothidea, Lasiodiplodia theobromae and N.parvum. Of these, L. theobromae has been recorded as the most virulent on grapes in China. Compared with L. theobromae, N. parvum and B. dothidea are considered to be mildly virulent and weakly virulent, respectively, on grapes in China.2 The main objectives of this study were to (i) identify the genomic characteristics of these fungi, (ii) understand the genetic variation among the sequenced species and genera, (iii) identify genes or gene families involved in virulence, with a special focus on genes that are unique to each of these genera, as well as those shared among these genera, and (iv) understand the opportunistic infections identified in these genera. Whole-genome, transcriptome and comparative genome analyses revealed that their genomes encode a diverse range of genes related to virulence, including carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), peroxidases, cytochrome P450s, effector proteins, transcription factor genes and genes involved in secondary metabolism. Our analyses identified obvious expansion of gene families related to transporters and the synthesis of secondary metabolites in Botryosphaeriaceae. We also identified different infection strategies utilized by L. theobromae to adapt to different lifestyles. Functional characterization of several genes confirmed their roles in pathogenicity as candidate virulence factors. Our study provides a solid foundation from which to explore the molecular processes responsible for virulence in L. theobromae as well as in other botryosphaeriaceous taxa.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strains, culture conditions and DNA isolationFungal strains were collected from Vitis vinifera in different provinces and used for sequencing (see Supplementary Table S1). The strains were deposited at the Beijing Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, China. Cultures were grown in potato dextrose agar (PDA: 200 g potato, 20 g dextrose and 20 g agar) medium at 28 °C and stored at -80 °C. Total DNA was isolated from the collected mycelium using the Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method.182.2. Genome sequencing and assemblyThe genomic DNA of L.theobromae CSS-01s was sequenced with the Illumina platforms at the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) in Shenzhen, China, and a 500-bp paired-end DNA library and a 6-kb mate-pair DNA library were constructed. Data from the Illumina libraries were first filtered by removing low-quality sequences, base-calling duplicates and adaptor contamination. A total of 3.1 Gb of paired-end reads, with an average read length of 90 bp and a sequencing coverage of approximately 90×, was achieved for L. theobromae strain CSS-01s. The genome sequence was assembled using SOAPdenovo software. First, short reads from the paired-end library (500 bp) were assembled into contigs using sequence overlap information. Then, information from the mate-pair library was used to join the contigs into scaffolds. Finally, SOAP Gapcloser version 1.12 (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapdenovo.html (10 May 2016, date last accessed)) was used to close the gaps inside the scaffolds.Two other botryosphaeriaceous taxa (B. dothidea and N. parvum) with two isolates for each species and another L. theobromae isolate (Supplementary Table S1) were subjected to low-depth sequencing. Genomic DNA extracted from all of the above isolates was sequenced using Solexa sequencing technology (Beijing Novo Gene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China). These libraries, with 500-bp inserts, were assembled using SOAPdenovo software (Supplementary Table S2).2.3. Transcriptome sequencing and analysesLasiodiplodia theobromae conidial suspension (1 ml, 1 × 105 conidial·ml-1) was inoculated onto the 27 wounded stems of V.vinifera var. Summer Black and maintained at two temperatures (25 °C and 35 °C) for 48 h in the green house at Beijing Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, China. Wounded stems inoculated with sterile water were maintained as controls at the same conditions. Simultaneously, L. theobromae cultures were maintained on PDA at same conditions. Then, infected host and fungal samples were collected from hosts at 8- and 12-h post-inoculation (hpi) at 25 °C. Simultaneously, fungal mycelia were collected from PDA at 8- and 12-h post-culturing at both temperatures. All the collected samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -70 °C for RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated from in vitro cultures and from diseased samples using Trizol according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, USA). Total RNA from nine stems with three biological replicates for each sample at 8 and 12 hpi were used for library construction. All procedures including mRNA purification, cDNA preparation, end repair of cDNA, adapter ligation and cDNA amplification were carried out by following Novo gene company methodologies for preparing Illumina RNASeq libraries. The paired-end reads with 150 bp were generated via Illumina HiSeq™ by Novogene company. All the sequence data were filtered to remove adaptor sequences and low-quality sequences. The quality trimmed reads were mapped to L. theobromae genome using Botwie2, allowing up to two base mismatches per read. The reads per kb per million reads was calculated to reflect the expression level. The differentially expressed analysis was done by DESeq and DEGseq software. In addition, RNASeq data assembled by Trinity were used to confirm the completeness of the draft genome of L. theobromae strain CSS-01s. RNASeq reads were assembled into 24,537 contigs longer than 300 bp, and all the contigs were then searched using blast against the L. theobromae genome.2.4. Annotation of repetitive elementsThe Tandem Repeats Finder19 was used to search for tandem repeats in the L. theobromae genome. Transposable elements were predicted by combining the results from RepeatMasker (version 4.0), RepeatProteinMasker (version 4.0) and RepeatModeler version (1.0.4).20 Homology-based discovery of transposable elements was conducted by RepeatMasker and RepeatProteinMasker against the sequences in the RepBase database version 19.10 (RM database version 20140131). RepeatModeler integrated two de novo repeat finding programs, RECON (version 1.08)21 and RepeatScout (version 1.0.5),20 to identify repeat element boundaries and family relationships from the sequence data.2.5. Annotation of protein-coding genesProtein-coding genes in L. theobromae strain CSS-01s were identified by integrating ab initio prediction with homology-based gene prediction and transcriptome sequencing approaches. Repeat sequences were masked throughout the genome by RepeatModeler and RepeatMasker. Then, gene models were predicted from these repeat-masked genomes using three ab initio predictors, Augustus (version 3.0.3),22 SNAP23 and GeneMark-ES (version 2.3f)24. The accuracy of the ab initio annotation was improved using the proteomes of ten other fungi (Alternaria brassicicola, Aspergillus fumigatus, Blumeria graminis, Colletotrichum graminicola, C. higginsianum, Fusarium graminearum, Neurospora crassa, Pyricularia oryzae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe) and the RNASeq data. These 10 downloaded fungal proteomes were aligned to the L. theobromae genome by genBlastA (version 1.0.4). Proteins with more than 70% sequence identity were used as templates to predict the gene structure of L. theobromae with Genewise (version 2.4.1).25 Then, predicted genes with incomplete open reading frames were removed. The RNASeq data were aligned to the L. theobromae genome by TopHat (version 2.0.11),26 and potential transcripts in the L. theobromae genome were predicted using Cufflinks (version 2.2.1).27 TransDecoder (version 2.0.1) was used to identify candidate coding regions within the predicted transcript sequences. Finally, all the outputs of the above methods were converted to Gene Finding Format (GFF) files with local PERL scripts. The resultant GFF files from each of the prediction programs were used as inputs into the EVM (version 2012-06-25) program to integrate GFF files obtained from the three gene prediction methods. Homology gene prediction was used to predict genes in five other sequenced botryosphaeriaceous taxa as listed in Supplementary Table S1, using the predicted genes of L. theobromae CSS-01s as templates.2.6. Functional annotation of predicted genesBasic functional annotations of all predicted proteins were searched against the NCBI non-redundant sequence database and UniProt/Swiss-Prot databases under the threshold parameter of E-value cut-off =1e-5. Secreted proteins were predicted using a combination of tools. Potential secreted proteins should contain a signal peptide without any transmembrane domain. The availability of a secretion signal peptide evaluated by both SignalP (version 4.1)28 and TargetP (version 1.1),29 and the unavailability of a transmembrane domain predicted by TMHMM (version 2.0)30 were used to define potential secreted proteins. SignalP predicts the presence of signal peptide cleavage sites and their locations in the amino acid sequence. TargetP predicts the subcellular location of eukaryotic proteins based on the predicted presence of any N-terminal pre-sequences such as chloroplast transit peptides, mitochondrial targeting peptides or secretory pathway signal peptides. Among the predicted secretory proteins, secreted proteins =400 amino-acids in size and with =4 cysteine residues were defined as putative effectors.Searches against the protein family database PFAM and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation of each genome were performed using InterProScan (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/pfa/iprscan5/ (1 June 2016, date last accessed)) analysis. Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation was performed to assign molecular interaction networks and metabolic pathways using the online KEGG Automatic Annotation Server (KAAS) (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/kaas/ (1 June 2016, date last accessed)). The transcription factors in the genome were annotated by mapping the IPRSCAN terms to the Fungal Transcription Factor database (http://ftfd.snu.ac.kr/tf.php?a=interpro (10 June 2016, date last accessed)), and transporters were annotated by searching against the TCDB database.The family-specific HMM profiles of CAZymes were downloaded from the dbCAN database, and the hmmscan program in the HMMER 3.0 package31 was used to search the fungal proteomes against the downloaded HMM profiles. Then, the primary results were parsed by the hmmscan-parser scripts supplied by the dbCAN database.2.7. Comparative genomicsThe protein sequences of the L. theobromae CSS-01s genome were compared with the protein sequences of 10 other fungi genomes, including five pathogenic taxa (Blumeria graminis, Colletotrichum graminicola, C. higginsianum, F.graminearum and P.oryzae), two opportunistic pathogens (A.brassicicola and A.fumigatus) and three non-pathogenic fungi (N.crassa, S.cerevisiae and S.pombe), as well as five other isolates of the Botryosphaeriaceae family.32,33 OrthoMCL (version 2.0)34 was used to find the orthologues, co-orthologues and in-paralogue pairs (Supplementary Table S3), as well as reciprocal best hits for each proteome. The tools were executed with an E-value <10-5 with the All-versus-All BLASTP search and the inflation parameter 2.0 in the MCL algorithm.2.8. Ka/Ks calculationFor Ka/Ks calculation, 1:1 orthologous genes were identified among each isolate pair of each Botryosphaeriaceae species. Subsequently, the proteins between the two isolates were aligned in MUSCLE (version 3.8) using the default parameters and then converted to the corresponding nucleotide sequence alignment. The FASTA files containing the aligned sequences were converted into AXT files by a local PERL script, and the ratios of Ka and Ks were calculated between orthologous coding regions with Ka/Ks_Calculator v2.0 using a maximum-likelihood YN model.2.9. Divergence time estimateOrthoMCL was used to identify 1,029 single-copy gene families. The proteins of these single-copy gene families were aligned using MAFFT (version 7.187) with the default parameters and then converted to the corresponding nucleotide sequence alignment. A phylogenomic tree was constructed using MEGA7 based on the concatenated alignments of these 1,029 single-copy orthologous families. The phylogenomic tree consists of 15 other fungal taxa including eight pathogenic taxa (Blumeria graminis, Botrytis cinera, Colletotrichum graminicola, C. higginsianum, D.seriata, E.lata, Fusarium graminearum and Pyricularia oryzae), three opportunistic pathogens (Alternaria alternata, Alternaria brassicicola and Aspergillus fumigatus) and three non-pathogenic fungi (Neurospora crassa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S.pombe), as well as five other isolates of the Botryosphaeriaceae family. Bootstrap support for internal branches was evaluated from 1,000 full heuristic searches. Divergence times between species were calculated using the MCMC tree program in the PAML.2.10. Functional studies on putative effector proteinsTo understand the functions of these putative effector genes identified from the current study, 27 randomly selected effectors, of which 18 are specific, were translocated into plant cells to identify effectors that suppress hypersensitive responses (HRs) in the host. These putative effector genes (without signal peptide regions) of Botryosphaeriaceae were amplified using the primer sets listed in Supplementary Table S4. The PCR products were digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes and subcloned into effector detector vector (pEDV).35,Burkholderia glumae competent cells were prepared as described, with minor modifications.36 Each pEDV construct was transformed into B. glumae using electroporation (Bio-Rad MicroPulserTM). Transformed strains were spread on LB agar medium containing 25 mg·l-1 gentamycin. At least four glycerol stocks were prepared for each transformant and stored at -80 °C for further use. Leaves of 4-week-old Nicotiana benthamiana plants were infiltrated with bacterial inocula of OD600=0.1 using a 1 ml needleless syringe. A half-section of each leaf was injected with B. glumae containing the pEDV empty vector, and the other half-section was injected with B. glumae containing the effector gene construct. Plants were maintained at 25 °C. The timing of the hyposensitive responses was recorded at 2 days post-inoculation.2.11. Functional studies on putative lignocellulase encoding genesMaximum parsimony analysis was conducted for all the annotated glycosyl hydrolase family genes in PAUP (phylogenetic analysis using parsimony) v.4.0b1037 using heuristic search option with tree bisection–reconnection branch swapping and 1,000 random sequence additions. The full-length coding sequences of candidate genes were isolated by PCR using the specific primers listed in Supplementary Table S4. The PCR products were digested with HindIII and EcoRI and inserted into the same sites behind the PtrpC promoter in a modified pBluescript II KS vector. The wild-type isolate, CSS-01s, was cultured at 28 °C on PDA plates. Mycelia collected from the culture were used to isolate fungal genomic DNA and protoplasts. Protoplasts were isolated and transformed using the PEG/CaCl2 method.38 Selection medium was supplemented with 1,100 µg/ml neomycin (Amresco, USA) to screen for neomycin-resistant transformants. Putative overexpression mutants were identified by PCR and further confirmed by qRT-PCR. Pathogenicity tests were conducted on detached ‘Summer Black’ grape shoots as described previously.2 The inoculated shoots were maintained on an alternating dark/light cycle under moist conditions in the greenhouse for 8–10 days at 25 °C. All treatments were performed with at least five replicates, and all experiments were repeated three times. Data were analysed by Student’s t-test using SAS software.3. Results3.1. Genome sequencing, assembly and annotationThe genome of the highly virulent L.theobromae strain CSS-01s (as shown in Fig. 1A) was assembled using sequencing data generated by Illumina technology (Supplementary Table S2). Approximately 342 million Illumina reads (~90× coverage of the genome) were used for assembly in SOAPdenovo software, resulting in a genome sequence of 43.3 Mb. The assembled genome accounts for 95.7% of the total genome size (~45.2 Mb), as estimated by JELLYFISH (Supplementary Fig. S1).39 The current genome assembly of L. theobromae strain CSS-01s consists of 29 scaffolds (= 1 kb) and 60 contigs with N50 lengths of 4.7 and 1.7 Mb, respectively. The overall GC content of the L. theobromae genome is approximately 54.77%. Furthermore, all RNASeq reads were assembled into 24,210 contigs longer than 300 bp, and 95.8% of these aligned with the predicted gene models, confirming the completeness and accuracy of the genome assembly. Compared with the virulence of L. theobromae, N.parvum and B.dothidea were mildly virulent and weakly virulent, respectively, in China (Fig. 1A). The genome assembly results for all botryosphaeriaceous isolates are shown in Table 1.

The red dots are the fossil calibrations from the Time Tree database.Integrated data from the ab initio prediction, homology-based search and RNASeq facilitated the prediction of 12,902 high-confidence protein-coding genes in L. theobromae (CSS-01s), with an average sequence length of 1,629 bp. The number of predicted genes in the L. theobromae genome is similar to those in other fungal genomes (Supplementary Table S5). On average, each predicted gene contains 2.8 exons, with 9,902 of the predicted genes containing introns. The coding regions of these predicted genes constitute 43.6% of the genome. The genomic features for L. theobromae CSS-01s is shown in Table 2. The genome features of the other five Botryosphaeriaceae isolates are shown in Supplementary Table S6. Genome features of L. theobromae CSS-01SGenome features of L. theobromae CSS-01SThe predicted genes were further annotated based on comparisons with several databases, as indicated in Supplementary Table S7. An interproScan analysis identified 7,733 proteins belonging to 3,570 protein families in L. theobromae. Functional annotation showed that among the 12,902 predicted genes, 7,149 (55.4%) could be assigned with GO terms (Supplementary Fig. 2), and 5,520 genes could be mapped to the KEGG pathway database. Our analyses predicted 937 secreted proteins, accounting for 6.9% of the proteome, with 359 proteins identified as potential effectors. Similar numbers of secreted proteins were found in D.seriata3 (910) and N.parvum11 (1097). However, the corresponding number of secreted proteins found in the Pyricularia oryzae32 (739), Valsa mali40 (782) and V. pyri40 (774) genomes were lower than that of L. theobromae. Of all the secreted proteins identified, 269 (including 101 potential effectors) were specific to L. theobromae. Among the protein-coding genes revealed by the different annotation systems, the major functional groups in L. theobromae include degrading CAZymes (820 genes, of which 198 are specific to L. theobromae), cellular transporters (2,419 genes, of which 307 are specific), transcription factors (528 genes, of which 118 are specific) and secondary metabolites (54 genes, none were specific) (see Fig. 2C and D). Genome synteny analysis revealed an overall correlation between the homologous chromosomes of the six isolates (Supplementary Fig. S3). Repetitive elements identified in this study are shown in Supplementary Table S8. Overview of the gene family size comparison between the L. theobromae (CSS-01s) and other fungi.

Selection pressures on orthologues of L. theobromae and other botryosphaeriaceous isolatesAdaptive evolution is often associated with changes in protein-coding genes in the genome41, and the Ka/Ks ratio is commonly used to reveal the direction and magnitude of selection upon these genes. Among the orthologous pairs between the L. theobromae strains, there were significant divergences for 809 orthologues. The Ka and Ks rates as well as their ratios were all calculated (Supplementary Fig. S4). Among these, four pairs of orthologues have Ka/Ks ratios > 1, and 13 have Ka/Ks rates ranging from 0.5 to 1. The Ka/Ks ratios between L. theobromae CSS-01s and the four other isolates of botryosphaeriaceous taxa are listed in Supplementary Table S9. Orthologous pairs with a Ka/Ks value > 1 indicate positive selection, whereas Ka/Ks value between 0.5 and 1 indicate weak purifying selection. Interestingly, all four genes (evm.model.scaffold_15.78, evm.model.scaffold_4.947, evm.model.scaffold_9.354 and evm.model.scaffold_9.168) showing positive selection were newly discovered genes with unknown functions. However, two of the genes have similar sequences in N. parvum11 and Macrophoma phaseolina42. The similar gene found in N. parvum contains a W40 domain with a wide variety of functions involved in regulatory modules in signal transduction, pre-mRNA processing and cytoskeleton assembly.113.3. Comparative genomics and evolutionComparative genomics revealed a broad range of gene families available in the genome with potential functions related to virulence. In addition to the six botryosphaeriaceous isolates sequenced in this study, 15 other fungal genomes were also included for comparative analyses.32,33 These taxa includes pathogens, opportunistic pathogens and non-pathogenic fungi. According to the analysis, these species shared 1,029 single-copy orthologous groups. Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1B) revealed that the species belonging to Botryosphaeriaceae are more closely related to A. brassicicola and A. alternata, than to the other taxa. This is acceptable, because they all belong to the same class, Dothideomycetes. When compared with all other genomes, 2,813 gene families containing 1,129 species-specific groups (1,156 genes) were found to be specific to Botryosphaeriaceae, most of which were single-copy genes (Fig. 2A and B). These genes are enriched in cytochrome P450s and GO functional categories, such as hydrolase activity, lyase activity, metabolic processes, oxidation-reduction processes, oxidoreductase activity, iron ion binding, heme binding and transporter activity (FDR <0.05, Supplementary Table S10).Based on their lifestyles, botryosphaeriaceous taxa share 221 unique orthologous gene families with pathogenic fungi, 1,049 with opportunistic fungal pathogens and 36 with non-pathogenic fungi (Fig. 2A and B). Orthologous families shared between pathogenic fungi and Botryosphaeriaceae are enriched in phosphorylation, signal transduction and enzyme inhibitor activity functions (FDR <0.05, Supplementary Table S11), whereas no significant functional enrichment was found in the gene families shared between the non-pathogenic taxa and botryosphaeriaceous taxa. Among all other fungal groups, Botryosphaeriaceae taxa shared the most orthologous gene families (1,049) with opportunistic fungal pathogens (Fig. 2A and B), with enriched hydrolase, catalytic, cellulose binding, oxidoreductase, transmembrane transporter, and transcription factor activities, among many others (FDR <0.05, see Supplementary Table S12). These genes are mainly involved in the metabolism of starch, sucrose, fructose and mannose, as well as secondary metabolite synthesis.3.4. Gene family expansions and contractionsThe expansion of gene families in fungal genomes is mainly associated with host adaptations5,43 and functions linked to virulence, such as host cell wall degradation, transport functions and secondary metabolite synthesis.5,44 This study used the Computational Analysis of gene Family Evolution (CAFÉ)45 program to identify gene families that have potentially undergone significant expansions or contractions in botryosphaeriaceous taxa. When compared with all other fungal genomes analysed in this study, five gene families (51 genes) in L. theobromae have significantly expanded (P =0.05, Supplementary Table S13), whereas one family has contracted. According to Clusters of Orthologous Group (COG) annotation, these expanded gene families in botryosphaeriaceous taxa are functionally related to secondary metabolism, plant cell wall degradation and cellular transporters such as non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), cytochrome P450, polyketide synthase (PKS), ATP-binding cassette (ABC)–type multidrug transport system, ATPase component, and sulphite reductase and alpha subunit (flavoprotein).3.5. Secondary metabolism genesSecondary metabolites are believed to be involved in the development of certain disease symptoms and, in some cases, cause the host to die.5,6,46 Genes encoding a biosynthetic pathway are co-regulated at the transcriptional level and are often physically clustered on fungal chromosomes.46 A biosynthetic gene is often surrounded by genes encoding transporters and others involved in post-synthesis modification of the metabolite.46,47 In this study, two computational programs, SMURF (http://jcvi.org/smurf/index.php (20 June 2016, date last accessed))48 and antiSAMSH (http://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/ (20 June 2016, date last accessed)),49 were used to identify genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. The L. theobromae genome contains a total of 58 secondary metabolite gene clusters, categorized into eight main groups. The majority of the clusters belong to type 1 polyketide synthases (t1 PKS, 11 clusters), followed by 12 non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), 10 terpene synthases, four non-ribosomal peptide synthetase–t1 PKS hybrids, three putative fatty acid clusters, a type 1 PKS-non-ribosomal peptide synthetase hybrid, a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase–putative fatty acid hybrid and another putative saccharide cluster. In addition to these eight known clusters, there were nine other clusters encoding secondary metabolite related proteins.3.6. Host-pathogen interactions revealed during infectionA comprehensive understanding of the L. theobromae transcriptome should significantly facilitate the discovery of new genes and their expression profiles. To understand pathogenicity-related genes, the transcript profiles of L. theobromae in V.vinifera were analysed at two early infection stages (Fig. 3A). When compared with axenic cultures, 75 and 283 genes were up-regulated, whereas 89 and 232 genes were down-regulated, at 8 and 12 hpi, respectively (Fig. 3C). During the early infection stages of L. theobromae, a total of 285 up-regulated genes and 243 down-regulated genes were identified. Among these genes, genes that exhibited significant expression during infection are listed in Supplementary Tables S14 and S15. According to GO enrichment analysis, the up-regulated genes at 8 hpi were enriched in molecular function and biological process terms, concentrated in ferric iron binding, the hydrolysis of O-glycosyl compounds and polygalacturonase activity. However, more genes were up-regulated at 12 hpi than at 8 hpi. At 12 hpi, most of the up-regulated genes were involved in pectin degradation, polygalacturonase activities and carbohydrate catabolic processes. This finding indicates that during infection, these up-regulated genes facilitate the degradation of cell walls by L. theobromae. KEGG pathway analysis confirmed that the genes up-regulated at 8 and 12 hpi were significantly enriched in starch and sucrose metabolism pathways, as well as in the pentose and glucuronate interconversion pathways.

L indicates samples collected from axenic cultures, M indicates samples of fungus and host tissues. Two different temperatures of 25 °C and 35 °C indicated by numbers 25 and 35. Two sample collection time points were indicated by 8 and 12 hpi.From a total of 75 genes up-regulated at 8 hpi, 40 were secreted proteins, of which 20 were predicted to be putative effectors. Among the 283 up-regulated genes at 12 hpi, 119 were secreted proteins, of which 51 were predicted to be putative effectors. These putative effectors contain conserved functional domains such as glycoside hydrolase, pectate lyase or fungal-specific extracellular EGF-like domains (CFEM) to enhance their invasion and pathogenesis. Unlike in other pathogenic taxa,42 secondary metabolism genes were not up-regulated at both 8 and 12 hpi.3.7. Expansion and expression of membrane transportersAmong the wide array of membrane transporters, two main families are abundant in fungal genomes, the ABC family and the major facilitator super (MFS) family.50 The L. theobromae genome encodes 917 membrane transporters. Searches against the transporter classification database confirm that L. theobromae has the largest number of membrane transporters compared with the other taxa (Supplementary Table S16). The number of membrane transporters in the L. theobromae genome is similar to that in A. fumigatus. Several membrane transporters in the L. theobromae genome are significantly expanded, including amino acid/choline transporters, anion:cation symporters, sugar porters, drug:H+ antiporter-2, multidrug resistance exporters (a.k.a. ABCB) and the pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) transporters (Fig. 4A). Upon host contact, 17 membrane transporters were significantly up-regulated, including amino acid transporters, PDRs, sugar porters and triose-phosphate transporters. The multidrug resistance proteins in the PDR family confer resistance to cycloheximide and antifungal agents such as azoles and terbinafine51, and both were up-regulated. Two genes in the sugar porter family were significantly up-regulated; one of the two genes is a glucose/xylose: H+ symporter and the other is an MFS permease. These sugar transporters may allow the fungus to grow under different pH conditions.52Gene family expansions and contractions of L. theobromae, and up-regulation of gene expressions during infection.

Lasiodiplodia theobromae secretomeProteins secreted by pathogenic fungi are essential for host–pathogen interactions, including the successful establishment of infections.53 Therefore, identification and functional annotation of the secretome is important for identifying potential virulence factors. The L. theobromae genome encodes a total of 937 secreted proteins, accounting for 7.2% of its proteome, as predicted by SignalP-4.1,28 TargetP-1.1,54 and TMHMM-2.0.55 Among the secreted proteins identified, 417 were assigned with GO terms. Among the 283 genes up-regulated during infection, 105 are secreted proteins. Functional enrichment analysis showed that proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism are significantly overrepresented in the up-regulated L. theobromae secretome (Supplementary Table S17).3.9. Prediction of putative effectors and their roles in suppressing HRsPlant pathogenic fungi secrete effectors that suppress the first layer of inducible defences, known as pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered immunity, which detects conserved pathogen molecules, such as flagellin, Elongation Factor Thermo unstable, peptidoglycan and chitin by host receptors.56 However, very little is known about the effector proteins that contribute to Botryosphaeriaceae virulence. Among the 937 secreted proteins predicted from the L. theobromae genome, we identified 359 putative effectors. Searches for conserved motifs among these effectors showed that 157 contain Y/F/WxC motifs, 45 contain L/IxAR motifs, 1 contains YxSL[R/K] motifs, and 13 contain a single RxLR motif each. Among these, 77 putative effectors were specific to L. theobromae. Five effectors (BR_1.280, BR_2.1361, BR_2.1420, BR_4.711 and BR_10.166) exhibited a strong suppressive effect, whereas BR_1.397, BR_1.899 and BR_5.292 had a weak effect in N. benthamiana (Fig. 5). Two of the effectors, BR_1.280 and BR_2.1361, encode hypothetical proteins (Fig. 5). These results significantly expand our understanding of the determinants of pathogenicity or virulence in Botryosphaeriaceae. Putative effectors and their hypersensitive responses in N. benthamiana.

Potential adaptations of the L. theobromae genome and transcriptome for plant cell wall degradationPhytopathogenic fungi encode many CAZymes. During colonization and infection, CAZymes play an important role in the disassembly of plant cell walls, including the breakdown, biosynthesis or modification of glycoconjugates and oligo- and polysaccharides.3,4 CAZymes are grouped into five classes (glycoside hydrolases, GH; glycosyl transferases, GT; polysaccharide lyases; carbohydrate esterases, CE and auxiliary activities, AA) and an associated module (carbohydrate-binding modules, CBMs).To understand the potential genes involved in the adaptation of L. theobromae to different habitats and substrates, we identified the repertoire of CAZymes known to be involved in organic matter degradation. A total of 820 CAZymes (mapped to 763 predicted L. theobromae genes) (Supplementary Table S18) were identified (see Fig. 2C). From the identified CAZymes, 10 (AA3, AA7, CBM18, CE1, CE10, GH109, GH3 GH43, GH78 and GT1) were expanded in the L. theobromae genome. Among the 283 genes up-regulated during infection, 66 are annotated as cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs), involved in lignin degeneration (6 genes), cellulose degeneration (11 genes), hemicellulose degeneration (8 genes) and pectin degeneration (13 genes) (Fig. 4B). GHs represented the largest super family involved in carbohydrate degradation processes.3,5 For a successful infection, pathogens must encode pectin degrading enzymes to break down plant pectin. The GH28 (polygalacturonases) family plays a critical role in pectin degradation in fungal pathogens such as C. higginsianum, V. mali and V. pyri5,40,57 and has expanded in the genomes of the two Valsa species.3 When compared with the other fungal genomes, the genome of L. theobromae has the most GH28 members (14 genes, of which 4 were up-regulated during infection), suggesting that L. theobromae has a high capacity for pectin degradation.Lignocellulose, which is composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, is one of the barriers that pathogens must surpass in order to colonize host tissues. Since L. theobromae is mainly a trunk pathogen, lignocellulose degrading enzymes likely play a major role during infection.4 Indeed, GH subfamilies involved in the degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose were the most abundant among all the fungal genomes. The degradation of cellulose requires the collaboration of endoglucanases (GH6, GH9, GH12, GH44, GH45, GH51, GH74, GH124, CBM65 and CBM72), cellobiohydrolases (GH6, GH7, GH19, GH48 and GH74) and ß-1,4-glucosidase (GH3). The L. theobromae genome encodes many of these CWDEs. Furthermore, among all the fungal pathogens studied, L. theobromae possesses the highest number of GH3s in its genome. Xylanases in the GH3 sub-family degrade xylan, and the L. theobromae genome contains a complete suite of enzymes to degrade xylan (Supplementary Fig. S5). During infection, three GH12, one GH7 and three GH3 genes encoding lignocellulose-degrading enzymes were up-regulated in L. theobromae, indicating their ability to effectively degrade cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Similar up-regulation of these genes were observed in L. theobromae.5 Compared with L. theobromae, the GH12 family is expanded in C. higginsianum, and similar CAZyme modules are available in L. theobromae, A. fumigatus and F. graminearum.3,5,6 Among the fungi analysed so far, the L. theobromae genome encodes the highest number of xyloglucan transglucosylases (GH16, 24 genes), followed by F. graminearum, C. higginsianum and C. graminicola. Endo-ß-1,4-cellulases (GH5) represent another gene family with a high number of encoded genes in L. theobromae, and these genes are commonly found in highly pathogenic species, such as E.lata and N. parvum.3,5,6 Our analyses identified the highest number of GH5s in C. higginsianum, followed by L. theobromae and C. graminicola.CBMs are an important gene family with carbohydrate binding activity.58 According to our comparative analysis, the highest number of CBMs was found in the highly pathogenic P. oryzae (99 genes), followed by C. graminicola (70 genes), C. higginsianum (80 genes), F. graminearum (68 genes) and L. theobromae (54 genes). In contrast, all the non-pathogenic species, including S. pombe (8 genes) and S. cerevisiae (8 genes), have fewer reported CBMs in their genomes.AAs are families of redox enzymes that act in conjunction with CAZymes to degrade lignocellulosic material. They represent ligninolytic enzymes and lytic polysaccharide mono-oxygenases involved in lignin breakdown.5,59 Our analyses found that both AA3 (38 genes) and AA7 (50 genes) families were expanded in the L. theobromae genome. The AA3 family is related to cellobiose dehydrogenase activity, and AA7 oxidizes glycosyl residues.59 These AA3 genes were also abundant in the N. parvum and Stereum hirsutum genomes.3 However, only one or two AA family genes were present in the non-pathogenic fungal genomes.3.11. Lasiodiplodia theobromae gene expression induced by infection and high temperature exhibits characteristics of opportunistic phytopathogensTranscriptome analysis conducted at two temperatures and at two time points after host inoculation identified a large number of differentially expressed genes. Differences in virulence at the different temperatures on grape shoots and growth on axenic cultures are shown in Fig. 3B. According to the transcriptomic data of samples collected from L. theobromae cultures on PDA plates, 361 genes were up-regulated, whereas 248 were down-regulated at the higher temperature. These up-regulated genes include genes with LysM (see Fig. 3D), allergens, GH 61 family genes, cytochrome P450s and heat shock proteins. Of these, few were related to primary pathogenicity mechanisms.Phylogenetic analysis was conducted for randomly selected genes belong to glycosyl hydrolase family (Fig. 6A). According to the analysis, all of the genes clade together with related GH family genes identified from previous studies. Figure 6B demonstrates the gene expression of these genes. To investigate the roles of these up-regulated genes in the virulence of Botryosphaeriaceae, a GH 5 family putative cellulase gene (GH 7.188) and a GH 61 family putative lignocellulase gene (GH 2.1698) were selected for further study. These two genes were overexpressed using a strong PtrpC promoter. The overexpressing transformants showed no effect on vegetative growth and conidiation on PDA medium. We confirmed the elevated expression levels of these over-expressing transformants of GH 2.1698 and GH 7.188. Intriguingly, pathogenicity assays showed that both overexpressing transformants had significantly enhanced virulence on grape shoots compared with the wild-type strain CSS-01 (Fig. 6C and D). These results suggest that lignocellulose degrading enzymes play an important role during the colonization of Botryosphaeriaceae canker development. Furthermore, our results suggest that virulence in this family is temperature dependent, a typical characteristic of opportunistic infection.

DiscussionIn this study, we developed fundamental genomic and transcriptomic resources for functional characterization of three botryosphaeriaceous pathogens, B.dothidea, L.theobromae and N.parvum. These three species have similar genome sizes (42.1 Mb to 43.3 Mb), and the assemblies of B. dothidea and N. parvum were similar to those reported in previous studies. Indeed, all the sequenced genomes in Botryosphaeriaceae have similar sizes, ranging from 36.9 to 43.5 Mb, with similar genome coverage.3,11,14 In addition to these botryosphaeriaceous taxa, the genome sizes for other pathogenic fungi compared here were similar to other common plant pathogens with similar lifestyles (Table 3).32,40,60,61 Both the JELLYFISH analysis,39 which estimated genome size based on k-mer distributions,62 and the tRNA analyses indicated a high degree of completeness in the assembled genomes. Furthermore, transcriptomic data obtained through RNASeq confirmed the accuracy and completeness of the assembled genome and facilitated the refinement of the predicted gene models of L. theobromae.63Comparison of genome sizes between L. theobromae and other pathogenic fungiComparison of genome sizes between L. theobromae and other pathogenic fungiCompared with the protein-coding genes predicted for other pathogens,3,14,40,60,61 our combined approach allowed for the prediction of the highest number of protein-coding genes in any fungal pathogen. Identifying repetitive elements is important for understanding the genome architecture of a pathogen and, ultimately, its evolution.3,4 Repetitive elements present in the genomes of Botryosphaeriaceae taxa were much lower, ranging from 3.02% to 3.84%. This ratio is much lower than those reported for other pathogens such as P. oryzae (11.75%),64,N. crassa (12.72%),60,Ustilago virens (25%)61 and V. mali (14.05%).40 This finding confirms the high genetic similarity observed among Botryosphaeriaceae species in previous studies.65Comparative genome analysis revealed data on genetic variation, differential gene expression, and evolutionary dynamics between species and their specific adaptations to different environmental conditions and lifestyles. This study revealed that Botryosphaeriaceae species are phylogenetically closer to opportunistic pathogens, indicating that they may share traits common to opportunistic fungal pathogens. This was clearly evidenced from the phylogenetic study as well as from Fig. 2B, which shows that Botryosphaeriaceae fungi share the highest number of unique orthologous gene families with opportunistic fungal pathogens (1,049) than to pathogenic (221) and non-pathogenic fungi (36). It was further confirmed by the inventory of genes identified by comparative genome analysis, which are involved in the infection and the colonization of the host by L. theobromae and other Botryosphaeriaceae pathogens. Similar results were discovered in a recent transcriptomic study conducted for L. theobromae.5 Functional annotation of these genomes provides additional evidence for the hypothesis that Botryosphaeriaceae fungi are more closely related to opportunistic fungi. According to the GO categories of the overrepresented genes, Botryosphaeriaceae species shared only three overrepresented genes with primary fungal pathogens (Supplementary Table S11), whereas they shared 27 with opportunistic phytopathogens (Supplementary Table S12). The categories of genes shared with opportunistic pathogens include those related to cell wall degradation, carbohydrate and protein metabolism, gene expression regulation and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Many of these genes have been shown to be involved in the pathogenicity of many fungal pathogens.3,5,14,40,61 Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the highest number of unique orthologous gene families shared with other opportunistic fungal pathogens, and the highest number of overrepresented gene categories shared with other opportunistic pathogens, we confirmed that Botryosphaeriaceae fungi are more closely related to opportunistic pathogens than to other pathogens. Gene categories shared between Botryosphaeriaceae species and other pathogenic fungi were also enriched in core elements essential for virulence in many pathogens. Phosphorylation is an essential post-translational modification that regulates a broad spectrum of biological processes through the activity of numerous protein kinases.66 Signal transduction is another important gene category for a pathogen to respond to environmental changes during host infection and regulate a network of cellular pathways.66. All of these virulence-related genetic elements are commonly found in the genomes of fungal pathogens such as P. oryzae, Fusarium oxysporum,66,Botrytis cinera67 and many other pathogenic fungi.68During the comparative genome analysis, we observed significant expansions and contractions in many gene families. Such changes can provide adaptive advantages for the organisms at certain ecological niches during natural selection.69 These expanded gene families include those responsible for virulence and nutrient uptake. In addition to the cellular transporters and cytochrome P450s, several gene families related to secondary metabolism have also undergone significant expansion. Among the 58 secondary metabolite clusters observed, NPRS gene clusters are responsible for the synthesis of toxic polypeptides, whereas PKS clusters are responsible for the production of naphthalenone pentaketides in botryosphaeriaceous fungi, D. seriata, L. theobromae5 and N. parvum, as well as other pathogens such as A. fumigatus, A. nidulans, D. ampelina, E. lata, Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and T.minima.9 Even though secondary metabolite gene clusters are not subjected to regulation during infection, their significant expansion in the genome suggests that they may be involved in producing disease symptoms and host adaptations. Cytochrome P450s are a super family of mono-oxygenases involved in the post-synthesis modification of diverse metabolites.3,9,46,70 Furthermore, these proteins facilitate fungal adaptation to specific ecological niches by modifying potentially harmful environmental chemicals.70 Having a genome enriched in species-specific cytochrome P450s may help explain the broad geographic distribution of botryosphaeriaceous taxa. Expansion of this gene family observed in this study further confirms their high capacity for adapting to different hosts, which may explain the wide host range of Botryosphaeriaceae species. Because these genes are also related to several physiological traits, their expansion has likely facilitated the evolution of pathogenicity.71Cellular transporters have significant roles in fungal pathogenesis as well as in protecting against plant defence compounds.72 Comparative genome analysis revealed that L. theobromae encode the highest number of cellular transporters among all the analysed genomes. Genes encoding (ABC)–type transport systems showed significant expansion in L. theobromae, and their expression is significantly up-regulated during infection. The importance of these multidrug facilitator transporters in drug resistance and pathogenesis has been confirmed in B. cinera, Gibberella pulicaris, P. oryzae, Nectria haematococca and other pathogenic fungi.15 They are also responsible for polysaccharide, lipid and amino acid transport. Similarly, the expanded and up-regulated transporter family genes identified in this study could also play an important role in the fungal pathogenesis of L. theobromae during infection by providing protection through the detoxification of antifungal phytotoxins. Sugar transporters also showed a high level of regulation during host infection in L. theobromae, allowing it to adapt to different host environments with varying pH conditions52 and various plant–pathogen interactions.52,60,73 These sugar symporters belong to the MFS family responsible for sporulation, cell-to-cell communication and pathogenesis in fungi.74 Because these families are up-regulated during infection, both ABC-type transporters and MFS transporters are considered to be virulence or pathogenicity factors in L. theobromae.Transcriptome profiling identified a set of putative effectors that were up-regulated during L. theobromae infection. These include conserved functional domains important for fungal pathogenesis mechanisms and other effector domains such as CFEM. Effectors enable pathogens to evade or suppress plant defence systems.56,75 Genetic manipulation of fungal pathogens for candidate effector genes is difficult and cumbersome. This makes the whole process of effector functional analysis time consuming and laborious. Translocation of effector proteins to host using a type III secretion system (T3SS) of bacterial pathogens proven to be a fast alternative to the traditional method of generating fungal transformants. This efficient effector delivery (pEDV) system utilizes the N-terminal portion of AvrRps4, which is required for Type III secretion system (T3SS)-dependent delivery and in planta processing. In this study, we have experimentally shown that several randomly selected putative effectors can suppress B.glumae triggered hypersensitivity in N.benthamiana. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that these putative effectors play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of L. theobromae on its hosts by identifying PAMPs. This system has been successfully used in screening candidate non-bacterial effectors predicted in the genome Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis,76,P. oryzae,77 and Ustilaginoidea virens.64In addition to the biotrophic stage, most phytopathogens also have hemi-biotrophic or necrotrophic stages, in which the fungi destroy the cell wall, enter the cell, and kill and destroy host cell structures.72 Proteins secreted by these pathogens play crucial roles in early colonization and pathogenesis by targeting all components of the primary and secondary plant cell walls.3 The current study reveals a broad range of gene families with potential virulence functions in L. theobromae, similar to the botryosphaeriaceous taxa D. seriata3, L. theobromae5 and N. parvum3. Previous studies have identified a broad range of key genes responsible for wood degradation and host colonization in phytopathogens.3,5,78,79 Similar to highly pathogenic B. cinera,80,L.theobromae possesses the highest number of genes encoding pectolytic enzymes among the sequenced Botryosphaeriaceae genomes. The significant induction of these genes during infection is consistent with their critical roles in fungal pathogenesis. Because most of the dicotyledon cell walls consist of ~35% pectin, these polygalacturonases facilitate the breakdown of cell wall.81 This localized degradation of cell wall is required for the fungus to access the plant cytoplasm and to spread across host tissues. 81,82 Their importance has been experimentally confirmed in many other species, including Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. higginsianum, C. lindemuthianum, V. mali and V. pyri.3,5,40,57,82 In addition, the L. theobromae genome encodes a wider array of enzymes (GH5, GH3, GH16, GH43) targeting cellulose and hemicellulose, similar to other pathogens such as D. seriata, E. lata, N. parvum and P. chlamydospora.3,5,78,80,82 Their expression levels were significantly induced during infection, and the current study confirmed the enhanced pathogenicity of several putative lignocellulase genes by overexpressing them in L. theobromae. Together, the up-regulation of genes encoding CAZymes targeting pectin, cellulose, hemicellulose and xylan during infection explains the rapid colonization and infection of L. theobromae on woody plants.Carbohydrate binding modules have been linked to the evolution of fungal pathogenicity in many fungi. During the infection of L. theobromae, CBM 18 family genes were significantly up-regulated. This subclass domain of chitin recognition has been confirmed for fungal protection from host defences by preventing plant factors from degrading fungal chitin.83 Hence, during fungal infection, this family together with auxiliary enzymes participates in fungal pathogenesis. In this study, the AA3 and AA7 families showed significant expansion in the L. theobromae genome. AA7-domain families are responsible for oxidizing a variety of carbohydrates and contributing to lignin degradation,59 whereas AA3-domain families participate in the degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.45 Similar expansions of AA7s and AA3s have been found in many other fungal pathogens, such as B. cinera, C. graminicola, C. higginsianum, D. seriata, E. lata, F. graminearum, F. solani, P. oryzae, N. parvum and S. hirsutum.3,59,84 In addition, this study showed the significantly induced expression of peroxidases and oxidoreductases in L. theobromae during infection. These two classes of enzymes are known to be involved in pathogenicity-related processes such as the degradation of lignin and the detoxification of reactive oxygen species produced by the host.3,5,78Our pathogenicity analysis revealed that a higher temperature increased the virulence of L. theobromae on grapevine. Consistent with this result, transcriptome analysis also revealed that several genes were up-regulated at a higher temperature. Furthermore, overexpression of two genes belonging to GH 5 and GH 61 families in L. theobromae significantly enhanced its virulence on Vitis shoots. The GH 5 and GH 61 families encode cellulases and lignocellulases, respectively. These genes are involved in cell wall degradation during infection and colonization. Transcriptome analysis revealed several genes corresponding to fungal pathogenicity, such as chitin-binding CBM family genes, cytochrome P450s and heat shock proteins, which were induced at high temperature. This increased virulence at a higher temperature is a typical characteristic of an opportunistic infection.4 Hence, we can confirm that L. theobromae can cause opportunistic infections at high temperatures. Transcriptomic study conducted on L. theobromae also confirmed the up-regulation of virulence related genes under heat stress conditions.5 Recently few studies have been conducted to determine the influence of environmental conditions such as high temperature and high humidity, on the establishment of the pathogen and the development of numerous diseases on plants.5,85In summary, this study revealed a high similarity between L. theobromae and other opportunistic fungal phytopathogens. We established genomic and transcriptomic resources for L. theobromae and incorporated the data into a comparative analysis to catalogue genes and gene families with putative virulence functions. L.theobromae employs multiple virulence strategies to adapt to its diverse lifestyles, including CWDEs, secreted proteases, secondary metabolites, putative effectors and membrane transporters. Specific gene families of pectinases, secondary metabolism enzymes and transporters related to multidrug resistance are uniquely expanded in the L. theobromae genome and are frequently up-regulated during infection. In addition, large gene inventories were involved in cell wall degradation, nutrient uptake and secondary metabolism in L. theobromae. These results suggest potential adaptations for colonization and infection of the host and reflect their hemi-biotrophic lifestyle. Functional studies, together with transcriptomic data, indicate the active role of putative effectors and some lignocellulases in virulence, pathogenicity and host adaptation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that several pathogenicity-related genes were induced at high temperature. This discovery, together with the phylogenomic analysis, indicates that L.theobromae is an opportunistic phytopathogen. This study provides valuable genomic and transcriptomic resources for future studies of the evolution and pathogenesis of L. theobromae.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.The work is supported by CARS-30, NSFC (31501567), KJCX20140402 and Beijing Nova Program (Z141105001814047).

IntroductionThe regulation of gene expression is a fundamental mechanism driving biological processes. Transcriptional regulation rules the access of polymerase complex to the gene, activating or repressing the transcription process. Transcription Factors (TF) play a central role in this context; they are proteins able to bind specific DNA regions recognizing a short sequence of nucleotides called Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS). There is a vast literature concerning TFs, starting from seminal and general papers1,2 to the most specific ranging from the study of the mechanism that allows TFs to efficiently and rapidly find the target along the DNA helix,3,4 to the study of the roles that specific TFs play in given biological tasks and how they influence the regulation of the transcription of their target genes.5 TFBS occurrences along a DNA sequence can be statistically determined via a Position-specific Weight Matrix (PWM), that is essentially a matrix reporting the frequency of nucleotides for each position of the experimentally found binding sites. Several databases based on experimental evidences were designed collecting information about TFs and the corresponding TFBSs, TRANSFAC6,7 and JASPAR8 are often used as a reference for Eukariotes. In the review9 different algorithmic approaches to predict TFBSs, starting from PWMs, are presented and compared. Despite the large number of genes in higher animals (~30,000 genes) the number of known TFs is one order of magnitude smaller, indicating a necessary interplay between different TFs in order to regulate the activity of all genes. TFBSs are often clustered in peculiar families and patterns made of several TFBSs can be found in the promoter region, i.e. thousands bases upstream the Transcription Starting Site (TSS), or also very far from the TSS in the Cis-regulatory modules (CRM). The interested reader can find in Ref. 10 (see also references therein) a comprehensive review of the update knowledge about CRM. In this work, we will focus on the synergism of different TFs in the promoter region, trying to identify those TFs couples able to co-operate, and to discover the context in which those couples are involved in. The synergism between TFs in human DNA has been investigated by several studies focused on the analysis of mutual positioning of TFBSs along the DNA regions. Some studies, taking into consideration cross-species sequence comparison trying to identify possible regulatory modules in human DNA.11–13 Other works focus on a specific class of TFs14 or on a single TF15 trying to identify the regulatory modules to which the considered TF belongs to. Finally in Ref. 16, the whole human genome has been investigated in order to reveal the couples of TFs that synergically act in the transcription regulation. In the present work, we developed a new computational method able to predict the possible interaction between couples of TFs analysing the statistical properties of the distribution of couples of TFBSs in the promoter region of human DNA, and comparing them with a random distribution of TFBSs. We obtained a list of highly related TFs couples, whose TFBSs occurrences significantly group together for a given set of promoter genes, identifying the biological context in which the couples are involved in and the process they should contribute to regulate. 2. Materials and methods2.1. Extracting TFBSs of human genesThe list of all human genes was extracted from the Genome Browser (UCSC)17 and all the associated 104,178 transcript sequences (genome version hg38) were retrieved by a proper R library18 querying the UCSC data repository. For each transcript a promoter region, made of a sequence of 2,000 bp upstream the TSS, was extracted. In order to remove redundant information, the set of all promoter sequences was processed filtering out redundant overlapped transcripts, reducing their number (and the related promoter sequences) to 36,830. In this study, we used a set of 194 most studied and experimentally validated Human Transcription Factors according to MAPPER.19 We associated to each TF the corresponding Position-specific Weight Matrix (PWM), i.e. the matrix reporting the frequency of nucleotides for each position of the experimentally validated binding sites. It is worth noting that a TF can be associated to different PWMs and, on the other hand, a PWM can be associated to more than one TF. A total number of 192 PWMs was considered in this work and each of them was associated in a biunivocal relation to one TF with only a few exceptions. For the sake of simplicity and readability, we refer to PWM models as TFs and vice versa. The PWMs matrices were retrieved from an open access repository available at the following address http://cistrome.org/~jian/motif_collection/databases/Transfac/pwm/ (12 October 2017, date last accessed). We applied the matchPWM() function, a sequence-based transcription factor binding site search algorithm, integrated into the Biostrings R library,20 to extract and collect the positions list of all binding sites for both all considered transcripts and PWMs. For our purposes, we have considered an acceptance threshold probability of 0.9. The described procedure is clearly summarized in the workflow in Fig. 1. Workflow for the extraction of human TFBSs.Workflow for the extraction of human TFBSs.2.2. Transcription factor co-localization and deviation from randomnessThe above z-score function, measuring how many standard deviations the actual number of couples is far from the expected number of couples in the case of a random distribution, provides a reasonable value of the association between TFBSi and TFBSj. Significantly, high values of zTFi,TFj suggest that the two considered TFs are associated, i.e. their TFBSs have a probability to occur as neighbours higher than the one expected for a random distribution. On the contrary when zTFi,TFj is negative, with a high absolute value, elements in the two TFBSs occur as neighbours less frequently than expected in a random distribution, so that in this case the TFs are disassociated. In the following, in order to identify the synergy between transcription factors, we will focus on the case of high positive values of zTFi,TFj<U+2060>.2.3. Computing similarity score of PWMsThe prediction algorithm of TFBSs is based on the PWMs obtained by experimental analysis. Since we are interested in identifying couples of TFs whose TFBSs occur together in a window of a given size, we have to be sure that the two corresponding models are enough different since if two models are very similar they are likely to share binding sites or a significant portion of them. We used two different approaches to evaluate models similarity. The former is a direct approach aiming to provide a similarity pairwise score of two models based on the comparison of nucleotide frequencies of the PWMs. The latter approach can be defined as ‘a posteriori’, since we evaluate the closeness of models by computing the number of overlapped binding sites with respect to the total number of couples whose distance is closer than l<U+2060>. Using a linear combination of the above described similarity scores we determine if two models are ‘structurally’ far from each other and we can significantly evaluate the association between two truly different models according to the algorithm described in the previous section.2.4.

The plane is divided into two regions: the upper-left sector, where Overlapping Score is higher than Similarity Score, provides selected couples. Lower-right sector, where Overlapping Score is lower than Similarity Score, provides Discarded couples.2.6. Protein-protein interaction network analysisIn order to validate the synergy of TFs couples identified by the algorithm here presented we analysed Protein-Protein Interaction network (PPI) to test the interaction of this couples in the network by using shortest path.Protein-Protein Interaction network was downloaded from STRING database.22 We considered all the possible interaction sources between proteins giving a score threshold of 0.7 (high confidence interaction). The obtained network is made of 719,288 edges (interactions) and 14,932 nodes (proteins). The iGraph R package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph/index.html (12 October 2017, date last accessed)) was used to compute the shortest path from the adjacency matrix of the graph.3. Results and discussion3.1. Selecting significant TF couplesIn the previous Section, Equation (6) has been derived in order to provide a measure of association between each couple of transcription factors (TFi, TFj) with respect to a given transcript TRk. Our goal is to find out couples of TFs that are significantly related in gene-regulation mechanism. As previously mentioned, the higher the value of z(TFi,TFj;TRk)<U+2060>, the higher the association between TFi and TFj in the transcript promoter TRk sequence will be. Since for each transcript, we have to test a considerably large number of couples (TFi, TFj) and we test the association between couples in a large number of transcripts, we select only those couples for which the value of z(TFi,TFj;TRk) is higher than 5 (meaning that the number of occurrence of couples TFi TFj in a radius l is far from that expected by chance more than 5 S.D.) and we indicate with NZ5(TFi,TFj) the number of transcripts TRk for which the couple (TFi, TFj) has a z-score greater than 5. Given a couple (TFi, TFj) it is reasonable to expect that a large value of NZ5(TFi,TFj) indicates that the two models TFi, TFj are functionally associated. However, a high value of NZ5(TFi,TFj) could refer to a couple of models with a high similarity score rather than a functional association between TFi and TFj. Therefore, to correctly identify relevant associated transcription factors, we will use the overlapping score OVD(TFi, TFj) and the similarity score JSD(TFi, TFj). In Fig. 3, OVD(TFi, TFj) and JSD(TFi, TFj) values are shown for all the TF couples which have NZ5TFi,TFj>20<U+2060>. Since the higher the value of JSD the lower the similarity between two models is, while the higher the values of OVD the higher the similarity between binding sites is, as selection criterion to identify significant couples we used the inequality JSD > OVD. In such a way, the plane (OVD, JSD) is divided into two regions: the upper-left sector, where models are not similar and the overlapping is low (selected couples), while in the lower-right sector, where models are similar and the overlapping is high (discarded couples). It is worth remarking that even if measures JSD and OVD could appear redundant, Fig. 3 clearly stated that the two measures are quite different: there are couples with similar JSD and very different OVD and vice versa. In fact JSD measure only depends on the related PWM while OVD measure depends on the considered dataset, e.g. two models can bind the same sequence even if they are different. Considering a combination of both measures we obtain a more robust selection criterion.In Fig. 4 (panel A) is sketched the procedure we use to select the 547 couples identifying pairs of transcription factors that are likely to synergistically regulate gene transcription. In the following sections, we will analyse the set of selected couples in order to associate to them a biological task and to find the most relevant associated couples according to their statistical features (see Fig. 4 panel B). Workflow for the analysis of TF couples. In panel A, the procedure for the selection of relevant couples is depicted. In panel B, the analysis of significant couples is described both in terms of enrichment tests and sorting of best couples.Workflow for the analysis of TF couples. In panel A, the procedure for the selection of relevant couples is depicted. In panel B, the analysis of significant couples is described both in terms of enrichment tests and sorting of best couples.3.2. Enrichment analysis and validationIn order to evaluate the biological significance of the obtained TF couples, we performed hypergeometric enrichment tests.23 Given a couple of models, we want to test whether the set of genes potentially regulated by the synergy of the corresponding two TFs, is enriched in a particular category-term. We wondered whether those genes are linked in a given biological task in order to associate the TF couple to a given biological process. We selected a list of categories and related terms, reported in Table 1, that identify different biological tasks and contexts. We then performed for each identified TF couple hypergeometric enrichment tests related to all the considered terms. Categories and terms for the enrichment analysisCategories and terms for the enrichment analysisFor each TF couple we obtained a list of P-values linked to the corresponding terms. The enrichment results were then compared with those of ten random sets of genes. Each set was generated preserving the same number of sample couples (i.e. 547) and the same number of genes for each couple. The results are reported in Fig. 5 where solid plot represents the enrichment of couples identified by our algorithm and dashed plots show enrichment of random sets. Each point of the plots shows in log-scale the number of TF couples (y-axis) with at least one term whose P-value falls in the corresponding P-value interval (x-axis). For example in the black plot, there is only one couple (M00106—M00967) having a term [ubiquitinyl hydrolase activity (GO: 0036459)] enriched with a P-value smaller than 10-18 (3.63E–19), another couple (M00739—M00799) for P-value smaller than 10-14 and three different couples for P-value smaller than 10-13 and so on (see Table 2 where all the enriched terms are ordered according to their P-values). It is worth noting that some couples have more than one term with a significant P-value, for example couple (M00106—M00967) shows several terms with a remarkable enrichment: GO Molecular function—ubiquitinyl hydrolase activity (GO: 0036459)—P-value 3.63E–19, Go Molecular function—cysteine-type peptidase activity (GO: 0008234)—P-value 4.56E–17, Go Biological Process—Ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (GO: 0006511), and so on. The comparison of enrichment P-values, related to couples identified by our algorithm (black plot), with those related to random sets (ten coloured plots) clearly highlights the significance and consistency of our analysis, since none of the random sets shows P-values smaller than 10-7. Also analysing the plots for larger P-values intervals the number of enriched couples is significantly higher than all the corresponding numbers of random sets (taking into account the log-scale units in y-axis). The PWM model IDs and the corresponding TF names are reported in columns 1–4 for each couple; the category and the related term the couple resulted enriched in are reported in columns 5–6; column 7 reports the related P-value of the hypergeometric testThe PWM model IDs and the corresponding TF names are reported in columns 1–4 for each couple; the category and the related term the couple resulted enriched in are reported in columns 5–6; column 7 reports the related P-value of the hypergeometric testNumber of couples enriched in at least one term as a function of their smallest P-value.

Solid plot shows the enrichment of the couples identified by our algorithm, dashed plots show the enrichment of random couples for comparison.3.3. Analysis of relevant transcription factor couplesIn this section, we analyse the most significant couples identified by our algorithm. Among the 547 selected couples, we consider as particularly relevant those couples with the smallest enrichment P-value or with the best associated parameters (highest number of transcripts, smallest OVD and highest JSD) as reported in Fig. 4 panel B. The list of couples with the smallest P-values (smaller than 10-7) is reported in Table 2. The analysis of the couples reported in the table suggests several observations, providing and/or confirming evidence of the synergism of several TF couples and the related biological contexts they are involved in. The smallest P-values are reported for the couple CDP (also known as Cutl1) (M00106)–HNF4 (M00967), as already mentioned above. The related enriched terms are mainly associated (4 out of 6) with catabolic processes while the other two terms are ubiquitinyl hydrolase activity and cysteine-type peptidase activity. Concerning the couple Myc (M00799)–E2F (M00803) (and its cluster E2F–1 and E2F–4) it can be observed that it appears several times in the table associated to different terms. These terms can be grouped into main activities/contexts regarding: (1) gonadal mesoderm development and mesenchyme development, (2) Nucleosome assembly and organization, Protein-DNA complex assembly and Protein-DNA Complex Subunit Organization and (3) Protein Autophosphorylation. It is worth noting that in literature there are many references associated to the couple Myc–E2F. In Ref. 24, it has been shown how the two TFs are linked via mSin3A, a core component of a large multiprotein co-repressor complex with associated histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymatic activity. As reported in Ref. 25, it has been identified a subunit of the complex NuA4 as the product of TRA1, an ATM-related gene homologous to human TRRAP, an essential cofactor for c-Myc- and E2F-mediated oncogenic transformation. A further link between Myc and E2F was studied in Ref. 26 highlighting their relationships with chromatin structure and stability. It is remarkable and can be source of further investigations the association of the couple AREB (M00415)–TFII-I (M00706) (also known as GTF2I) with KEGG pathway Valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis (the couple showing a P-value of 4.10E–8). Interestingly, transcription factors of STAT family (STAT—M00777, STATx—M00223 and STAT5A–M00457) strongly interact with TBP (M00980) in the promoters of genes belonging to the region of chr5q13, that is known to be associated with various neurological disorders and pathologies such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Hairy Cell Leukemia and it is also connected to Alcohol Dependence.27–29 Finally, it could deserve attention the couple Areb6 (M00414)–E2F (M00803) associated to the term Mental retardation, even if not reported in Table 2, it shows a remarkable P-value (6·10-6). Areb6 belongs to the Zeb transcription factor family that has been shown to be involved in mental retardation syndromes.30 In Table 3, the best couples, in terms of association, are reported ordered by the number of significant Transcripts. We selected those couples with a number of significant transcripts (Z-score higher than 5) higher than 100, with an Overlapping score (OVD) smaller than 0.2 and a Similarity score (JSD) higher than 0.2 (it is also reported in the fifth column the average Z-Score). The couple MZF1 (M00083)—MAZ (M00649) shows a Z-score higher than 5 in 1,014 transcript promoter sequences (with an average z-score of 7.77—more than 7 S.D. far from the expected average value). Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) and Myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) are both transcription factors characterized by a zinc finger small protein structural motif. The associated PWMs show a similar common sub-motif characterized by a GGGA sequence. Nevertheless the PWMs have different length (6 and 8) and the correspondent similarity score, JSD, results to be 0.21 meaning that the two PWMs are similar but globally not so close to each other. Significantly, the OVD overlapping score is quite low 0.188 meaning that, on average, among all the identified TFBSs couple (both in a window of 80 bp) of the two TFs, less than 1 out of 5 couples are overlapped. This is why we included this couple in the selected set of TFs couples. The surprisingly high number of transcripts for which the two TFs co-occur should deserve deeper investigations. The couple MZF1 (M00083)–E2F (M00803) shows 456 transcripts with a Z-score higher than 5 (with an average z-score of 6, 77, OVD = 0.09 and JSD = 0.21). Interestingly they are involved in several diseases, in particular, as reported in Ref. 31, they are both potential key regulators of PKD1 and PKD2 whose mutations are linked with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). We found one transcript of PKD1 uc002cos.1 with a Z-score for the couple equal to 2 and two transcripts of PKD2 uc003hre.3 and uc011cdg.2 with Z-score equal to 5.80 and 3.42, respectively. It is interesting that a minor groove binding protein SRY (M00148) is associated to both the models of TBP (M00471 and M00980) with a number of significant transcripts equal to 239 and 203, respectively, a very small OVD close to 0 for both and JSD 0.21 and 0.23, respectively. It is worth noting that the couple Myc (M00799)–E2F (M00803) (also included in Table 2) shows a number of significant transcripts equal to 293, meaning that, besides a clear association with given biological contexts, as discussed in the previous section, there is a strong synergism between the two TFs confirmed by the values reported in the table. Concerning the couple Maz (M00649)–Pu.1 (M00658) (number of significant transcripts equal to 187) it has been shown that three transcription factors Maz, PU.1 and ARNT show significant recognition elements among similarly up or down-regulated genes involved in hematopoietic differentiation or leukemogenesis.32 We note that also the couple Maz (M00649)–ARNT (M00976) is included in the table with a number of significant transcripts equal to 106. The PWM model IDs and the corresponding TF names are reported in columns 1–4 for each couple; Column 5 reports the number of transcripts whose Z-scores, related to the couple, are higher than 5; the average Z-score of all the significant (Z > 5) transcripts is reported in column 6; Overlapping and Similarity Scores are reported in columns 7 and 8, respectivelyThe couple Myc, E2F is reported in bold to highlight it is also included in Table 2.The PWM model IDs and the corresponding TF names are reported in columns 1–4 for each couple; Column 5 reports the number of transcripts whose Z-scores, related to the couple, are higher than 5; the average Z-score of all the significant (Z > 5) transcripts is reported in column 6; Overlapping and Similarity Scores are reported in columns 7 and 8, respectivelyThe couple Myc, E2F is reported in bold to highlight it is also included in Table 2.Frequencies of couples as a function of the shortest path (SP) distance for three classes of protein couples: (i) the selected 547 TF couples (namely BEST, first row), (ii) all the couples of TFs (namely ALL, second row) and iii) 10 random sample sets made of 547 randomly picked protein couples from the whole PPI (namely RANDOM, mean and standard deviation in the third and fourth row, respectively)Frequencies of couples as a function of the shortest path (SP) distance for three classes of protein couples: (i) the selected 547 TF couples (namely BEST, first row), (ii) all the couples of TFs (namely ALL, second row) and iii) 10 random sample sets made of 547 randomly picked protein couples from the whole PPI (namely RANDOM, mean and standard deviation in the third and fourth row, respectively)In order to further validate and provide significance to obtained results, we computed the shortest paths between couples of TFs related to the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network downloaded from String database.22 We found a significant overall difference between shortest path distribution of the set of couples selected by our method and the set of all TFs couples. In Table 4, we report the percentages of couples as a function of the Shortest Path (SP) distances for three classes of protein couples: (i) the selected 547 TF couples (namely BEST, first row), (ii) all the couples of TFs (namely ALL, second row) and (iii) 10 random sample sets made of 547 randomly picked protein couples from the whole PPI (namely RANDOM, mean and standard deviation in the third and fourth row, respectively). The majority of couples (around 50%) related to TFs shows a SP equal to 2 both for couples obtained by our algorithm and for all TF couples, while only around 6% of protein random couples has a SP distance equal to 2. The most relevant result is in the difference of the frequency for SP = 1 (indicating a direct interaction) that is ~0.12 for our best couples and ~0.057 for all TF couples (i.e. the ratio is greater than 2), and also for SP = 3 (~0.28 our best couples versus ~0.37 for all TF couples). The distribution for the random protein data shows, not surprisingly, a complete different pattern (the most part of couples having SP equal to 3 and 4). Even considering the limitations of this kind of analysis—a PPI is a global representation of potential interactions between proteins (and consequently TFs) that not always (referring to time and space) is an actual interaction and, moreover, the results depend on the threshold chosen to select significant interactions—it reveals that TFs couples selected by our method show an overall stronger relationship than those in the set of all TFs couples. In particular, we chose a quite strict threshold of 0.7 (as reported in the Material and methods section), so the significance of results has to be found in the ratio between the number of our selected couples and all TFs couples at SP 1 (ratio equal to 2) rather than in the percentages (12% and 6%, approximately) that could significantly change since they depend on the threshold. 4. ConclusionsA better understanding of the mechanisms driving the regulation of protein expression is an essential requisite to shed light on the behaviour of cells. Transcription factors play a central role in this extremely complex task and it has been shown that they synergically co-operate in order to provide a fine tuning of protein expressions. Among the different methods able to detect and identify TFs interplay, a very important resource is the computational methods to which our work mainly refers. In this work, we present a mathematically well-founded procedure able to identify TFs couples that act together, inferring for several of those couples the biological context they are involved in. We introduced a new and robust statistical method based on the use of a good Bernoulli approximation and on a z-score measures able to discriminate between random and non-random co-occurrences of couple of TFs. We extended previous methods based on randomize sequences as in Refs. 15 and 16. In order to avoid biases due to the structural similarity of different models Overlapping and Similarity scores were designed to select TF couples that are significant for the analysis. We used such a method to find pairs of associated transcription factors in the set of all human promoter sequences (selected with a careful analysis from all human transcripts) and we also performed enrichment analysis on the set of genes regulated by identified couples. This analysis provides consistence to our results but also provides a biological context to be associated to the couples. Moreover, we also performed network analysis showing that TFs couples identified by the algorithm here presented are closer than expected in the protein-protein interaction network in terms of shortest path.To our knowledge this is the only work concerning synergy of Transcription Factors taking into account all those features. Some of the couples emerging in this study are already known to be linked in several biological contexts (such as Myc–E2F,24–26 while in other cases our results can lead to hypothesize links between TFs couples and diseases (as for the STAT family that strongly interact with TBM in the promoters of genes belonging to the region of chr5q13 involved in several diseases.27–29 Finally, some other couples were not previously identified (such as the couple MZF1–MAZ) that would deserves further investigation.According to our algorithm two TFs could be associated in different ways, for example they could be co-operative in a strict sense or concurrent in the sense that the presence of one of the two impedes the presence of the other. A small size window, as the one we use, leads us to hypothesize that two transcription factor proteins that could bind sites within the window, either are sufficiently close to each other to physically interact, or only one of the two is able to bind its TFBS because of the steric hindrance.This work represents a step in the direction of designing complex gene regulatory networks, and it provides information on TFs association that could be useful in this context. The identification of significant TFs couples could be of help in the view of artificially altering the regulation of genes by inhibiting the interaction between given TFs couples.Conflict of interestNone declared."

IntroductionCultivated roses (Rosa × hybrida) are by far the most beloved flowers and the most important floricultural crop. The genus Rosa contains 120–200 species distributed in the Northern hemisphere. R. hybrida constitutes approximately eight Rosa species (R. multiflora, R. luciae, R. moschata, R. damascene, R. gallica, R. chinensis, R. gigantea, and R. foetida)1–3 by repeated natural and artificial hybridizations. R. hybrida is a tetraploid (2n = 4x = 28), and the ancestral roses are diploid (2n = 2x = 14). As a consequence of natural and artificial hybridization, cultivated roses have various floral characteristics, including intense red, orange, and yellow colors, ever-flowering and larger inflorescences with a large number of petals. Roses have been partly characterized focusing on ornamentally important characters such as flower color, scent, flowering, floral morphogenesis, and development. Roses generally share common mechanisms of these characters with other flowering plants. Roses also contain unique enzymes such as anthocyanin 5, 3-glucosyltransferase,4 nucleoside diphosphate linked some moiety X hydrolase 1 (Nudix 1) leading to monoterpenes,5 and phenylpyruvate decarboxylase (RyPPDC) leading to 2-phenylethanol (2PE).6The Rosaceae family contains many important fruit plants and some genome structures have been studied, such as apple (Malus × domestica),7 woodland strawberry (Fragaria vesca),8 Japanese apricot (Prunus mume),9 peach (Prunus persica),10 pear (Pyrus bretschneideri),11 and European pear (Pyrus communis).12 Recently, the Rosa roxburghii genome, a Chinese medicinal rose, was surveyed.13 The Rose Genome Sequence Initiative is presently obtaining a high-quality genome sequence of R. chinensis cultivar Old Blush and provides RNA-Seq data.14 The scaffold sequences of Rosa × damascena (accession number PRJNA322107) and Illumina raw reads from R. dumalis, R. inodora, and R. canina (PRJEB15546) are available from the NCBI SRA database. Currently, the whole genome sequence of an ancestral species of R. hybrida has not been revealed. R. multiflora belonging to the section Synstylae is native to eastern Asia, including Japan. It is a thorny perennial shrub and exhibits clusters of white or pale fragrant flowers of five petals. R. multiflora, derived from Japan, was utilized to breed modern cultivated roses15 to confer clustering fluorescence to R. hybrida. Its resistance locus (Rdr1) to black spot caused by Diplocarpon rosae Wolf has been introgressed into R. hybrida.16 A genomic region of 265,477 bp containing Rdr1 with a cluster of nine highly related TIR-NBS-LRR candidate genes has been reported.16 The nuclear (2 C) DNA amounts of R. multiflora has been estimated to be 1.65 pg,17 indicating its haploid genome size is approximately 750 Mb.To deepen fundamental understanding of R. multiflora and related species, structural analysis of the whole genome of R. multiflora was performed. This genomic study will also be a valuable resource for rose breeding, in combination with the genetic map18 and pave the way to clarify complex pedigree of the cultivated roses in terms of genome level.2. Materials and methods2.1. MaterialsR. multiflora studied here was obtained from Keisei Rose Nurseries (Chiba, Japan) (Fig. 1). This plant cultivar originated from Sawara, Chiba prefecture, Japan. The flavonoids of the petals were analysed previously as described.19 Genomic DNA was prepared from the young leaves using DNeasy Plant Maxi Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, USA). Total RNA was prepared from the petal of bud, young leaf, and young root of R. multiflora (Fig. 1B, C, and D) and from the young petal and young leaf of the R. hybrida cultivar ‘Rote Rose’ using RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, USA). R. multiflora used in this study (A). Total RNA was prepared from the petals of buds (B), leaves (C) and roots (D) for RNA-Seq analysis. R. multiflora used in this study (A). Total RNA was prepared from the petals of buds (B), leaves (C) and roots (D) for RNA-Seq analysis. 2.2. Shotgun sequencingShotgun sequencing was carried out using HiSeq 2000 and MiSeq platforms (Illumina Inc., CA, USA). The paired-end (PE) library with insert size of approximately 500 bp was prepared by TruSeq Nano DNA LT Sample Prep Kit. Mate-pair (MP) libraries with insert sizes 2, 5, 10, and 20 kb were constructed by Nextera Mate Pair Sample Prep Kit and GS FLX Titanium Paired End Adaptor Set. These samples were run on HiSeq 2000 and MiSeq with 101 and 301 cycles sequencing kits, respectively. Sequencing of transcripts (RNA-Seq) was also performed for R. multiflora and R. hybrida cultivar ‘Rote Rose’, the most common rose cultivar in Japan. The PE libraries of RNA-Seq sampled from bud, leaf, and root were sequenced by MiSeq sequencer.The read quality was checked by FastQC 0.11.2.20 Nucleotides with quality value <10 and adaptor sequences at 3' termini of reads were trimmed by PRINSEQ 0.20.421 and FASTX-toolkit 0.0.14 (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit), respectively. After trimming, PE and MP reads with >100 bases and PE reads with size of 250–300 bases were selected for sequencing by HiSeq 2000 and MiSeq, respectively. Reads shorter than 99 bases and including unknown nucleotides were excluded.The genome size of R. multiflora was estimated using HiSeq 2000 and MiSeq PE reads with k-mer size = 17. The k-mer distribution was investigated using Jellyfish 2.1.3.22 Genome size was estimated using the peak in the k-mer frequency distribution curve according to the method used in a previous study.232.3. Assembly, expression level analysis, and SNP detectionThe trimmed PE and MP reads were used for genome assembly by SOAPdenovo rev240 (-M 1)24 with k-mer sizes, 71, 81, and 91. After assembly, gaps on scaffolds were closed by GapCloser 1.10 (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapdenovo.html) (p = 31). The scaffolds were subjected to BLASTN searches with E-value cutoff of 1E-10 and length coverage =10% against bacteria, fungi, and human genome sequences (hg19) from NCBI, vector sequences from UniVec (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/univec/), genome sequences of chloroplast of Fragaria vesca (NC_015206.1) and mitochondria of Arabidopsis thaliana (NC_001284.2), and PhiX sequence used in Illumina sequencing. Scaffolds exhibiting homology to these were excluded as contamination.RNA-Seq reads sampled from bud, leaf, and root of R. multiflora were assembled by Trinity r20140717.25 At same gene locus, several contigs derived from splicing variants were predicted; therefore, the contig with the highest IsoPct value calculated by RSEM 1.2.1526 was selected as the transcript. The contigs thus obtained were mapped onto the scaffolds by BLAT v3427 with =90% similarity and score =200 (–maxIntron = 10,000). According to the mapping results, scaffolds were connected by L_RNA_scaffolder.28 As a result, scaffolds longer than 300 bases were selected and designated RMU_r2.0. Repetitive sequences were detected by RepeatScout 1.0.529 and RepeatMasker 4.0.3 (http://www.repeatmasker.org) according to the method used in a previous study.23Expression levels of the genes in bud, leaf, and root were investigated for R. multiflora. The RNA-Seq reads were mapped onto the scaffolds of RMU_r2.0 by TopHat v2.0.14.30 The FPKM (fragments per kilobase of exon per million fragments mapped reads) value of the genes were calculated by Cufflinks v2.2.1.31 RNA-Seq reads of R. hybrida cultivar ‘Rote Rose’ were used for detection of SNPs distinguishing R. multiflora. The RNA-Seq reads were mapped onto the scaffolds of RMU_r2.0 by TopHat v2.0.14.30 The BAM files obtained were used for SNP detection by SAMtools v0.1.19.322.4. AuthenticityThe full BAC sequence of the black spot resistance muRdr1 gene locus of R. multiflora line 88/124-4616 was obtained from NCBI nuccore database (HQ455834.1; 265,477 bp). The nine TIR-NBS-LRR resistance proteins, muRdr1A-muRdr1I, were encoded in the BAC sequence. The genes were mapped onto the scaffolds of RMU_r2.0 by BLAT with =95% similarity and score =200 (–minIdentity = 95). To compare the genic regions among the related species, the EST sequences of R. hybrida (12,649 sequences; Supplementary Table S1), R. luciae (1,936 sequences; Supplementary Table S1), and R. virginiana (5,978 sequences; Supplementary Table S1) obtained from NCBI’s dbEST were mapped onto the genome sequence of RMU_r2.0 by BLAT with =95% similarity and score =100. Conservation of the core eukaryotic genes and single-copy orthologous genes were investigated using CEGMA v2.533 and BUSCO ver. 1.1b,34 respectively. In CEGMA, genome completeness was estimated by using 248 CEGs (Core Eukaryotic Genes) to classify them into complete and partial genes. In BUSCO, genome completeness was estimated by using single-copy orthologous genes selected from OrthoDB to classify them into complete genes (single-copy and duplicated), fragmented genes, and missing genes.2.5. Gene assignment and annotationThe RNA-Seq reads were mapped onto the scaffolds of RMU_r2.0 with TopHat 2.0.1430 to generate a BAM file. This file was used for making a training set by BRAKER1 v1.3.35 GeneMark-ET 4.21,36 and Augustus 3.0.337 were initially applied to build the training set, and Augustus 3.0.3 was applied to predict genes using the training set. The predicted genes were subjected to homology searches against NCBI NR database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/db/FASTA/nr.gz) and translated genes of A. thaliana in TAIR10 (https://www.arabidopsis.org) using BLASTP with an E-value cutoff of 1E-10. Domain searches against InterPro (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) were conducted using InterProScan38 with an E-value cutoff of 1.0. Genes related to transposable elements (TEs) were inferred according to the results of BLAST searches against the NCBI NR database, and domain searches against InterPro and GyDB 2.039 using hmmsearch in HMMER 3.040 with an E-value cutoff of 1.0. Transfer RNA genes (tRNAs) were predicted by tRNAscan-SE 1.23.41 Ribosomal RNA genes (rRNAs) were predicted by HMMER 3.0 searches against the Rfam 11.0 database.The predicted peptide sequences of R. multiflora were searched to assign enzymes/proteins to various biosynthetic pathways by BLASTP using counterpart protein sequences as queries, and one or a few best-matched sequences with low E-values were selected. In the case of phylogenetic analysis of MADS-box genes, expansins, xyloglucan endotransglycosylase/hydrolases (XTHs) or aquaporins, we used BLASTP and keyword search (the word ‘MADS’, ‘expansin’, ‘xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase’, or ‘aquaporin’ was used) in the Rosa multiflora Genome DataBase (http://rosa.kazusa.or.jp). For BLASTP search, we used amino acid sequences of each genes characterized in model plants as queries with E-value cutoff of 1E-20. Multiple sequence alignments were constructed by DDBJ CLUSTALW version 2.1 (http://clustalw.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/) with default parameters. Phylogenetic trees were generated using the neighbor-joining method included in the DDBJ CLUSTALW version 2.1 with default parameters and circular cladograms were constructed using Dendroscope 3.422.6. Functional analyses of the predicted genesThe predicted genes were classified into the functional categories defined in NCBI’s ‘euKaryotic clusters of Orthologous Groups (KOG)’43 by BLASTP searches with an E-value cutoff of 1E-4. The genes were mapped onto the KEGG reference pathways by BLAST searches against the KEGG GENES database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/genes.html) and UniProt (TrEMBL + Swiss-Prot) database (http://www.uniprot.org) with an E-value cutoff of 1E-80, length coverage of 25%, and identity of 50%. The genes were also mapped onto the KEGG reference pathways of F. vesca (v2.0a1), P. persica (peach; v2.0a1), and Malus × domestica (apple; v1.0p). The genes of the four plant species were compared by OrthoMCL v2.0.9.44 The genome sequence, CDS and pep sequences, and annotation of F. vesca (v2.0a1), peach (v2.0a1), and apple (v1.0p) were obtained from the Genome Database for Rosaceae (GDR; https://www.rosaceae.org). The Gene Ontology (GO) categories were assigned to the genes based on the raw files obtained by InterProScan. The distribution of the genes in GO categories was investigated according to GOslim (http://www.geneontology.org/page/go-slim-and-subset-guide).3. Results and discussion3.1. Sequencing of the rose genomeThe 1.1 G PE reads were obtained by HiSeq 2000 with length 100 bp and 178 M PE reads for MiSeq with length 301 bp. The MP reads of insert sizes, 2, 5, 10, and 20 kb, were obtained by HiSeq 2000 for 501, 610, 425, and 394 M reads with length 101 bp. The obtained reads are summarized in Supplementary Table S2. The quality of reads was checked using FastQC, and quality trimming and adaptor trimming were performed by PRINSEQ and FastX-toolkit, respectively. The one nucleotide on 3' termini was trimmed because of low quality. Finally, reads with lengths 100 and 250–300 bp were selected for HiSeq 2000 and MiSeq reads, respectively, and divided into paired and single reads. After quality control, 95.3% of MiSeq PE reads and 88.7% of HiSeq 2000 PE reads were used for assembly. For MP reads with insert sizes, 2, 5, 10, and 20 kb obtained by HiSeq 2000, 26.3%, 4.4%, 9.3%, and 4.9% were used for assembly, respectively.The k-mer frequency distribution curve (k-mer =17) derived from PE reads is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. As a result, the genome size was estimated at 1,087,968,027 and 711,129,940 bases using the two peaks at multiplicity = 117 (coverage = 133.7) and 179 (coverage = 204.5), respectively. According to the peak (multiplicity = 179), the haploid genome size was estimated to 711 Mb, which was close to the estimated size,17,23 and thus the peak at multiplicity = 117 may reflect the presence of heterozygosity in R. multiflora. The numbers of raw and trimmed reads are summarized in Supplementary Table S2. The trimmed reads were applied to the assembly using SOAPdenovo2 with k-mer sizes = 71, 81, and 91. From the results of the assemblies, the N50 lengths using k-mer sizes 71, 81, and 91 were 30,732, 35,285, and 28,059 bases, respectively. Judging from the N50 lengths, the scaffolds assembled with k-mer size = 81 were used for further analysis (Supplementary Table S3). The gaps on the scaffolds were closed by GapCloser 1.10. The RNA-Seq from bud, leaf, and root was assembled by Trinity, and splicing variants were excluded by RSEM (Supplementary Table S4). The contigs were used for scaffolding using L_RNA_scaffolder. As a result, 158,733 scaffolds with total length 767,886,425 and N50 length 86,097 bp were obtained (Supplementary Table S3). Finally, 75,439 scaffolds shorter than 500 bp and 105 scaffolds with probable contamination hit against chloroplast, mitochondrial, fungal and bacterial genomes were excluded, and the resultant 83,189 scaffolds were determined as representing the draft genome sequence, RMU_r2.0 (Table 1). The total length of RMU_r2.0 was 739,637,845 bp, and N50 length was 90,830 bp. The scaffolds were prefixed with ‘Rmu’ followed by a seven-digit identifier and sequence version (e.g. Rmu_ssc0000001.1). Considering the genome size estimated by distribution of k-mer frequency, the total length of the assembled genome sequence was somewhat longer, probably due to heterozygosity. Genomic feature of RMU_r2.0 and RMU_r2.0_cdsGenomic feature of RMU_r2.0 and RMU_r2.0_cdsAuthenticity of the assembled genome sequence was performed by similarity searches for the full BAC sequence of R. multiflora and for EST sequences of R. hybrida, R. lucieae, and R. virginiana. In the BAC sequence, only nine TIR-NBS-LRR resistance genes were annotated. Therefore, gene prediction was conducted to the BAC sequence by the same method applied to the scaffolds. As a result, 53 genes were predicted from the BAC sequence, and 10 genes of them were homologous to TIR-NBS-LRR resistance genes. Synteny between Rmu_sc0000110.1 and the BAC sequence was investigated using nucmer,45 as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. There are two regions without similarity between them. The red and blue bars indicate the genic regions on plus and minus strands, respectively. The gray bar indicate the unknown nucleotides (Ns). The region from 160 kb to 200 kb on the BAC sequence corresponded to the region with unknown nucleotides on Rmu_sc0000110.1. On the other hand, the region from 20 kb to 120 kb was not similar, which encoded TIR-NBR-LRR resistance genes. The BAC clone encodes TIR-NBS-LRR resistance genes, and the genome region of TIR-NBS-LRR resistance genes tend to be rearranged.46 As the strain of the BAC clone (breeding line 88/124-46) is different from our target, the non-conserved region of the BAC clone could be caused by genome rearrangement. However, the half region on 3’ terminal without TIR-NBS-LRR genes on the BAC sequence was conserved well. Moreover, 12,003 of 12,649 (94.8%) of EST sequences of R. hybrida, 1,455 of 1,936 (75.1%) of EST sequences from R. lucieae, and 5,040 of 5,978 (84.3%) of EST sequences in R. virginiana were mapped onto RMU_r2.0, respectively.Authenticity of the assembled genome sequence was also verified by use of CEGMA33 and BUSCO34 programs. The results of CEGMA and BUSCO were shown in Supplementary Table S5. Of the 248 core genes, 228 (91.9%) were completely conserved, while 15 (6.1%) were partially conserved, according to the CEGMA output. In contrast, 845 of the 956 genes defined in BUSCO program (88.4%) were classified as ‘complete single-copy.’ 348 genes (36.4%) were categorized as ‘complete duplicated,’ 40 (4.2%) were classified as ‘fragmented,’ and 71 genes (7.4%) were classified as ‘missing’ when analysed by BUSCO. The 91.9% and 88.4% of the genes defined by CEGMA and BUSCO were classified into complete structure, which indicate that the genes were conserved with high rates judged from the status of the genome assembly. In BUSCO analysis, 348 (36.4%) complete duplicated genes were detected. This high rate might be due to the high heterozygosity in RMU_r2.0. These results indicated that the core genes and single-copy orthologous genes might be conserved in RMU_r2.0. The core genes duplicated in RMU_r2.0 might be derived from the contigs separated by heterozygosity.3.2. Characteristic features of the rose genomeThe known and unique repetitive sequences identified in RMU_r2.0 are summarized in Supplementary Table S6. Total length of the known repeats was 417,242,576 bp (56.4% of the total) and in which Class I LTR elements were frequently present. In contrast, the unique repeats that have not been sequenced were newly identified in our analysis; the total length of these was 290,260,400 bp (39.2% of the total).According to the mapping results for RNA-Seq reads, 3,622,550 of 5,123,157 read pairs (70.7%) were mapped onto the draft genome sequence (RMU_r2.0). The training set for R. multiflora was constructed by BRAKER1,35 and used for gene prediction by Augustus 3.0.3.47 As a result, we predicted 178,512 genes on the genome sequence. According to the BLAST search against the NCBI NR database and by domain searches against InterPro, 67, 380 genes were selected with support by sequence alignment evidence. The first gene set was called after RMU_r2.0.cds, and second one was called after RMU_r2.0.braker1.cds. The statistics of the predicted genes are summarized in Supplementary Table S7. The total length of the CDSs was 66,058,172 bp with 45.9% GC content. This number of CDSs was higher compared with other Rosaceae plants, which may be caused by the presence of genes derived from duplicated contigs due to heterozygous genome regions that self incompatibility of R. multiflora results in. Kajitani et al. simulated the genome assembly of Caenorhabditis elegans with various levels of heterozygosity in Illumina reads ranged from 0.1 to 2.0%, and they indicated that the lengths of the contigs and scaffolds were shorter as higher heterozygosity.48 This means that the genes would be partial in the case of high heterozygosity. The gene name was prefixed with a seven-digit identifier followed by scaffold or contig number, for example, Rmu_ssc0000001.1_g000001.1. According to the presence of start or stop codons, genes were tagged as partial (with start or stop codons or without start or stop codons) or pseudogenes (presence of stop codons in CDS). Genes less than 50 amino acids were tagged as short. Genes having similarity to NR database entries by BLAST with E-values =1E-20 and identity =70% were tagged with ‘f,’ and those with E-values =1E-20 and identity <70% were tagged with ‘p.’ Genes having hits against InterPro with E-values =1.0 were labeled with ‘d.’ In RMU_r2.0.braker1.cds, genes having similarity to transposable elements were tagged with ‘TE.’ The number of genes with TE tag was 46,505. In RMU_r2.0.cds, the numbers of the tags ‘/fd (tags f and d),’ ‘/pd (tags p and d),’ ‘/f-,’ ‘/p-,’ and ‘/-d’ were 24,121, 16,461, 2,416, 5, 259, and 6,636. The numbers of the tags for partial genes ‘/partial/fd,’ ‘/partial/pd,’ ‘/partial/f,’ ‘/partial/p,’ ‘/partial/d’ were 6,842, 2,067, 1,240, 900, 1,438, respectively. The numbers of 5.8 S, 18 S, and 25 S rRNA genes were 4, 22, and 31, respectively. The tRNA and rRNA genes predicted in R. multiflora, F. vesca, and P. persica are compared in Supplementary Tables S8 and S9, respectively. The distributions of KOG functional categories of R. multiflora, F. vesca, and P. persica were similar (Supplementary Fig. S3). The numbers of the genes mapped onto KEGG metabolic pathways classified into ‘1. Metabolism’ are shown in Supplementary Table S10. The 17,677 genes (26.2%) of R. multiflora were mapped onto 346 of the 476 metabolic pathways in the KEGG database, whereas the 8,262 (24.6%), 11,710 (39.3%), 12,753 (48.2%), and 12,934 (46.7%) genes of F. vesca, M. × domestica, P. persica, and A. thaliana were mapped onto 344, 342, 344, and 345 pathways, respectively. The pathways were categorized as to which genes in the R. multiflora genome were uniquely mapped and were as follows: ‘Ascorbate and aldarate metabolism’ in ‘1.1. Carbohydrate metabolism,’ ‘Methane metabolism’ in ‘1.2 Energy metabolism,’ ‘Riboflavin metabolism’ in ‘1.8 Metabolism of cofactors and vitamins,’ ‘Monoterpenoid biosynthesis’ in ‘1.9 Metabolism of terpenoids and polyketides,’ ‘Isoquinoline alkaloid biosynthesis’ in ‘1.10 Biosynthesis of other secondary metabolites.’Pink- to red-flower colors of roses are derived from cyanidin or pelargonidin glucosides belonging to anthocyanins, a class of colored flavonoids (Supplementary Fig. S4). Rose flowers do not contain the delphinidin or flavone that is common in blue or violet flowers. Anthocyanin biosynthesis leading to anthocyanidin 3-glucoside is well conserved in higher plants.49 The R. multiflora genome contains amino acid sequences exhibiting high identity to reported biosynthetic enzymes (Supplementary Fig. S4).R. multiflora petals contain large amounts of kaempferol (3.975 ± 0.183 mg/g fresh petals), small quantities of quercetin (0.109 ± 0.014), and cyanidin (0.001 ± 0.001). Flavones and 3', 5'-hydroxylated flavonoids such as delphinidin and myricetin were not detected. The flavonoid profiles indicate the presence of flavonol synthase (FLS) and flavonoid 3'-hydroxylase (F3'H) (Supplementary Fig. S4) and the absence of flavonoid 3’,5’-hydroxylase (F3'5'H) and flavone synthase (FNS) in R. multiflora. Genomic genes corresponding to FLS and F3'H were identified in the genome (Supplementary Fig. S4), and those corresponding to F3'5'H and FNS were not found. The genes involved in regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis and vacuolar transport will be reported separately. The flavonoid biosynthetic pathway includes plural cytochromes P450 (P450) and UDP-sugar dependent glucosyltrasnferases/glycosyltransferases (GT). The R. multiflora genome contains 677 P450 and 507 GT ORFs in the scaffold sequences of RMU_r2.0. These numbers exceed those in other plant genomes, confirming that the R. multiflora genome is heterogeneous. Many GT and P450 genes are found to form clusters in the same scaffolds. Rmu_sc0005080.1 contains 11 GT genes and Rmu_sc0000698.1 contains 10 P450 genes (Supplementary Tables S11 and S12). Such clusters of P450 and GT genes are revealed in Glycyrrhiza uralensis.50 P450 and GT co-localize in eight scaffolds in G. uralensis and in four scaffolds of the R. multiflora genome (Supplementary Table S13).Rose floral scent compounds are mainly benzenoids such as 2-phenylethanol (2PE) and terpenoids, including geraniol. Scent compounds of modern roses are derived from their ancestral wild roses. 2PE is synthesized by two pathways: one is via aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (AADC)51 and phenylacetaldehyde reductase (PAR) in winter52 and the other is via phenylpyruvate decarboxylase (PPDC) in summer.6 The biosynthetic pathway of floral scent compounds, the relevant enzymes, and corresponding R. multiflora genes are summarized in Supplementary Fig. S5. R. multiflora predominantly produces 2PE but not 3, 5-dimethoxytoluene (DMT) or 1, 3, 5-trimethoxybenzene (TMB).53 2PE has a rose-like floral note and is one of the key scent compounds in roses.51 Genes corresponding to AADC, PAR, and PPDC are found in the genome (Supplementary Fig. S5). Eugenol synthase and eugenol methyltransferase genes were also found.The ‘tea scent’ compound of tea roses has been shown to be DMT, which is derived from R. chinensis and synthesized by catalysis of two closely related orcinol O-methyltransferases.54 Phenolic methyl ethers such as DMT or TMB, the characteristic ‘tea scent’ compounds of tea roses, have an earthy and spicy note.54 Only one orcinol methyltransferase gene (Rmu_sc0002707.1_g000004.1) was found in the R. multiflora genome, while Chinese roses producing DMT and TMB contain two closely related orcinol methyltransferase (OOMT1 and OOMT2) genes.54 This is consistent with the absence of DMT or TMB in R. multiflora. It has been suggested that R. chinensis OOMT1 contains a tyrosine residue at amino acid 127, whereas OOMT2 has a phenylalanine residue at this position.54 It has been suggested that OOMT1 does not catalyze 3-methoxy-5-hydroxytoluene (Supplementary Fig. S5) due to structural hindrance by the hydroxyl group of the tyrosine residue but OOMT2 does.54 The gene Rmu_sc0002707.1_g000004.1 encoding phenylalanine at this position may be indicative of the presence of OOMT2 catalyzing methylation of 3-methoxy-5-hydroxytoluene. Terpenoids are the largest floral scent group and are synthesized from prenyl diphosphate precursors by terpene synthases. In particular, monoterpenes (C10) such as geraniol or linalool, which are synthesized from geranyl diphosphate (GPP) and have flower-like notes, are major scent components in some modern roses.55 Although several genes encoding linalool, nerolidol, or a-pinene synthase homologues were found here, these compounds are not known to produce in R. multiflora flowers. It is interesting that R. multiflora contains two genomic genes encoding nucleoside diphosphate linked some moiety X hydrolase 1 (NUDX1) which is suggested to be involved in an alternative pathway5 to synthesize geraniol in spite of the absence of geraniol and its derivatives in R. multiflora. Carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase 1 (CCD1) cleaves ß-carotene at the 9–10 and the 9'–10' positions and generates two ß-ionones (C13 product), which has violet-like notes.56 The CCD1 gene leading to ß-ionone was also assigned (Supplementary Fig. S5).The ABCDE model has been developed for identification of different floral organs, namely sepals, petals, stamens, and carpels, and these organs are categorized as so-called A-class for sepal and petal specification, B-class for petal and stamen specification, C-class for stamen and carpel specification, D-class for carpel and ovule specification, and E-class for sepal, petal, stamen, and carpel specification by homeotic genes (mostly MADS-box-genes).57 Until now, 11 MADS-box-genes have been identified from wild and cultivated roses: class A genes RhAP1-1, RhAP1-2, and RhFUL58; class B genes MASAKO BP, MASAKO B3, and MASAKO euB359,60; class C/D genes MASAKO C1 and MASAKO D161; and class E genes RhSEP3, MASAKO S1, and MASAKO S3.62,63 Attenuated MASAKO C1 (RhAG) expression under low temperature condition causes an additional petal and petaloid stamens formation in cultivated rose,64 and severe reduction of MASAKO C1 expression was observed sterilized (anemone type) R. luciae flowers by our analysis (Supplementary Fig. S6). However, the R. multiflora MASAKO C1 (Rmu_sc0003469.1_g000007.1) have an intact open reading frame without a frame shift or transposon insertion. This is consistent with its normal flower phenotype.R. multiflora contains 94 MADS-box genes, including three class A, four class B, two class C/D, one class D, five class E, and three SHORT VEGETATIVE PHASE (SVP) genes (Supplementary Table S14). The 15 class ABCDE genes belonged to two clades consisting of class B, and class A, C/D and E except for one class D (Rmu_sc0000512.1_g000020.1) and one class E (SEP4) (Rmu_sc0003558.1_g000005.1) (Supplementary Fig. S7).The everblooming characteristic is one of the most important in modern roses and originated from everblooming sport of R. chinensis. A retrotransposon insertion in the KSN (terminal flower 1 homologue) gene resulted in this characteristic.65 Although Rmu_sc0010986.1_g000002.1 protein exhibited two amino acid residue differences from R. chinensis KSN protein and the R. multiflora KSN gene has a shorter first intron and a longer third intron than the R. chinensis KSN gene (Supplementary Fig. S8), no retrotransposon insertion is found in the Rmu_sc0010986.1_g000002.1 sequence. This is consistent with once flowering phenotype of R. multiflora.Fully extended petals and a long vase life are prerequisites for increasing the ornamental value of rose flowers. For extending petals, expansion of the petal cells plays a pivotal role. Expansins, XTHs and aquaporins participate in this process by loosening the cell wall or mediating influx of water into cells.66 Studies in Arabidopsis and other model plants disclose that these three proteins comprise a multigene superfamily. In rose, three aquaporin, four expansin and four XTHs genes have been identified as relevant to the expansion of petal cells.67–71BLAST and keyword search identified 65 aquaporins, 47 expansins and 60 XTHs (Supplementary Tables S15–17). In aquaporins, 55 out of 65 genes were predicted to have at least two transmembrane helix, which is conserved in aquaporin homologues (Supplementary Table S15). Through the phylogenetic analysis aquaporins excluding seven genes annotated with partial by Augustus 3.0.3 classified into 17 plasma membrane intrinsic proteins, 11 tonoplast intrinsic proteins, 10 nodulin 26-like intrinsic proteins, 6 small basic intrinsic proteins (SIPs) and 4 X intrinsic proteins (Supplementary Fig. S12 and S15). Similarly, expansins annotated with InterProScan accession PR01225 or PR01226 were classified into 3 subfamilies as expected (Supplementary Fig. S9 and Supplementary Table S16). RNA-Seq analysis predicted that 21 aquaporins, 13 expansins and 22 XTHs were expressed in the flower bud, among which 10 genes show particularly high expression level (RPKM > 50) (Supplementary Figs S9–S12 and Supplementary Tables S15–S17). Because seven highly expressed genes were not clustered with known rose genes, it may be interesting to investigate whether these genes actually act as a novel regulator for the expansion of petal cells in rose in the future analysis.3.3. Comparative genomicsThe genes predicted in R. multiflora, F. vesca, P. persica, M. × domestica were compared by a clustering method using OrthoMCL.44 In R. multiflora, the 67,380 genes were classified into intrinsic and partial genes and were used for this comparison. The number of clusters is shown in Supplementary Fig. S13. In the common region, 7,665 clusters were included. In the clusters, 18,956, 10,877, 13,187, and 14,069 genes were included for R. multiflora, F. vesca, P. persica, and M. × domestica, respectively. The number of clusters shared in common in R. multiflora and F. vesca, R. multiflora and P. persica, and R. multiflora and M. × domestica were 1,287, 904, and 241, respectively. This indicates that R. multiflora is closely related to F. vesca, P. persica, and M. × domestica in a stepwise manner. The distances corresponded well to the phylogenetic relationship in Rosaceae reported by Xiang et al.72 The number of clusters uniquely found in R. multiflora were 2.5 times (3,482 in R. multiflora/1,397 in F. vesca) higher than that in F. vesca. This was due to the heterozygosity in R. multiflora. In addition, the number of genes in the clusters uniquely found in R. multiflora was 3.3 times (14,663 in R. multiflora/4,482 in F. vesca) higher than that in F. vesca, which means that the duplicated or partial genes were included in R. multiflora more than in F. vesca.To investigate possible syntenic relationships among R. multiflora and other rosaceous taxa genomes, the status of conservation of relative gene positions was surveyed using the scaffolds of rose genomic sequences. Among the 3,932 scaffolds with five or more predicted genes, conservation of the relative positions of three or more genes was observed in 1,968 scaffolds (50%) and 2,312 scaffolds (59%) against genes predicted in the F. vesca and P. persica genomic sequences, respectively (Supplementary Table S18). It appears that a significant degree of micro-synteny can be expected within the family Rosaceae.By anchoring scaffolds of rose genome with SSR marker information in the recent integrated genetic map of roses,73–75 macro-syntenic relationships between R. multiflora and other Rosaceae genomes were investigated. A total of 160 scaffolds, with 17.9 Mb total length, were anchored on the seven linkage groups of R. multiflora. Among the 127 markers with corresponding scaffolds, 33 markers (26%) correspond to two scaffolds, which presumably indicated the presence of redundant scaffolds corresponding to heterozygous alleles (Supplementary Table S19). The micro-syntenic relations identified on the anchored scaffolds revealed macro-level synteny between R. multiflora and F. vesca, with entire chromosome level synteny between R. multiflora linkage group (RG) 1 and F. vesca chromosome (FC)7, RG4 and FC4, RG5 and FC3, RG6 and FC2, and RG7 and FC5. A single large translocation was evident, as scaffolds anchored on RG2 showed syntenic relation to either FC1 or the top portion of FC6 and those on RG3 showed syntenic relation to bottom portion of FC6. Macro-syntenic relationships identified between R. multiflora and P. persica corresponded well to the syntenic relationship between F. vesca and P. persica,8 that is, RG1 and the P. persica linkage group (PG)2, RG2-PG3/PG7, RG3-PG6, RG4-PG1, PG5-PG4/PG6, PG6-PG1/PG8, and PG7PG1/PG5.To examine molecular similarities among wild rose, R. multiflora, and cultivated rose, R. hybrida, transcriptome reads of R. hybrida cultivar ‘Rote Rose’ were mapped to our R. multiflora genome sequence. A total of 55,086 R. multiflora genes were mapped by 20 or more R. hybrida transcriptome reads, and 198,807 SNPs were identified on these mapped regions, corresponding to 201 Mb (~27%) of the genome. Although the average SNP density could be calculated as one in every 1.01 kb, a higher SNP density might be expected across the entire genome if nontranscribed regions were also included in this analysis.3.4.

IntroductionSoybean, Glycine max (L.) Merr., is the most important legume and is the fourth crop next to rice, wheat and maize in terms of world crop production. The estimated size of the soybean genome is 1.1 Gb.1 The genome sequence of the US cultivar Williams 82, Glyma0, became available on the Phytozome in January 2008. The first chromosome-scale assembly, Glyma1.01, became available in December 2008, and a new assembly, Wm82.a2.v1, was released in January 2014 (https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov/pz/portal.html (1 November 2017, date last accessed)). According to the Phytozome web site, annotations of some genes have been improved on the basis of RNA-seq data and the number of unmapped scaffolds has been reduced by using new assembly methods and constructing high-density linkage maps. Two other soybean chromosome-scale assemblies are available from the NCBI web site (Glycine_max_v1.1 and Glycine_max_v2.0). However, gene names, numbers and genomic positions are not comparable among different assemblies and are sometimes very confusing to users. In the present study, we discuss only the Glyma1.01 and Wm82.a2.v1 assemblies at the Phytozome web site. A reference genome sequence is a versatile tool with which to characterize the relationships between genes and agronomically important traits. However, additional genome information and experimental materials suitable for genetic characterization are also needed. New next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are expected to yield genomic sequences of a wide variety of soybean germplasms.2 In addition, the development of soybean mutant libraries and the identification of mutants related to agronomically important traits from their phenotypes and reverse-genetic approaches based on NGS are expected to provide new genetic resources.3 The efficient use of this information and experimental materials is necessary for further soybean breeding.Recent re-sequencing information has enabled the development of molecular markers for soybean gene discovery and breeding. Among molecular markers, simple sequence repeats (SSRs) and microsatellites are useful tools because of their abundance, multi-allelic features, co-dominant inheritance, high variability and ease of analysis. SSR markers developed by previous studies4,5 have been widely used in soybean breeding programs worldwide and are available from SoyBase (https://www.soybase.org/ (1 November 2017, date last accessed)). A genetic linkage map is essential for soybean chromosome assembly. The reference sequence Glyma1.01 was assembled on the basis of a consensus linkage map,1 and Wm82.a2.v1 (Glyma2) on the basis of high-density linkage maps.6 However, chromosomal translocation and inversion in soybean have been reported with cytogenic analysis7 and karyotyping based on fluorescence in situ hybridization has also identified translocations and inversions in several soybean cultivars.8 Comparison of high-density linkage maps is expected to be deepen with our knowledge about chromosomal structure in soybean cultivars.Soybean is an important source of traditional staple foods such as tofu, natto, miso and soy sauce in Japan. The unique cuisine, geographical and historical isolation of Japan probably shaped distinct agro-morphological characteristics of Japanese soybeans from those of continental soybeans. Since Enrei is a major cultivar (9% of total soybean cultivation area in Japan in 2014) with seeds of high quality for food processing, previous study9 sequenced the whole genome of Enrei as a representative Japanese cultivar. The sequencing average read coverage at a locus was 22.2×, and 1,659,041 SNPs and 344,418 insertions/deletions between the Enrei assembly and the reference sequence of Williams 82 were identified. One 4-coumaroyl-CoA-ligase gene (out of 10 genes in the William 82 reference genome), seven chalcone synthase genes (out of 24 genes), three chalcone isomerase genes (out of 16 genes), one flavonol synthase gene (out of 4 genes) and six dihydroflavonol 4-reductase genes (out of 10 genes), those predicted as anthocyanin and flavonoid biosynthesis genes in Williams 82 genome, were not found in the Enrei genome. Hence, the accumulation of genome and marker information for a wide range of soybean elite cultivars and the development of experimental resources to facilitate the evaluation of useful genes that differ from Williams 82 orthologs are necessary to utilize a wide range of the genetic diversity in soybean breeding.Peking is a landrace that has been extensively used in a breeding programs because of its resistance to the soybean cyst nematode Heterodera glycines.10 In 1906, the accession was introduced from Beijing, China, into the USA by the US Department of Agriculture (USDA).11 Peking is also resistant to soybean mosaic virus,12 peanut mottle virus,13 bacterial blight,14 frogeye leaf spot (Cercospora sojina),15 soybean dwarf disease,16 soybean stem canker,17 reniform nematode Rotylenchulus reniformis,18,Phytophthora stem and root rot19 and germinates well under wet conditions.20,21 However, the genes responsible for these traits, except for resistance to cyst nematode and phytophthora stem and root rot, remain uncharacterized.Many quantitative trait loci (QTLs) related to important agronomic traits such as flowering time, plant height, maturity, seed weight, yield, seed nutrients, seed oil contents and seed protein are summarized in SoyBase. Isolation and characterization of genes for these traits are very important in facilitating MAS with DNA markers tightly linked to a locus or nucleotide polymorphism suitable for distinguishing functional alleles. However, the development of experimental material suitable for positional cloning is time consuming. Among such materials, ‘heterozygous inbred families22,’ and ‘residual heterozygous lines23,’ have been used to analyze QTLs as single Mendelian factors for fine mapping. In addition, series of near-isogenic lines (NILs), which have a common genetic background, are advantageous for QTL evaluation. First NIL library, which consisted of a series of NILs, currently referred to as chromosomal segment substitution lines (CSSLs), each having different chromosomal segments originating from a wild donor parent in the genetic background of cultivated tomato, was developed and used for identification of a yield-related QTL.24 CSSLs were developed in many plant species, including tomato,24 Arabidopsis,25 rice26), barley,27 peanut28 rye,29 lettuce30 and wild soybean.31 In soybean, one genetic locus from wild soybean increasing yield was also reported.32 Genomic sequences indicate that the genetic diversity of cultivated soybean is narrow compared with that of landraces and wild soybean (G. soja).33 Although CSSLs carrying segments of the wild soybean genome have been developed,31 the availability of CSSLs from out of Japan is limited, and the development of CSSLs using various combinations of soybean germplasms would provide novel breeding materials and increase genetic diversity.In the present study, using progeny from a cross between the leading Japanese cultivar, Enrei, and the Chinese landrace Peking, we developed a high-density linkage map and CSSLs. Enrei is a representative Japanese cultivar with high quality for food processing, whereas Peking is an excellent Chinese germplasm resistant to various diseases and stresses. The genetic distance between these parents is much larger than that between Japanese landraces and Enrei but smaller than wild soybean and Enrei.34 In addition to re-sequencing information,9,35 genes controlling flowering time and growth habit have been characterized for these parents.36 Therefore, genomic resources developed in the present study may help to characterize agronomically important genes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsA total of 32 Soybean lines including 16 Japanese breeding varieties, two USA breeding varieties, six Japanese landraces, four exotic landraces and four wild soybean accessions were used to identify SSR polymorphisms (Supplementary Table S1). A cross between Enrei [G. max; accession number in National Agriculture and Food Research Organization (NARO) Genebank, Japan: GmJMC025] as the female parent and Peking (GmWMC084) as the male parent was performed in 2005, and an F2 mapping population was developed. The F2 population (189 plants) and 20 plants of each parent were grown with an inter-row spacing of 80 cm and a hill spacing of 30 cm in the field at NARO in Tsukuba, Ibaraki, Japan (36°01'25.6”N 140°06'59.1”E). All experimental populations were evaluated at the same location. Seeds were sown on 30 May 2007. Images of the parent plants are shown in Fig. 1. The breeding scheme is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. Seeds and mature plants of Enrei and Peking. The ruler is in centimeters.Seeds and mature plants of Enrei and Peking. The ruler is in centimeters.2.2. Development of a backcross population and CSSLsEnrei was used as the recurrent parent and Peking as the donor parent. Pollen from F1 plants was used to pollinate Enrei flowers before blooming, and >1,000 BC1F1 seeds were obtained in 2006. All BC1F1 seeds were sown, and 999 BC1F1 plants were crossed with Enrei to produce BC2F1 in 2007 and BC3F1 in 2008. BC3F2 seeds were obtained by self-pollinating each BC3F1 plant; the BC3F2 population (999 plants) was sown on 16 June 2010. Next year, CSSLs (103 lines) were selected from the BC3F2 population (as described below) and grown under natural day length in the same field. CSSLs were sown on 24 June 2011 (10 plants per line) and on 27 June 2012 (4–20 plants per line). Selection of CSSLs was based on the data obtained from 320 SSR markers that covered all chromosomes evenly. The proportion and length of donor chromosomal segments were calculated from genetic distances between DNA markers, and the positions of recombination breakpoints in all chromosomes were calculated in individual lines. Candidate lines with low proportions of donor chromosomal segments per chromosome were first selected, and then 103 CSSLs were selected so that the donor segments of 4–6 lines covered each chromosome.2.3. Phenotypic evaluationDescription of investigated traits, broard sence heritability and number of QTLs detected in the present studyaPartially confirmed QTLs are included.Description of investigated traits, broard sence heritability and number of QTLs detected in the present studyaPartially confirmed QTLs are included.2.4. Total genomic DNA extractionDNA of parents and F2 plants was extracted from fresh leaves (3 g) by a Cetyltrimethylammonium Bromide (CTAB) protocol.38 DNA of cultivars and BC3F2 plants was isolated as described previously.39 DNA was quantified on a fluorescence microplate reader (ARVO; Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer‘s instructions and was adjusted to 50 and 20 ng/µl for SSR and SNP analyses, respectively.2.5. SSR marker analysisMarker design: SSR core motifs in Glyma1.01 and in large scaffolds (>100 kb) of Glyma0 were extracted in the read2Marker program with default parameters.40 Primer pairs to amplify the core motifs were designed in Primer3 software.41 Three types of primer pairs with different amplicon sizes (small, 80–210 bp; medium, 211–340 bp; large, 341–500 bp) were designed; the parameter settings were Opt_Tm = 60, Min_Tm = 53, Max_Tm = 70 and Max_Poly_X = 3. Sequences of the primer pairs were searched against Glyma1.01 to determine the number of binding sites, amplicon sizes and locations in Genome tester software42 with default parameters until a single amplicon was obtained (Supplementary Table S2). The SSR motifs that were consistent with BARC soybean potential SSR markers in SoyBase and EST-SSR markers43 are denoted in Supplementary Table S2.Detection with fluorescently labelled primers: Primers were labelled with 6-FAM, HEX or NED fluorescent dyes. Multiplex PCR mixture (6 µl) contained DNA (10 ng/µl), 0.1 unit/µl of Taq DNA polymerase (Finnzymes), 1× Optimized Taq buffer, primer mix (0.02–0.2 µM each), 200 µM dNTPs and 1.6 M betaine. PCR was performed on a GeneAmp 9700 amplifier (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA) as follows: 1 cycle of initial denaturation at 95 °C for 2 min; 40 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55 °C for 2 min and extension at 72 °C for 1 min; and final extension at 72 °C for 3 min. The PCR product was diluted with water (1 : 10), and 1 µl was added to a mixture of Hi-Di formamide (10 µl) and GeneScan 400HD ROX size standard (0.2 µl). The sample was separated on an ABI3730 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems). PCR fragments detected simultaneously with three dyes were resolved in ABI GeneMapper v. 4.0 software (Applied Biosystems). To measure allelic size, relative fluorescent units and sizes (bp) of the highest stutter peaks of the 32 accessions were sorted by peak size rounded to integer numbers (Supplementary Table S3).Detection with modified universal fluorescently labelled (UFL) primer: The UFL method44 was modified to attain multiplex amplification. Short polylinker sequences from the pBluescript vector were used as queries in blastn searches45 against Glyma1.01; the parameter settings were word_size = 7, evalue = 0.1 and perc_identity = 90. Three oligonucleotide tag sequences that did not show any hits in the soybean genome were used instead of the original M13 universal primer and were fluorescently labelled: 5'-CCACCGACGTGTCGCAC with 6-FAM, CCGTGCAGTCCGTCAGC with HEX and GGTGGCGACTCCTGGAG with NED (all dyes from Applied Biosystems). The concentrations of the oligonucleotide tag sequence (0.04 µM), 5'-tagged forward primer (0.04 µM) and unlabelled reverse primer (0.4 µM each) per marker were optimized to attain multiplex amplification. PCR conditions, detection of PCR fragments, genotyping and allele sizing were as described above.Genotyping of the mapping population: PCR conditions were optimized to attain multiplex amplification for 12–18 fluorescently labelled SSR markers and 9–12 UFL SSR markers. Multiplex PCR mixture (3–5 µl) contained total DNA (50 ng/µl), 1× Multiplex PCR Mix (Qiagen), 1× Q solution and primer mix (described above). The following conditions were used: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 15 min; 18 cycles total of 94 °C for 30 s and 3 cycles each of 68, 66, 64, 62, 60 and 58 °C for 3 min; then 40 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 3 min at 55 °C and 1 min at 72 °C; and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. The primer concentration for fluorescently labelled SSR markers can be reduced to 1/10. Genotyping conditions were as for SSR marker detection.2.6. SNP marker analysisSequence-tagged sites containing SNP information developed46 were used as queries in blastn searches against Glyma1.01 with default parameters. Multiplex assays for 1,000 randomly selected SNPs distributed throughout the genome (Supplementary Table S3) were designed to amplify low-copy sequences in Sequenom Assay Design 3.1 software (Sequenom). The Sequenom MassARRAY system47 was used for SNP genotyping. Multiplex PCR followed by template-directed single base extension at each SNP site was conducted with a MassARRAY iPLEX Gold kit (Sequenom) following the manufacturer‘s protocol. The genotypes were determined in MassARRAY Typer 4.0 software (Sequenom).2.7. Linkage map construction and QTL detectionThe linkage maps of F2 and BC3F2 populations were constructed by using JoinMap v. 4.0 software.48 The logarithm of odds (LOD) threshold for grouping of DNA markers was 4.0. The marker order was determined using the maximum likelihood mapping algorithm. The recombination frequency was converted into genetic distance (cM) using the Haldane mapping function. Marker genotypes were examined by eye to check whether the pattern of marker segregation changed gradually at each round of map construction in order to ensure the correct marker order. When a discrepancy between the marker order and chromosome assembly was found, additional markers were integrated into the position to confirm the discrepancies. QTLs were analyzed by composite interval mapping implemented in the R/qtl package49 with threshold values (P < 0.1) that were calculated by the 1,000-permutation test for each trait. The detected peak positions were used for the ‘refineqtl’ and ‘fitqtl’ functions to estimate the maximum-likelihood position for each QTL model, the effects of each QTL and genetic variance. The phenotypic values of CSSLs and Enrei were evaluated in 2011 and 2012 using the Tukey-Kramer test in R v. 3.3.1 software50 with significance level, P < 0.01.2.8. Comparison of the linkage map with the chromosome assemblyThe positions of primer sequences of mapped markers on Glyma1.01 and Wm82.a2.v1 were estimated by similarity searches using Genome tester and/or blastn described above. The first base position of either forward or reverse primer sequences on the coordinates of the chromosome assembly and the size and number of expected PCR products are listed in Supplementary Table S3. When multiple polymorphic fragments are amplified by a primer set, we added the 0.1, 0.2, 0.3 suffixes after name of the marker mapped to different linkage groups. In the comparison of the linkage map with the chromosome assembly, we omitted markers being far from the expected position based on information of surrounding markers and then used only information of the marker position of chromosome assembly which marker designed in Glyma1.01 and Wm82.a2.v1. Thirty-one public SSR markers for which only information on primer sequences but difficult to locate precise position on chromosome assemblies were not included. The Marey map approach51 was used to visualize the corresponding positions between the linkage map and the genome assemblies. Genetic positions of the markers were interpolated using the cubic spline method with default parameters settings in MareyMap version 1.3.3.523. Results and discussion3.1. DNA markersSSR markers has been used in MAS because of multi allelic behavior, easy handling and low cost. Information on their polymorphism, genotyping quality and genetic positions is useful for marker selection. We identified 171,915 SSR loci (62,739 di-, 41, 696 tri-, 154 tetranucleotide and 67,326 compound loci) in the soybean reference sequence Glyma1.01.1 Because extended regions in the soybean genome are duplicated as a result of ancient polyploidization,1 novel primer pairs for 148,569 SSR loci were designed to amplify single PCR products to avoid analytical complexity (Supplementary Table S2). Polymorphisms of 2,235 SSR loci and that of previously developed 982 SNP markers46 were evaluated in 32 soybean germplasms (Supplementary Table S3). Sizes of amplified PCR product containing SSRs and nucleotides for SNPs, the number of PCR products, polymorphic information content and genetic positions estimated from the high-density linkage map are listed in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3.3.2. High-density linkage mapA high-density linkage map was constructed by using a single F2 mapping population. Genomic SSR markers,4,5 EST-SSR markers43 and the new SSR markers described above were incorporated into the map to cover the entire genome. The map spans 2885.7 cM and contains 1,667 SSR and 510 SNP markers (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2, left white bars); the average marker distance is 1.3 cM and maximum distance is 6.8 cM. Severe segregation distortion (P = 0.001) was observed for the markers on Gm06 (115.5–118.4 cM, corresponding to 46.7–47.3 Mbp) and Gm11 (116.3–119.3 cM, 36.1–36.2 Mbp) (Fig. 2, blue lines). In these regions, the frequency of Peking alleles was less than that of Enrei alleles. A high-density genetic linkage map between Enrei and Peking (left) aligned with a physical map of Williams 82 (Glyma1.01) (right), with marker locations connected by black lines. The regions with suppressed recombination, shown on the same scale on the right, are connected with the linkage map by orange lines and may correspond to the pericentromeric regions. Red trapezoids indicate discrepancies between genetic and physical maps; blue bars indicate regions with severe segregation distortion. The discrepancies that have been resolved in the genome assembly Wm82.a2.v1 are indicated by red dot trapezoids.A high-density genetic linkage map between Enrei and Peking (left) aligned with a physical map of Williams 82 (Glyma1.01) (right), with marker locations connected by black lines.

The discrepancies that have been resolved in the genome assembly Wm82.a2.v1 are indicated by red dot trapezoids.We compared marker locations on the linkage map (Fig. 2, left white bars) with those on Glyma1.01 (Fig. 2, right black bars) and Wm82.a2.v1 assemblies (Supplementary Table S3). Because important flowering- and yield-related QTLs in the region of Gm11 (11.0–14.8 Mb) of Glyma1.01 assembly are absent on Chr. 11 of Wm82.a2.v1, we discussed based on the Glyma1.01 assembly. The corresponding region was found to be included in two unassigned scaffolds of Wm82.a2.v1 assembly, scaffold_21 and scaffold_32 (Supplementary Table S3). In total, 2,155 of 2,177 markers (99%) were anchored on Glyma1.01. The short-range order of most markers on the linkage map closely agreed with that of their physical positions in the genome assembly, but a wide range of regions differed at the distal ends of chromosomes. For example, reverse marker order on Gm05, Gm11, Gm13, Gm14 and Gm19 was observed at the distal ends of the corresponding linkage groups (Fig. 2, red rectangles). In particular, the orientation of the top of Gm13 (14.8–15.6 Mb) containing nucleolar organizer region (NOR)53 was reversed in our map. Similarly, by using fluorescent CentGm probes, the reverse orientation of this region was previously detected in a cytogenetic study of Peking.54 These large discrepancies have been resolved in Wm82.a2.v1,6 although some differences, especially on Chr. 05 (8.6–22.0 Mb) and Chr. 11 (11.1–28.0 Mb), remain. As for Chr. 11, the two unassigned scaffolds described above are not integrated into the two high density linkage maps,6 because no SNP marker to anchor the scaffolds is not available. In contrast, order of SNP markers in the region of Chr. 05 are consistent among the two maps, therefore, the discrepancy with information of the present map might reflect the genomic differences in different accessions. Thus, the differences in the present map provides information to identify regions in the genome assembly where additional information is required to resolve marker order and assign remaining scaffolds.3.3. Relationships between physical and genetic distancesIntegration of markers that have been used for MAS and QTL mapping by breeders and researchers into the high-density linkage map allowed us to determine relative genetic and physical relationships through marker positions. Corresponding position between the linkage map and the genome assembly was visualized by the Marey map approach.51 The corresponding physical distance to genetic distance was ~360 kb/cM, assuming a genome size of ~1.1 Gb, although positional biases (50 kb/cM–7 Mb/cM) were found. The ratio of physical to genetic distance varied considerably depending on the chromosomal region, and looked like a sigmoid curve. For example, the ratio in the middle regions of Gm06 (100–110 cM) and Gm11 (94–103 cM) was >10 times that in the other regions (Fig. 3). Such regions with highly suppressed recombination flanking the centromeres are termed the pericentromeres. In each chromosome, highly suppressed recombination between markers was observed in the pericentromere, but the extent of suppression differed among chromosomes (Fig. 2). A pair of markers in such regions would provide insufficient information on recombination for genetic mapping even if they are located physically far from each other in the reference sequence. Therefore, information on recombination frequency across the genome is useful for genome-wide association study and for marker choice for MAS and QTL mapping. We estimated the genetic positions of all markers from the Marey map (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). The choice of markers based on their genetic positions rather than their physical positions in the reference sequences would reduce the cost of MAS for breeding and QTL mapping.

Arrow indicates the location of the E1 gene.Surprisingly, low-recombination regions covered ~555 Mb (~60%) of the published soybean genome sequence and sometimes they formed patches in euchromatic regions (e.g. on Gm11 76.5–78.6 cM; Fig. 3). Interestingly, the distribution of low-recombination regions in all chromosomes coincided with the abundance of long terminal repeat retrotransposons reported in soybean.55 Gm07 and Gm16 had more than one apparent peak of suppressed recombination in addition to the pericentromeric regions.3.4. QTLs in F2 populationHigh-density genetic linkage maps have made it possible to genetically dissect flowering time differences between parents, and thus to better understand the genetic basis for soybean flowering by comparing previously reported flowering- and/or maturity-related QTLs. Both parents belong to soybean maturity group IV56; DFF was 48.2 for Enrei and 60.7 for Peking. The F2 population showed transgressive segregation (Supplementary Fig. S3), and the broad-sense heritability of DFF was 75.5%. Seven QTLs (qDFF, Table 2) for DFF were identified. Both parents had alleles that accelerated flowering; Enrei had such alleles on Gm10, Gm12, Gm16 and Gm19 and Peking on Gm06, Gm11 and Gm13. Despite the high genetic complexity of the F2 population, almost all phenotypic variation in DFF was explained (91.4%) by the four major QTLs (on Gm06, Gm10, Gm12 and Gm19) and three minor QTLs (on Gm11, Gm13, Gm16). Only qDFF_Gm06 was located close to the low-recombination region. In F2 population, 19 out of 21 QTLs (expect for qDFF_Gm13 and qPH_Gm10) showed higher LOD score than 1% significant level threshold value. Surprisingly, most QTLs for other traits (PH, NP, SWH, DH and RP) were clustered with QTLs for DFF (Table 2), suggesting two possibilities that the latter have pleiotropic effects on other traits or genes for these traits are clustered together.

For instance, the physical location of two major QTLs, qDFF_Gm19 and qDFF_Gm10, estimated from the Marey map was 47.6 Mb and 44.9 Mb, respectively. Genes responsible for E357 and E258 are located at ~47.5 Mb on Gm19 and ~44.7 Mb on Gm10, respectively. The estimated physical locations of the two QTLs differ from those of E2 and E3 by only ~200 kb. Thus, the positions of SSR markers and interpolated genetic distance provide great potential to narrow down the boundaries of genomic regions that include candidate genes.3.5. QTLs in BC3F2 populationNine agronomic traits (Table 1) of 999 BC3F2 individuals were evaluated and the average values of each trait was compared with those of the recurrent parent (Enrei); the average value of each trait of BC3F2 were almost the same as those of Enrei (Supplementary Table S4, Fig. S4). Whereas the effects of Peking alleles increase the phenotypic variance observed in BC3F2. Among the genetic variances (heritability) of all traits, some traits such as DFF, DFT and PH were highly heritable, whereas heritability of yield-related traits, such as TSW and SWH, were intermediate, and that of DH and RP was very low (Table 1). Enrei tends to suffer from green stem disorder, caused by biotic and abiotic stresses59; this disorder, which delays harvesting, would broaden the range of the values of maturity-related traits of the recurrent parent and the BC3F2 population and decrease the heritability of these traits.The linkage map was constructed for the BC3F2 population to perform QTL mapping for these nine traits. The genotype of each BC3F2 line was determined by using 320 SSR markers selected from the high-density genetic linkage map described above, so that they covered the whole genome (Supplementary Fig. S5). The ratios of Peking-homozygous (3.1%), heterozygous (6.3%) and Enrei-homozygous (90.6%) loci in the population coincided well with the theoretical ratios (3.3%, 6.0% and 89.1%, respectively). The map consisted of 20 linkage groups covering 2475.3 cM with an average interval of 8.3 cM, and showed a genetic order of DNA markers similar to that expected from the high-density linkage map of the F2 population.In total, 56 QTLs scattered over 12 chromosomes were identified from the positions of LOD peaks for the nine traits. Six QTLs for DFF, six for DFT, two for FP, nine for DH, eight for RP, four for PH, six for NP, seven for TSW and eight for SWH showed significant LOD scores. Among them, 53 QTLs (expect for qDH_Gm01, qDH_Gm17 and qNP_Gm16) showed higher LOD score than 1% significant level of threshold value (Table 2). Six out of seven QTLs for DFF detected in the F2 population were reproducible in the BC3F2 population. As in the F2 population, many QTLs for other traits were clustered with QTLs for DFF, suggesting that QTLs for flowering time strongly affect other traits. However, additional QTLs for maturity and yield traits were separate from DFF QTLs in the BC3F2 population.We previously characterized the sequences of the known flowering genes, E1–E4, in many soybean cultivars36; on this information, Enrei has E1, e2, e3 and E4 alleles, and Peking has E1, E2, E3 and E4 alleles. Therefore, we expected that only the E2 and E3 loci would segregate in the population; however, qDFF_Gm06 was identified in a region close to the E1 locus (Table 2). Allelic effects of qDFFs agreed well with the results of QTL analysis in the F2 population. In addition, two soybean orthologs of Arabidopsis Flowering locus T (FT), GmFT2a60 and GmFT5a61 delay flowering in cultivars adapted to northern Japan. The location of qDFF_Gm16 was very close to the GmFT5a locus, and the Peking allele delayed flowering.A major QTL for DFT, qDFT_Gm19, was identified close to the Dt1 locus. The Peking allele significantly delayed flowering of the top raceme. The dominant allele of Dt1, which is a homolog of Arabidopsis TERMINAL FLOWER 1, controls indeterminate growth habit in soybean.62 The growth habit of Peking is closer to that of a semi-determinate isoline (Dt1, Dt2) than to that of a determinate isoline (dt1, dt2) in top-leaf and stem traits, but the Peking allele is controlled by dt1-t, which is allelic to dt1.63 Together with the semi-determinate growth of Peking, delaying flowering of the top raceme will increase both the number of nodes on the main stem and plant height. The corresponding traits, NP and PH, were controlled by QTLs detected near the Dt1 locus (Fig. 4). The genetic variance of DFT and PH explained by the Dt1 locus accounted up to 55.3% and 45.7%, respectively, of total variance (Table 2), indicating that the Dt1 locus strongly affects these traits.

Marker genotypes: black, Peking homozygous; white, Enrei homozygous; gray, heterozygous. QTL positions on the right side are in black.The locations of QTLs for yield-related traits NP and TSW in the BC3F2 population were very similar to those of QTLs for DFF in the F2 population. The ratios of genetic variance explained by six flowering-time QTLs and the Dt1 locus were examined but the order of effects of qDFFs did not coincide with that of post-flowering including yield-related traits. For example, qRP_Gm11, detected at the same locus as qDFF_Gm11, had a larger additive effect on RP (-3.4 days) than on DFF (-1.2 days). Each QTL for DFF had a different effect on the phenotypic variance of other traits, likely reflecting functional differences between the underlying genes. Hence, dissection of these QTLs as single Mendelian factors would provide more precise information about their effects.Four QTLs for SWH were identified on Gm02, Gm08, Gm17 and Gm20, where no QTLs for DFF were identified. None of the QTLs from small-seeded Peking increased SWH. The Peking allele of qSWH_Gm08 had the strongest effect of decreasing SWH (10% of phenotypic variance in the BC3F2 population explained). Because this QTL is close to Rhg4, an important locus for cyst nematode resistance of Peking,64 pre-breeding of an Rhg4 NIL to remove such an unfavourable Peking allele is important for breeding of large-seeded cultivars. Previous study65 identified a QTL (qSW17-1OA) with stable effects on seed weight in diverse environments over several years. The genetic position of qSWH_Gm17 is likely to be the same as that of qSW17-1OA and some other QTLs in previous study (Table 2). The locations of qSWH_Gm20 and qTSW_Gm20 were close to that of Ln, which controls leaflet shape and seed size.66 The gene responsible for Ln is homologous to Arabidopsis JAGGED.67 Although most Peking alleles had negative effects on yield-related traits in the Enrei genetic background, two QTLs related to late flowering (qDFF_Gm10, qDFF_Gm19) and one QTL extending the reproductive period (qRP_Gm19) associated with increased TSW in this genetic background (Table 2).3.6. Development of CSSLs and confirmation of QTLsThe graphical genotypes of the selected 103 CSSLs are shown in Fig. 4. The average length (± standard deviation) of the donor chromosomal segment was 85.4 ± 42.1 cM for homozygous and 130.8 cM ± 59.6 cM for heterozygous alleles. A few donor segments other than the target segment remained in the genetic background of the recurrent parent; therefore, further backcrossing with MAS would be necessary to eliminate these extra segments. However, CSSLs harboring different donor chromosomal segments from Peking were still useful to dissect QTLs as single genetic factors and to evaluate the genetic effects of individual QTLs.Two-year evaluations of nine agronomic traits using 103 CSSLs revealed that 50 of these lines had at least one trait that was significantly different from that of Enrei by the Tukey-Kramer test (P < 0.01). Most lines whose donor segments contained QTLs originating from Peking showed significantly different phenotypes. These differences agreed well with the effects of QTLs identified in the BC3F2 population (Supplementary Table S5). Of the 57 QTLs detected in the F2 and BC3F2 populations, 49 were also detected in CSSLs (Table 1). Therefore, we considered that majority of QTLs reported in this study are highly reliable. Interestingly, four CSSLs B0704, B0804, B0816 and B0879 had the same genotype as Enrei at all DFF QTLs but had a significantly (P <0.01) different DFF from Enrei (Supplementary Table S5). The results indicate that the effect of a novel QTL appeared in the simple genetic background of a CSSL but was undetectable in the BC3F2 population. In 2011 and 2012, 36 CSSLs showed significant differences in TSW from Enrei; 27 of them had QTLs for DFF, RP and SWH, but genetic factors in the remaining lines were not identified. Increasing the number of plants used for evaluation or crossing with Enrei would be necessary to uncover the cause of the increase in TSW and to use this QTL in soybean breeding programs.We further evaluated the progeny of each line heterozygous for each of six flowering-time QTLs (E1, E2, E3, qDFF_Gm11, qDFF_Gm12 and GmFT5a) to evaluate whether the chromosomal segments from Peking contained flowering time QTLs. Progeny classification according to the genotypes of SSR markers near each QTL showed significant association between phenotypic values and QTL genotypes (data not shown). Representative graphical genotypes of two CSSLs harboring donor chromosomal segments that included qDFF_Gm11 (B0015 and B0676) and the effect of qDFF_Gm11 on the phenotype are shown in Fig. 5. Both lines differed significantly (P <0.01) from Enrei in RP (Fig. 5B). qDFF_Gm11 had the fifth strongest effect among seven DFF QTLs (Table 2), whereas qDFF_Gm11 had the strongest effect on RP among all RP QTLs. The decreased RP resulted in a clear difference in the maturity phenotype (Fig. 5C), and this QTL also affected TSW and SWH (Supplementary Table S4). Comparison of the effects of qDFF(qRP)_Gm11 on different traits suggests that the gene responsible for this QTL probably extends the pod-filling period. The results described above indicate that CSSLs developed in this study may help to dissect the genes underlying the detected QTLs into single genetic factors and provide breeding materials with the genetic background of an elite Japanese cultivar.

Novel flowering-related genesWe identified seven QTLs related to DFF in F2, BC3F2 populations and selected CSSLs (Table 2 and Supplementary Table S5). Among soybean maturity genes, the classical E1 locus has the strongest effect on flowering time.68 In response to photoperiod, a putative transcription factor encoded by E1 controls flowering time by regulating the expression of FT genes.69 The detection of qDFF_Gm06 close to E1 in the F2 and BC3F2 populations suggests that the E1 allele differs between Peking and Enrei. We assume that Peking has a recessive allele because of an early flowering effect of this QTL (Table 2). However, the coding region of Peking E1 is reported to be identical to that of Enrei E1.36 Thus, Peking may have a recessive allele different from the known one, because several different types of recessive alleles have been identified for soybean maturity genes, such as the E4 locus,70 and the promoter region of Peking has a high similarity to those of other cultivars with recessive e1 alleles.36 Alternatively, a novel gene affecting soybean flowering time and maturity may be located in this region. The qDFF_Gm06 was located in the pericentromeric region (Fig. 3). The other maturity gene E7 locus for flowering is located on the same chromosome and is genetically tightly linked to the E1 locus.71 Fine mapping would be needed to resolve these possibilities.Genes responsible for qDFF_Gm11, qDFF_Gm12 and qDFF_Gm13 (and nearby QTLs for other traits) have not been characterized. QTLs corresponding to qDFF_Gm12 have been identified in two different populations derived from crosses between wild and cultivated soybeans.72 Satt442 (the closest DNA marker in the above study) was located close to the marker s024200450 in the present study. Previous study73 reported QTLs at positions similar to that of qDFF_Gm11. They identified a strong QTL, named qDfm1 (Duration from flowering to maturity), using RILs derived from a cross between Fukuyutaka and Ippon-sango in a low-latitude region of Japan (Kyushu, 32°52'N). Although the positions of qDFF_Gm11 and qDfm1 are close to each other on the linkage map, the effect of qDfm1 was not associated with DFF.73 The difference might be related to population size (192 F2 or 999 BC3F2 plants vs. 143 RILs) and a short photoperiod at low latitudes. In any case, both QTLs control RP under different photoperiod and temperature conditions (in the middle and southern parts of Japan). If the same gene is responsible for these QTLs, the Peking allele, which shortens RP, would be useful in wide latitudinal range. The evaluation of genetic interactions between E genes and qDFF_Gm11 by crossing CSSLs having different qDFF alleles would be important for controlling maturity.3.8. Future characterization of useful traits in PekingPeking was first identified as material resistant to the soybean cyst nematode H. glycines.74 Peking was introduced into the USA from Beijing, China, in 1906 (previous accession number: PI17852B; current USDA accession number: PI548402). However, other USDA accessions named Peking differ from PI548402 by RFLP analysis11: PI297543 (introduced from Hungary in 1964), PI438496 and PI438497 (from the Russian Federation in 1979). The Peking accession used in the present study revealed an SSR genotype patterns very similar to those of PI548402, but quite different from the patterns of PI438496A, PI438496B, PI438496C, PI438497 and two pure lines, PI548205 and PI548359, derived from Peking in the USDA germplasm collection, and from the pattern of JP28432 in NARO Genebank (data not shown).DNA markers for the soybean cyst nematode resistance genes Rhg4 and Rhg1, based on functional SNPs in Peking, have been reported.64 Previous study75 isolated the Peking gene Rps1k, which promotes resistance to stem rot disease caused by Phytophthora sojae races 2 and 11.19 Peking has also been used in studies of interactions with nitrogen-fixing rhizobia (Rhizobium and Sinorhizobium species) owing to their host specificity and genetic control of symbiosis by a host gene.76 Peking carries rfg1, which controls effective nodulation of fast-growing rhizobia, and Rj4, which controls nodulation of slow-growing bradyrhizobia.77 The responsible genes were isolated for rfg178 and that for Rj4.79 Peking is also resistant to the reniform nematode Rotylenchulus reniformis.18Peking has a Rsv4 gene for resistance to soybean mosaic virus and DNA markers have been developed for this gene.12 A recessive gene, rpv2, for resistance to peanut mottle virus has been reported in Peking.13 Peking is resistant to many isolates of the frogeye leaf spot pathogen, Cercospora sojina,15 which is controlled by a single dominant gene, RcsPeking, mapped near the SSR marker Satt244, and another resistance gene, Rcs3.80 Peking is tolerant to Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea race 6, which cause bacterial blight disease,14 and to soybean dwarf disease,16 soybean stem canker17 and corn earworm.81 Its seed-flooding tolerance at the germination stage has been explained by the structural characteristics of its seeds20,21 and is controlled by four QTLs.82 The success rate of somatic embryogenesis from immature embryo cultures of Peking is reportedly high,83 and six QTLs associated with somatic embryogenesis have been identified.84 Susceptibility of Peking to tumor formation by Agrobacterium tumefaciens is controlled by several genes,85 but these genes have not been isolated. The evaluation of CSSLs for resistance to these diseases and to stress would help to identify and characterize the resistance genes.4. ConclusionWe developed a high-density linkage map and CSSLs carrying chromosomal segments from the Chinese soybean Peking in the background of the Japanese soybean Enrei. The map provides a detailed genetic framework within which to use molecular markers for breeding and to obtain a precise assembly of the genome sequence in the Japanese soybean genetic background. The marker order on the linkage map agreed well with the new genome assembly Wm82.a2.v1, but large differences were identified on Chrs. 05 and 11. These CSSLs are a unique resource that would be useful for evaluating minor QTLs as single genetic factors in a uniform genetic background. We demonstrated that many QTLs related to basic agronomic traits detected in the F2 and BC3F2 populations were reproducible in the CSSLs.Peking has many useful genes for resistance to diseases, pests and stress, but most of these genes have not yet been characterized. CSSLs developed in this study would be a good resource for us in developing new cultivars harboring resistance genes and for gene isolation by positional cloning. To increase the genetic diversity of soybean for breeding, finding and confirmation of QTLs associated with agronomic traits using a mapping population derived from these lines would be necessary.

IntroductionSatellite DNA (satDNA) is an abundant class of non-coding repetitive DNA in most eukaryotic genomes. SatDNAs constitute clustered arrays of tandemly repeated sequences often located in the gene-poor heterochromatin of centromeres and telomeres.1–4 SatDNA arrays are also dispersed in eu/heterochromatin of sex chromosomes as for example in the sorrel Rumex acetosa,5 the flatworm Schistosoma mansoni6 and the cricket Eneoptera surinamensis.7 SatDNA can also occur as single or short arrays nearby protein-coding genes within autosomal euchromatin.8–13 Clustered and dispersed organizational patterns of satDNA are achieved by multiple mechanisms of non-reciprocal transfer such as unequal crossing-over, intrastrand homologous recombination, gene conversion, rolling-circle replication and transposition.14–16 These genetic exchanges lead to homogenization of arrays over the time in a process called concerted evolution.14Even though most satDNA arrays are embedded in tightly condensed heterochromatin that is considered transcriptionally silent and inert, evidence for their transcription has been documented in insects, vertebrates and plants.3,17 It has been shown that satDNA could be processed into small RNAs, like siRNAs and piwiRNAs, which are involved, for example, in epigenetic process of heterochromatin formation in organisms as diverse as Schizosaccharomyces pombe, Drosophila, nematodes and plants.18–21 Recently, it has also been shown that the major satDNA TCAST1 plays a role in the modulation of protein-gene expression in the beetle Tribolium castaneum.12 Finally, satDNA arrays adopt specific folding structures, known as high order repeat structures (HORs), in which a block of multiple repeat units form large folding units that are tandemly repeated and attract nuclear proteins.22 This folding makes satellites potential carriers of a ‘chromatin code’ possibly contributing to cell identity and the specificity of chromosome territories.22In Orthoptera, satDNAs have been described in about 25 species, including several grasshoppers,7,23–28 but also the desert locust Schistocerca gregaria in which transcription patterns were investigated25 and the cave cricket genus Dolichopoda.29 For crickets, satDNAs were isolated in about 15 species7,23,24 and among Gryllus two distal satDNAs were isolated from the genome of G. bimaculatus30 with one of them (GBH535) observed in other two genus representatives, suggesting conservation. The genus Gryllus is composed of about 94 species (http://orthoptera.speciesfile.org/Common/basic/Taxa.aspx? TaxonNameID=1122353) that have been used as models for speciation, behavior and ecological, physiology, developmental biology, population genetics and evolutionary studies over several decades.31–47 With respect to chromosomal analysis, the genus presents highly conserved karyotypes with 2n = 29<U+2642>/30<U+2640> and X0<U+2642>/XX,30,48–51 although in some cases diploid number reduction and chromosomal polymorphisms have been reported.51,52 In a previous study, we characterized the chromosomes of G. assimilis to understand genome organization and evolution of some repetitive DNAs (e.g. 18 S and 5 S rDNA, U1 and U2 snDNA, histone H3 gene, microsatellites arrays and C0t- DNA fractions) and use this species as model for chromosomal and genomic analysis.53 The species presents the typical 2n = 29<U+2642>/30<U+2640> karyotype, an X0<U+2642>/XX<U+2640> sex-determining system, C-positive heterochromatin around centromeres and terminal regions that primarily did not reveal A + T or G + C base pair richness. C-positive regions were enriched with the C0t- DNA fraction. The chromosomal localization of 18 S rDNA, 5 S rDNA, U1 and U2 snDNA was shown to be conserved with the occurrence of a small number of clusters, in contrast to the dispersed localization and multiple clusters for histone H3 gene and several microsatellites arrays.53In the present study, we used DNA- and RNA-seq from a G. assimilis inbred line kept in our lab to address the content and transcriptional patterns of satDNAs in the species. Additionally, we mapped the RNA-seq libraries available at NCBI for other Gryllus (G. bimaculatus, G. rubens and G. firmus) against the satDNAs found in G. assimilis and G. bimaculatus30 genomes to investigate the conservation of satDNA and their transcriptional profiles in Gryllus. The data regarding satDNAs presence in the genome of G. assimilis were discussed in an evolutionary context, with transcriptional data enabling comparisons between the sexes and across tissues when possible. We hypothesize that the functionality of satDNAs in Gryllus might result from their role in sexual differentiation at the chromatin level, heterochromatin formation and centromeric function.2. Materials and methods2.1. Samples, chromosome obtaining and genomic DNA extractionMales and females of Gryllus assimilis were obtained from a pool of individuals that had been bred at the Univ. Estadual Paulista–UNESP (Rio Claro, SP, Brazil). Mitotic chromosomes preparations were obtained from embryo neuroblasts using standard procedures described elsewhere54 with slight modifications according to Palacios-Gimenez et al.53 Genomic DNA of adult males and females were extracted from femurs using the phenol/chloroform-based procedure described in Sambrook and Russel.552.2. Illumina sequencing and graph-based clustering of sequencing readsPaired-end sequencing (2x101) were performed in libraries constructed as recommended using Illumina TruSeq DNA PCR-Free kit (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) from female genomic DNA. The library fragment sequencing was performed by Macrogen service facility (Macrogen Inc., South Korea) using a HiSeq2000 system. Sequencing reads were preprocessed to check the quality of the reads with FASTQC56 and we did a quality filtering with the FASTX-Toolkit suit.57 The paired-end reads were joined using the ‘fastq-join’ software of the FASTX-Toolkit suit57 using default options. To search for satDNA in G. assimilis genome, we performed a graph-based clustering and assembly of these sequences using the standard RepeatExplorer pipeline.58,59 Subsequently, we examined those clusters that displayed repeat graph density in the RepeatExplorer summary output to identify satDNAs families.58 We refined the identification using dotplot graphics implemented in Dotlet60 to confirm their tandem organization. All clusters containing reads with sequences represented above 0.01% of genome proportion (high copy number sequences) were analysed in detail.2.3. Isolation and sequence analysis of satDNAsClusters with high graph density were analysed using Tandem Repeats Finder (TRF) algorithm61 to identify the DNA sequence that maximized the alignment scores between the different monomers that could be defined in tandem. All clusters have been processed with TRF using alignment parameters 2, 3, 5 for match, mismatch and indels, respectively, and a minimum alignment score of 50. Moreover, we used the dotplot graphic alignment tool implemented in Dotlet60 to identify the exact start and end of monomers of the same family and to confirm their tandem organization. The monomer with maximum length was used as the representative copy for each satDNA family, and also as the query sequences in further BLAST (http://www.ncbi.nlm.gov/Blast/) and Repbase (http://www.girinst.org/repbase/) searches to check similarity with published sequences. Also, these canonical monomers were BLASTed against the satDNAs of the cricket Eneoptera surinamensis7 and the grasshopers Ronderosia bergii,28,Locusta migratoria26 and Eumigus monticola.27 Sequence alignments of satDNAs copies were performed using Muscle62 implemented in MEGA5.63 MEGA5 was also used to estimate nucleotide divergence (p distance), A + T content and to perform repeat length analysis. Evolutionary relationships among sequences were inferred by neighbor-joining (NJ) trees using the proportion of nucleotide differences (p distance) in MEGA5. To predicted secondary structure of G. assimilis satDNAs we used CentroidFold software64 with McCaskill inference engine and 2^–5 weight for base pairs set parameters as options.The assembled consensus sequences of each satDNA family was used to design primers with opposite directions (Supplementary File S1), using the Primer3 software65 or manually. In order to verify the presence of satDNAs families, we performed polymerase chain reactions (PCR). PCRs were performed using 10× PCR Rxn Buffer, 0.2 mM MgCl2, 0.16 mM dNTPs, 2 mM of each primer, 1 U of Taq Platinum DNA Polymerase (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) and 50–100 ng/µl of template DNA. The PCR conditions included an initial denaturation at 94 °C for 5 min and 30 cycles at 94 °C (30 s), 55 °C (30 s) and 72 °C (80 s), plus a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min. The PCR products were visualized on a 1% agarose gel. The monomeric bands were isolated and purified using the Zymoclean™ Gel DNA Recovery Kit (Zymo Research Corp., The Epigenetics Company, USA) according to the manufacturer‘s recommendations and then used as source for reamplification for subsequent analysis.To check the isolation of sequences of interest, purified PCR products were Sanger sequenced in both directions using the service of Macrogen Inc., and then compared to consensus sequences obtained by genomic analysis. The monomer consensus sequences belonging to each of the satDNAs families were deposited in the NCBI database under the accession numbers MF991236-MF991248. In addition, the consensus sequences for each satDNAs family can be found in the Supplementary File S2 and sequence alignments are available upon request.2.4. Probes and fluorescence in situ hybridizationPCR products for each satDNA with more than 50 bp were labelled by nick translation using biotin-14-dATP (Invitrogen) or digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Roche, Mannheim, Germany). SatDNAs with less than 50 bp were labelled directly at the 5’ end with biotin-14 dATP (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) during their synthesis. Single- or two-colour fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed according to Pinkel et al.66 with modifications67 using mitotic chromosome preparations. The 18 S rDNA probe from Dichotomius geminatus67 was used to check the possible overlapping with satDNAs in the secondary constriction of pair 1. The probes labelled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP were detected using anti-digoxigenin-rhodamine (Roche) and the probes labelled with biotin-14-dATP were detected using streptavidin conjugated with Alexa Fluor 488 (Invitrogen).Following FISH, chromosomal preparations were counterstained using 4’, 6-diamidine-2’-phenylindole (DAPI) and mounted in VECTASHIELD (Vector, Burlingame, CA, USA). Chromosomes and hybridization signals were observed using an Olympus BX61 fluorescence microscope equipped with appropriate filter sets. Black-and-white images were recorded using a DP71 cooled digital camera. The images were pseudo-coloured in blue (chromosomes) and red or green (signals), merged and optimized for brightness and contrast using Adobe Photoshop CS2.2.5. Transcription of satDNAsWe used Illumina RNA-seq reads (2x126) from G. assimilis male and female heads, testis and ovary transcriptome projects that are in preparation in our lab (unpublished data) to investigate satDNA transcription in each tissue. For this species, three biological replicates for every tissue were used. For comparative proposes, we investigated whether the 13 satDNAs from G. assimilis identified here were transcribed across available tissues of G. bimaculatus, G. rubens and G. firmus RNA-seq data. We also used the GBH535 and GBH542 satDNAs families isolated from G. bimaculatus30 for the same approach. Consensus sequences for each satDNA from G. assimilis were used for analysis and for G. bimaculatus consensus for satDNA families were generated using clones deposited at NCBI with the follows access numbers: GBH535 family, AB204914-AB204938; GBH542 family, AB204939-AB204951.We downloaded from NCBI database RNA-seq data from three Gryllus species, as follows: mixed ovaries and embryos RNA-seq reads (accession SRX023832), mixed-stage embryos RNA-seq reads (accession SRX0238310) and ovaries RNA-seq reads (accession SRX023831) from G. bimaculatus; whole animal samples RNA-seq reads (accession SRX1596750, SRX1596749, SRX1596748, SRX1596747, SRX1596746, SRX1596745, SRX1596744, SRX1596743, SRX1596742, SRX1596741, SRX1596740, SRX1596739, SRX1596738, SRX1596737, SRX1596736, SRX1596735, SRX1596734, SRX1596733, SRX1596732, SRX1596731, SRX1596730, SRX1596729, SRX1596728, SRX1596727) from G. rubens; flight muscle from long winged female with histolyzed flight muscle (LWFHFM) samples RNA-seq reads (accession SRX272161, SRX272160, SRX272159), flight muscle from long winged female with functional flight muscle (LWFFM) samples RNA-seq reads (accession SRX272158, SRX272157, SRX272156, SRX272155), fat body from short winged female incapable of flight (FBSWFIF) samples RNA-seq reads (accession SRX272155, SRX272154, SRX272153, SRX272152, SRX272151, SRX272150, SRX272127, SRX272125), and fat body from long winged female with functional flight muscles (FBLWFFM) samples RNA-seq reads (accession SRX272124, SRX272122, SRX272120, SRX272119, SRX272117, SRX272111, SRX272106, SRX272104) from G. firmus.Raw RNA-seq reads from all tissue libraries were mapped to each of the satDNA sequences using Bowtie268 with the parameters–senstitive as options. For smaller repeats, as for example Gas1 (11 bp), Gas4 (73 bp), Gas9 (82 bp) and Gas11 (10 bp) the mapping was performed on dimers or several monomers were concatenated until reaching 200 bp length. The mapping results were converted from sorted into binary format using the SAMtools69 and the aligned reads were counted using the SAMtools options to compare between sequences and tissues in order to estimate their genome proportion (i.e. the expression value of the number of raw reads that align to a satDNA divided by the total number of raw reads in the sequencing library). The Bowtie2 output was used to estimate the relative abundances of these transcripts with Cufflinks.70 The quantification step includes raw read counts and scaled read counts. The scaling method applied was FPKM (fragments per kilo-base of transcript per million mapped reads, the expression value obtained after normalization of read counts by both transcript length and number of mapped reads in each RNA-seq library).3. Results3.1. SatDNAs identification and sequence characterizationIllumina DNA sequencing produced 37,297,670 paired-end reads with a total of 3,767,064,670 nucleotides (nt). The G + C content is 38.66% and the ratio of reads that have a phred quality score over 30 (Q30) is 91.3%. Given that the mean genome size of G. assimilis is 2.13 pg,53 this represents about 1.8x genome coverage. For clustering analysis through RepeatExplorer pipeline58,59 we used 4,035,746 Illumina paired-end reads as input. This subset was randomly selected for computational efficiency and returned 277,347 clusters (containing 37% of reads) that corresponded to the most abundant repetitive sequences in G. assimilis, including satDNAs and other non-characterized repetitive elements. The number of singletons sequences was 2,540,450 containing 63% of reads. To search for satDNAs, the top 224 most abundant clusters representing repetitive elements in the RepeatExplorer summary output with number of reads above 0.01% of genome proportion were analysed in detail. The abundance for each family was variable ranging from 0.014% to 1.35% of the genome (Table 1). Main features of the satDNAs isolated from G. assimilis genomeSE, standard deviation.Main features of the satDNAs isolated from G. assimilis genomeSE, standard deviation.Through dotplot analysis we confirmed the tandem organization of 13 satDNAs. These were grouped into 11 well-defined satDNA families, named Gas1, Gas2, Gas3, Gas4, Gas5, Gas6-1, Gas6-2, Gas7, Gas8-1, Gas8-2, Gas9, Gas10 and Gas11 according to decreasing abundance. Together, satDNAs comprised about 4% of the female genome, with sequences showing an A + T content ranging from 35.2% to 73.7%. Repetitive monomeric units ranged from 10 to 205 bp long with nucleotide divergence within the families varying from 2.8% to 30.5%. Most satDNAs found here constitute heavy satDNAs due to high A + T content (Table 1). To search for HORs, we recovered and counted the maximum number of tandem arrays per contigs for each satDNA family as possible, using dotplot analysis. Then, we counted the total number of monomers present in each the clusters (Table 1). These results mean that some satDNAs family, e.g. Gas1, Gas4, Gas7 and Gas11, are present in multiples distinct contigs, indicating the presence of distinct sequence subtypes and possibly containing sequences organized into HORs.For Gas6 satDNAs family we identified two subfamilies, named Gas6-1 and Gas6-2 (Table 1). The size of Gas6-1 is 199 bp while Gas6-2 is 200 bp. Nucleotide divergence between both Gas6-1 and Gas6-2 is 21.4%. Similarly, Gas8 displayed two subfamilies, named Gas8-1 and Gas8-2, with monomer unit ranging from 179 bp and 181 bp, respectively (Table 1). The nucleotide divergence between them is 12.8%. The results of different satDNAs subfamilies in G. assimilis genome is supported by NJ trees which showed Gas6-1, Gas6-2, Gas8-1 and Gas8-2 allocated in cluster-specific branches, indicating that each subfamily is composed of exclusive repeat-variants probably originating from a common ancestor (Supplementary File S3). The search for similarity with other previously described sequences in NCBI BLAST and Repbase for each satDNA showed that Gas9 (82 bp) has 93% of identity with Gryllus bimaculatus mRNA of 91 bp length (NCBI access number AK277574.1) and also that Gas10 (161 bp) has 87% of identity with G. bimaculatus mRNA of 109 bp length (NCBI access number AK272100.1). The remaining satDNAs did not reveal similarity with any other previously described sequences.3.2. Chromosomal localization of satDNAsIn most autosomes, satDNAs were located preferentially in pericentromeric regions, extending to the short arm that corresponds to the C-band positive blocks observed by Palacios-Gimenez et al.53 (Figs. 1 and 2). This pattern was observed for Gas1 (Fig. 1a), Gas4 (Fig. 1d), Gas7 (Fig. 1f), Gas8 (Fig. 2c and d), Gas9 (Fig. 1g), Gas10 (Fig. 1h), Gas11 (Fig. 1i). Besides pericentromeric signals some small autosomes revealed terminal labelling in both arms, varying from two to six chromosomes, which in some cases extended to pericentromere (Figs. 1a, 1d, 1e–I, 2c and 2d). Moreover, for Gas7 interstitial blocks were noticed, including the pair 1 (Fig. 1f). For Gas1, Gas4, Gas8-1, Gas9, Gas10 and Gas11 no signals were observed in the pair 1 (Figs. 1a, 1d, 1g–I and 2c). Concerning the other four satDNAs, distinct patterns were noticed as follow: Gas2, blocks restrict to pericentromeric region for all chromosomes (Fig. 1b); Gas3, interstitial signals in five pairs (Fig. 1c); Gas5, small terminal blocks in short arm of some chromosomes and occurrence of two small elements with signals in both ends (Fig. 1e); Gas6, the two subfamilies restrict to the secondary constriction of pair 1 (Fig. 2a and b) that also correspond to C-positive heterochromatic band and G + C positive blocks (<U+2060>CMA3+<U+2060>) and location of 18 S rDNA (Fig. 2a and b) and U2 snDNA observed by Palacios-Gimenez et al.53Chromosomal location of nine satDNAs in mitotic chromosomes of embryos of G. assimilis by FISH.

Asterisks indicate chromosomes with signals in both termini.For the X chromosome no signals were observed for Gas3 (Fig. 1c), Gas5 (Fig. 1e) and Gas6 (Fig. 2a and b). The other satDNAs occurred at one end of X chromosome (Figs. 1a, 1d, 1f–I, 2c and 2d), except for Gas2 that is pericentromeric (Fig. 1b). Additionally, for Gas8-2 one interstitial block was also noticed (Fig. 2d). The different chromosomal localization of Gas8-1 and Gas8-2 (Fig. 2c and d) highlights that the two subfamilies occupy separate genomic regions.3.3. Transcription of satDNAsTo explore the possibility of satDNA transcription we used RNA-seq data from four Gryllus species: Illumina paired-end reads from G. assimilis male heads (143,521,774 reads) and female (156,505,578 reads) heads, testis (133,834,504 reads) and ovary (135,002,056 reads); Illumina paired-end reads from G. rubens whole animal (792,280,896 reads); Illumina single line reads from G. firmus FBLWFFM (56,930,863), FBSWFIF (40,216,469), LWFFM (25,270,610), LWFHFM (18,443,958) and Titanium 454 GS FLX reads from G. bimaculatus mixed ovaries and embryos (1,542,093 reads) and mixed-stage embryos (9,867 reads) and ovaries (8,421 reads). Raw RNA-seq reads from all tissue libraries were mapped to each of the satDNA sequences. The quantification step includes raw read counts and scaled read counts. The scaling method applied was FPKM (fragments per kilo-base of transcript per million mapped reads). The mapping of transcriptomic libraries of G. assimilis, G. bimaculatus, G. firmus and G. rubens against the 13 G. assimilis satDNAs detected here and the two G. bimaculatus satDNAs (GBH535 and GBH542) published by Yoshimura et al.30 revealed the transcription of satDNAs in several species and tissues.We found evidence that seven satDNA families (Gas1, Gas3, Gas5, Gas6-1, Gas8-2, Gas11 and GBH535) were transcribed in at least one of the three species (G. assimilis, G. firmus and G. rubens). The degree of expression was variable depending on the repeat mapped, the species, tissue and sex (Fig. 3, Tables 2–4). We did not find evidence for satDNA transcription in G. bimaculatus even when we examined satDNA isolated from its own genome (i.e. GBH535 and GBH542) by Yoshimura et al.,30 suggesting either no transcription of satellites and absence of Gas repeats in this species when comparing with the congeneric species.

The repeat Gas1 is transcribed in G. assimilis, Gas11 is transcribed in fat body tissues (FBLWFFM and FBSWFIF) of G. firmus and Gas6-1 is transcribed in G. rubens (Fig. 3a–c). The repeat GBH535 is transcribed only in G. firmus and G. rubens, but, in the former species, this repeat was transcribed only in FBSWFIF (Fig. 3b and c). Three repeats, Gas3, Gas5 and Gas8-2 are transcribed in the three species, but Gas3 is not expressed in the G. assimilis ovary and Gas5 is absent in G. firmus LWFFM (Fig. 3a and b); Gas8-2 is transcribed in G. firmus FBLWFFM and FBSWFIF, while in G. assimilis it is observed only in testis, but in G. rubens this repeat is transcribed in the whole animal sample (Fig. 3a, b and c). Because the tissues used for transcriptional analysis were all different among the three species we could not assess the species-specific or tissue-specific transcription.3.4. Secondary structure predictionOf the 13 satDNAs identified in G. assimilis, 7 of them are able to adopt secondary structures with well-defined helices, i.e. Gas2, Gas4, Gas5, Gas6-1, Gas8-1, Gas8-2 and Gas10. The base pairing probability of the secondary structures showed that the abovementioned repeats are able to form short and long helices ranging from 2 bp to 7 bp in length (Supplementary File S4). Interestingly, both transcription and adoption of secondary structure were observed for the repeats Gas5, Gas6-1 and Gas8-2 (Table 2, Fig. 3, Supplementary File S4).4. Discussion4.1. Structural organization of satDNAs in G. assimilisGryllus species have been used as model in a variety of fields, from studies in behavioral ecology, to physiology and genetics. However, information concerning their genome organization and chromosomal aspects are poorly known. A more complete picture concerning chromosomal and genomic organization of distinct DNA classes are important issues that could help in future genomic studies. Our analysis revealed that repetitive DNAs represent a large portion of G. assimilis genome (about 40% from 2.13 pg of genome size). This high abundance of repeats could create gaps and other problems in future genome assembly project in this species, and putatively in other species of the genus should they have similarly high repeat content. These assembly gaps are expected to be particularly problematic in peri/centromeric chromosomal areas and in short arms of acrocentric chromosomes that as noticed through chromosomal mapping contain large arrays of satDNAs. A prior knowledge of the composition, localization and chromosomal distribution of repeated sequences, including satDNAs as reported here, is therefore needed.Among crickets, satDNAs have been studied in Dolichopoda species,24,29,71,Gryllus bimaculatus, G. rubens, Gryllus sp.30 and Eneoptera surinamensis.7 Although only in E. surinamensis the same strategy used here, that allow characterizing the satellites, was used.7 Comparative analysis from both satDNAs libraries, i.e. G. assimilis and E. surinamensis, revealed the absence of similarity between them. The satDNAs of G. assimilis were clustered primarily in heterochromatin, coincident with the C0t-DNA fraction.53 Moreover, the chromosomal distribution of G. assimilis satDNAs is similar to those A + T-rich GBH535 and GBH542 families described for G. bimaculatus,30 but it is distinct from the clustered, dispersed and intermingled pattern seen in the eu/heterochromatin of E. surinamensis.7 Considering the data from G. assimilis and G. bimaculatus three features regarding satDNA in this genus are worth highlighting: (i) the predominance of A + T-rich satDNAs families, (ii) the trends of these arrays to occupy more restrict chromosomal localization (i.e. constitutive heterochromatin), like in other Orhoptera, but distinct from E. surinamensis and (iii) also the possibility that the predominance of A + T-rich satDNAs could be a common feature in Gryllus genomes. This is in contrast with E. surinamensis, a species with highly rearranged karyotype,72 in which G + C-rich satDNAs predominates, with some of them scattered across multiple genomic locations.7Sequences organized as HORs in which a block of multiple basic repeat units are able to form a larger array unit and larger units are repeated tandemly as observed for Gas1, Gas4, Gas7 and Gas11 is known to be present in centromeres from primates,73 mouse74 and insects.23 The occurrence of such structures at the peri/centromeres levels, their sequence conservation (low nucleotide divergence) and wide evolutionary distribution suggests their involvement in structural and functional organization of centromeres17,75 with putative structural function for G. assimilis chromosomes.A few features of the chromosomal distribution of satDNA repeats in Gryllus are evident. Some satDNAs are located in multiple chromosomes, while other are located in fewer chromosomes (Gas3) or even exclusive in specific chromosomal elements (Gas6). This suggests differential dynamics for expansion and clusters dispersion of distinct repeats. Considering the observed satDNA distribution some explanations could be addressed. First, some satellites are coincident with C-positive heterochromatin (i.e. Gas1, Gas4, Gas7, Gas8, Gas9, Gas10 and Gas11), revealing the contribution of this class of repetitive DNA for the amount and complexity of heterochromatin in Gryllus. Second, the overlapping of Gas6-1 and Gas6-2 along with 18 S rDNA and U2 snDNA in the secondary constriction of pair,53 reveals the diverse constitution of this region. Third, the localization of Gas2 in all centromeres of G. assimilis suggests the possible involvement of this repeat for centromere function. Fourth, interstitial satDNAs placed in C-negative areas indicate the possible occurrence of heterochromatin, not revealed by C-banding, which has low complexity. Fifth, chromosomal distribution of satDNAs (i.e. Gas1, Gas4, Gas5, Gas9, Gas10 and Gas11) in both centromeric and telomeric regions of some acrocentric chromosomes suggests putative inversions involving repeats near centromeres leading to intrachromosomal dispersion of satDNAs. The putative inversions are reinforced by occurrence of karyotypes variable in morphology among Gryllus species.30,53 Finally, we noted that such differential chromosomal distribution of repeats is not strictly necessary for the emergence of new repetitive variants, as is evident when the subfamilies of Gas6 and Gas8 are compared. For example, Gas6-1 and Gas6-2 are restricted to the pair 1 suggesting common origin within the same chromosome. These repeats diverged by accumulation of mutations in each array followed by amplification and spreading involving well-known molecular mechanisms, like unequal crossing-over, intrastrand homologous recombination, gene conversion, rolling-circle replication and transposition.14–16 In contrast, Gas8-1 and Gas8-2 are placed and distributed on several different chromosomes suggesting the possibility of emergence of new repertoires from multiple chromosomes.As expected due to the euchromatic nature of the G. assimilis X chromosome—with heterochromatin restrict only to terminal regions—the satDNAs were placed primarily at the ends of this chromosome, and only Gas8-2 presented one interstitial block on the X. Low accumulation of satDNA in the X chromosome of G. bimaculatus was also noticed, with signals restrict to interstitial heterochromatin.30 These data contrast with the high accumulation of repeats in sex chromosomes of E. suinamensis, with a highly differentiated neo-X1X2Y.74.2. Transcription activity of satDNA in cricket species reveals wide evolutionary conservation of sequences and putative functionalitySatDNAs transcription has been detected in several organisms, with growing evidence pointing to the importance of this kind of non-coding sequence as global genome regulators.3,17,76 For instance, in chicken, zebrafish and in the newts Triturus cristaceus carnifex and Notophthalmus viridescens, satDNAs are transcribed throughout embryogenesis.17 In many insect species, satDNAs are also expressed throughout the development, and display expression differences between tissues and between sexes.3,17,25,76 Here, we found evidence that seven satDNAs which includes those isolated here from G. assimilis (i.e. Gas1, Gas3, Gas5, Gas6-1, Gas8-2, Gas11) and those isolated from G. bimaculatus (i.e. GBH535),30 are shared among crickets species but they are differentially transcribed in different body parts as well as between sexes. It means wide evolutionary conservation of satDNAs among cricket species after satDNA library divergence possibly as a consequence of its functionality.The seven transcribed satDNAs are presents as mRNAs polyadenylated, though we are not sure if such transcripts are exported to the cytoplasm or kept in the nucleus. Three repeats (Gas3, Gas5 and Gas8-2) are commonly transcribed in the genome of G. assimilis, G. firmus and G. rubens and considering the chromosomal localization of these repeats in the constitutive heterochromatin of G. assimilis, such transcripts can be important to heterochromatin formation. In this way, satDNA transcripts are processed into small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) participating in the heterochromatin formation and control of gene expression.17In other cases, we observed that Gas satDNAs show differential transcription for different tissues among species. The library sizes and construction protocol could account for these differences. Because of the tissues studied were all different among the three species we could not speculate about species-specific or tissue-specific transcription. The Gas1 was transcribed in testis and ovary and no transcription of this element is seen in male or female heads. For Gas8-2 it is highlighted differential transcription in gonads probably due to the highly specificity of the tissues studied. These findings suggest possible involvement of satDNAs (Gas1 and Gas8-2) during male and female meiosis or gonad maturation and function. However, further experimental evidences are needed to test this possibility. In other cases when the same tissues were compared, we observed that GBH535 is transcribed in the FBSWFIF but not in the FBLWFFM. Furthermore, Gas5 is transcribed in the LWFHFM but not in the LWFFM. This finding seems to indicate some relation between transcription of satDNAs and flying ability in G. firmus, although it deserves experimental validation. Bearing in mind the high diversity of satDNAs and their transcripts, several sequence-specific regulatory signals might reside within them acting as bar code allowing the cell to identify specific chromosome territories. For example, these signals can involve DNAs, RNAs or proteins as well as secondary or tertiary structures of RNA-mediated cathalysis, as noticed for example in cave cricket29 and beetle.12Through in silico analysis of G. assimilis satDNAs we found that seven of them are able to adopt secondary structures with well-defined stem-loops of double-stranded RNA stretches. Moreover, three of them showed to be transcribed adopting stem-loops of double-stranded RNA stretches. Such secondary structures that they adopt could determine RNA-protein interactions, suggesting functional roles. Transcripts of satDNAs able to adopt hummer-head like structures have also been detected, for example, in salamanders, schistosomes and Dolichopoda cave cricket species.3,17,29 It has been demonstrated that these hummer-head like structures can function as rybozymes with self-cleavage activities, though the physiological role of them is unclear and intriguing.17,29 In the light of such evidence, it is also possible that the folding helps to satDNA dispersion along the genome by rolling-circle replication mechanism, in which circular monomer result from secondary structure RNA processing into linear monomers and subsequently circularization by a host-specific RNA ligase.77,78Our finding prospects raise that the high repertoire of satDNAs and its transcripts might have relevance in organization and regulation of genomes, which will set the stage for further functional genome analyses in Gryllus. Bearing in mind the transcription of satellites it is plausible that the transcripts could be responsible for epigenetic chromatin modification as well as might have effect on the gene expression. Although further research in this area is needed, our structural and functional study provides an important step to understand the biology of satDNAs in Orthoptera, highlighting the importance of crickets as classical model organisms for evolutionary studies.The authors are grateful to Antonio Sergio Pascon for technical assistance in animal breeding.

IntroductionCultivated tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) belongs to the large Solanaceae family and, together with 12 wild species, is classified in the Solanum section Lycopersicon.1 Following the first introduction in Europe from South America in the XVI century, tomato has been the subject of continuous selection that resulted in reduced genetic diversity for this crop.2 As an effect of this process, regions of the cultivated tomato genomes are nearly fixed, causing linkage drag and hindering further breeding efforts.3 Nevertheless, thanks to mutations and introgressions from wild species, progress has been made for several traits, including fruit colour, shape, size and environment adaptation.4 Recent sequencing efforts contributed to promoting tomato as a model crop to understand the molecular and biochemical processes underlying climacteric fleshy fruit evolution.5,6 In addition, hundreds of genomes from landraces, cultivars, and wild relatives have been re-sequenced, laying the foundation to better exploit genome variation.3,7,8 Spain and Italy are considered secondary centres of tomato diversification.9–11In these countries, farmers’ selection and adaptation to local climates and low-input agricultural practices resulted in a plethora of landraces, differing in growth habit and fruit shape and size, and frequently carrying abiotic and biotic stress resistances as well as peculiar organoleptic characteristics and high nutritional quality.11–14 This biodiversity has been already used to undertake comparative genomics studies for the identification of fruit quality traits, stress tolerance mechanisms as well as fleshy fruit development and composition under harsh environments.15–17Increased shelf-life is among the most sought-after targets for tomato,18 though the molecular mechanisms and genetic determinants underlying this trait have not been fully elucidated yet. However, a large number of ripening-related mutants have been identified, including ripening-inhibitor (rin), non-ripening (nor), Never-ripe (Nr), Colorless non-ripening (Cnr) and Green-ripe (Gr), some of which represent a useful resource for extending tomato shelf-life.19,20 For instance, the rin mutation has been widely used by breeders, and nowadays hybrids (rin/Rin) constitute the basis for most slow ripening, long shelf-life (LSL), fresh market tomatoes. Landraces contributed with additional mutations to the identification of alleles associated to the LSL trait. Previous studies on Spanish tomatoes provided evidence that delayed fruit deterioration was associated with the presence of the alcobaça (alc) mutation in the coding sequence of the NOR gene.21–23 An additional mutant in NOR, delayed fruit deterioration (dfd), also causes attenuation of over-ripening processes, contributing to increased fruit shelf-life.24 Studying tomato fruit development, Zhong and collaborators25 demonstrated that epigenetic changes, such as variations in methylation profiles, are also involved in the ripening process and are associated with tomato shelf-life. The growing evidence connecting plant epigenomes to the interactions with the environment suggests that adaptation to local conditions may as well be accomplished by genotype specific changes in epi mark profiles.26,27In this paper, we describe the resequencing of the two tomato landraces Corbarino (COR) and Lucariello (LUC), the latter belonging to the Vesuviano type. They are traditionally grown in the Campania region (Southern Italy) and are highly prized by consumers for the superior quality of their fruits.28,29 They share some common traits, along with distinctive peculiarities (Fig. 1). COR produces obovoid fruits with an intense red colour and high levels of soluble and total solids,29 and LUC produces hearth-shaped fruit with a pronounced pointed apex of a less intense red and with a thick cuticle.30 Both are grown with very low water inputs that mostly rely on the infrequent rains of the spring-summer season in Southern Italy. These cultivation practices contribute to the distinctive trait of both landraces, which are the high fruit quality and extended shelf-life (Fig. 1). Fruits are traditionally stored in unrefrigerated, well-aerated, semi-shaded premises, thus the name ‘da serbo,’ i.e. preservable. Notably, LUC fruits are stored in bunches (named ‘piennoli’), which can be kept for 5–10 months. These peculiar features of COR and LUC offer a unique opportunity to identify, on a genome-wide scale, variants putatively associated with traits of great economic importance. Therefore, polymorphism identification was largely focused on classes of genes related to prolonged shelf-life, fruit quality and stress tolerance. Main morpho-physiological characteristics of the tested genotypes, Corbarino (COR) and Lucariello (LUC).

Materials and methods2.1. Plant material, DNA isolation and sequencingSeeds of the Italian landraces Corbarino (COR, selection Crovarese, catalogue n. TM326) and Lucariello (LUC) were kindly provided by Semiorto Sementi s.r.l., Lavorate di Sarno (Salerno, Italy) and Farm Casa Barone, Massa di Somma (Naples, Italy; http://www.casabarone.it (October 2017, date last accessed)), respectively. Seeds of Heinz 1706 (accession LA4345) were obtained from the Tomato Genetics Resource Center, USA. Plants of COR, LUC and Heinz 1706 were grown in greenhouse at the Institute of Biosciences and Bioresources (IBBR-CNR) in Portici (Italy). DNA was extracted from five plants per each accession. DNA was isolated using the DNeasy Plant Mini kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer’s recommendations. DNA quality and concentration were evaluated on agarose gel and using the Nanodrop spectrophotometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Wilmington, USA) and the Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Waltham, MA, USA). High quality DNA of COR and LUC was sequenced by Genomix4Life S.r.l. (Baronissi, Italy). Indexed libraries were prepared from 1 µg purified DNA with the TruSeq DNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Libraries were quantified using the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies) and pooled such that each index-tagged sample was present in equimolar amounts, with 2 nM final concentration. Pooled samples were subject to cluster generation and sequencing using a NextSeq 500 System (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) in a 2 × 150 paired-end format at a final concentration of 1.8 pmol. The DNA for InDel and SNP validation was freshly isolated from the same source plants according to the same reported protocol.2.2. Reference-guided assemblyRaw Illumina reads were processed with Trimmomatic (v. 0.33) to remove adapter/primer sequences and trim 5' and 3'-end bases (minimum quality 35, minimum length 35 bp). Quality of trimmed sequences was checked using FastQC (v0.11.3; http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ (October 2017, date last accessed)). Reference-guided assembly was performed using Reconstructor (v1.0) combined with the Heinz 1706 reference genome. A two-step strategy was used: iterative read mapping and de novo assembly of unmapped reads. In the first step, high-quality reads were aligned along the reference genome using SUPER-W (10.1093/molbev/msv152). Five iterations were performed in order to identify sequence variations such as SNPs, deletion and insertion polymorphisms (DIPs), and structural variations (SVs). At each iteration, only the variants with a genotype quality (GQ) higher than 30, with a coverage higher than 6× score and an allele frequency higher than 0.75 were kept. The identified polymorphisms were used to edit the tomato reference genome using VCF tools (v. 0.1.12 b, 10.1093/bioinformatics/btr330), thus obtaining cultivar specific sequences. The second step based on the de novo assembly of the reads that did not map on the reference genome was performed by using SOAPdenovo (v2.04, 10.1186/2047-217X-1-18) setting two k-mer sizes: 50 and 120 nt. Resulting contigs were filtered for size (> 400 bp) and subjected to BLASTN (v2.2.30+) search (e-value = 0.01) against the NCBI non-redundant nucleotide database section ‘Viridiplantae’ in order to remove possible contaminants. Using paired-read and split read approaches, Reconstructor was employed to combine the genotype-specific reconstructed genomes with de novo assembled contigs in order to obtain final private genome sequences. At least four paired-end reads covering the junction between the reference chromosomes and the de novo assembled contigs were required to generate new insertions. Low-complexity sequences, repetitive sequences and interspersed repeats within the reconstructed genomes were identified and classified using RepeatMasker (v4.0.5).31 The regions highlighted from the assemblies of COR and LUC as deletions or insertions were validated by bioinformatic and experimental approaches. For bioinformatic validation, the deleted regions in COR and LUC were localized in the Heinz 1706 genome (v. 2.50) and classified as belonging to repetitive, intergenic or genic regions. The hypothetical insertions in COR and LUC were re-checked versus the Heinz 1706 genome (v. 2.50) and the 2, 764 unassembled BAC sequences available at https://www.solgenomics.net/ (October 2017, date last accessed), using BLASTn. The Heinz 1706 regions matching the putative COR/LUC inserted regions were further analysed to check if they belong to repetitive, intergenic or genic regions. In this latter case, we selected the regions that presented mismatches between Heinz 1706 and COR/LUC in the coding sequence for further validation.For experimental validation, all the InDels and 12 randomly selected SNPs-containing genes found in COR and LUC were analysed through PCR and Sanger sequencing. Primer pairs (Supplementary Table S1) were designed on Heinz 1706 using the Primer3 software32 to amplify fragments from 0.2 to 0.9 kbp in length with optimum primer length of 23 bp and Tm of 62 °C. Amplification products were cycle-sequenced from both directions with a BigDye version 3.1 terminator kit and visualized on an ABI PRISM 3130 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA).2.3. Genome annotationBefore the annotation process, COR and LUC transcripts (including splicing isoforms) were assembled from custom RNA-seq data (papers in preparation). Reads from LUC fruits and COR leaves were subjected to normalization using Trinity (v2.0.6, 10.1038/nbt.1883). Then, normalized reads were aligned on the corresponding reconstructed genome sequences with STAR (v. 2.4.2a, 10.1093/bioinformatics/bts635). The resulting BAM files were filtered to remove duplicates with Picard MarkDuplicates (v. 1.31, http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/ (October 2017, date last accessed)) and then used as input for Trinity (v2.0.6) to perform genome-guided RNA-Seq assembly. In order to remove redundancy, transcripts were post-processed using the CD-HIT-EST (v4.6, 10.1093/bioinformatics/btl158) tool, which clusters similar transcripts based on a similarity threshold (99% of identity). Trinity assembled transcripts and the official ITAG2.4 gene models were merged and fed into the PASA genome annotation pipeline (v.2.0.2, 10.1093/nar/gkg770). The annotation was fully post-processed through different filtering steps in order to reduce false positive most likely due to assembly errors. Firstly, a transcript-level quantification was carried out using eXpress (v1.5.1, 10.1093/bioinformatics/btt034). Those splicing variants with an expression level < 15% compared to the most expressed isoform were removed due to their high probability of being assembly artifacts. In addition, single exon sequences overlapping multi-exon transcripts on the same strand were filtered out as they were also considered mis-assemblies. To classify the predicted transcripts, a lncRNA prediction analysis was carried out following the approach described in by Paytuví-Gallart and collaborators.33 Only the coding transcripts were further analysed using TransDecoder (v2.0.1, 10.1038/nprot.2013.084) in order to identify candidate coding regions (CDS) and untranslated regions (UTRs). CDS were functionally annotated using InterProScan (v. 5, 10.1093/bioinformatics/btu031). In addition, BLASTP (v2.2.30+) searches were performed against the Arabidopsis thaliana (TAIR10) protein complement. Only those hits with an e-value = 0.001 and a percentage match length > 20% were taken into account. In order to assess whether the COR and LUC loci could be mapped back to the Heinz genome, the gene body sequences were extracted with bedtools and then a BLASTn was performed against a database of Heinz 2.50 reference chromosomes and unplaced scaffolds obtained from the NCBI Nucleotide database (keywords: unplaced scaffolds SL2.50). Only the alignments with an e-value less than 0.01 and covering at least 75% of the gene length were kept.2.4. Public genome browserA genome browser was set-up to collect genomic sequences and their annotations as described by Kent and collaborators.34 The platform works as a web-based application running on the Net Framework 4.0. The embedded databases are organized in a relational model and implemented in MySQL (v. 5.6.14 InnoDB engine). All key fields and query dependent tuples were indexed using the BTree indexing algorithm.35 The genome browser includes the 12 pseudomolecules and the chromosome 0 (unplaced regions) of Heinz 1706 (v. 2.50), as well as the associated reference gene annotation (iTAG 2.4, downloaded from the SOLgenomics website), and the COR and LUC genomes. Gene annotations of COR, LUC, and Heinz, were included in species-specific partition in the Gbrowse database. A download data section allows sequences and data to be accessed upon request. Association of all the genes among the three genomes from each annotation (Heinz 1706, COR and LUC) was carried out by GenomeThreader36 using transcript to genome mapping of each landrace to the two alternative ones, with 95% and 85% of coverage and identity, respectively. This permitted to create crosslinks between each genome annotation to the corresponding similar loci in the other two genomes.2.5. Annotation and functional analysis of polymorphic regionsSNPs identified in COR and LUC during the iterative variant calling were functionally annotated respect to the ITAG2.40 genome annotation with SNPEff (http://dx.doi.org/10.4161/fly.19695 (October 2017, date last accessed)). Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis (GOEA) was performed on the genes showing missense mutations as well as on genes with polymorphisms altering CDS length (i.e. disruptive inframe deletions, disruptive in-frame insertions, frameshift variants, stop coding gain/loss and start codon loss). GOEA was performed with in-house scripts and was based on hypergeometric test comparing the proportion of genes in each GO category in the genome and in the groups of mutated genes; an FDR  < =0.05 was considered significant.3. Results and discussion3.1. Reference-guided assembly through ReconstructorTo develop genomic tools for molecular breeding and explore genetic variability for LSL and environmental adaptation traits, we performed genome resequencing of two LSL Italian tomato landraces, namely Corbarino (COR), and Lucariello (LUC). The Reconstructor pipeline (available at http://www.sequentiabiotech.com/omicstools/pipeline/ (October 2017, date last accessed)),37 which combines iterative variant calling and de novo assembly, was used to generate COR and LUC genome sequences. A similar approach is also implemented in the IMR-DENOM pipeline, which has been used for the genome reconstruction of 18 Arabidopsis accessions (Gan et al 2011). The final size of the reconstructed genomes of COR and LUC were 823, 643, 567 bp and 823, 719, 762 bp, respectively. Both genomes were slightly shorter than the tomato annotated Heinz 1706 reference (823, 944, 041 bp). The dataset used for reconstruction included 65.8 M and 56.4 M of 30–150 bp paired-end reads with an average insert size of 380 bp (± 52 bp) and 364 bp (± 49 bp) for COR and LUC, respectively. With the first iteration of variant calling, the average coverage was estimated to be 15.34X (± 81X) for COR and 13.42X (± 67X) for LUC. After five iterations, 189, 797 variants were identified in COR and 173, 764 in LUC (Table 1). On average, 95% of the variable sites could be already observed after the first iteration of the variant calling workflow (Supplementary Fig. S1). Conversely, the IMR-DENOM pipeline needed five iterations to reach convergence with Arabidopsis data,38 possibly due to the larger reads size of our re-sequencing effort (150 bp vs 32–52 bp of the IMR-DENOM dataset). The two landraces showed a similar ratio of SNPs, small deletions and insertions. In fact, 68.8% of SNPs, 8.9% of small deletions and 22.1% of insertions were observed in COR, whereas 69.9%, 8.6% and 21.3% of the polymorphic sites were SNPs, deletions and insertions in LUC. Twelve randomly selected SNPs and DIPs were experimentally validated. Sanger sequencing following PCR amplifications confirmed all the mutations, and thus the high quality of the reconstructed genomes. Since the position of SNPs and DIPs may influence the functionality of the encoded protein and is important for the developing of molecular markers, we evaluated the chromosomal distribution of genomic variants. In both landraces these variants were evenly distributed between the 12 chromosomes on a percent length basis. A slightly higher number of variants was found on Chr01, Chr04, Chr09 and Chr11, the latter mainly for LUC (Supplementary Fig. S2). It has been previously reported that Chr04, Chr09 and Chr11 in the Heinz 1706 reference genome display large introgressions from S. pimpinellifolium.5 Other resequencing studies on cultivated tomatoes found that these chromosomes carry a higher number of SNPs with respect to Heinz 1706.7,39 Higher SNP density reported for Chr09 in ‘San Marzano’ was associated to resistance loci.17Resequencing data from Corbarino (COR) and Lucariello (LUC) were used to perform an iterative variant calling analysis to identify polymorphisms with respect to the reference tomato genome Heinz 1706Here the number of high quality SNPs and DIPs across COR and LUC are showed.Resequencing data from Corbarino (COR) and Lucariello (LUC) were used to perform an iterative variant calling analysis to identify polymorphisms with respect to the reference tomato genome Heinz 1706Here the number of high quality SNPs and DIPs across COR and LUC are showed.3.2. Structural variantsThe fifth iteration of variant calling allowed the identification of 269 and 261 structural variants (SVs) in COR and LUC, respectively. In COR, 265 SVs were deletions and four were duplications, whereas 255 deletions and six duplications were identified in LUC. Other resequencing studies in tomato landraces and heirloom varieties evidenced, on average, a higher number of SVs.8,17 It should be pointed out that low genetic diversity is a common finding in cultivated tomatoes.40,41 However, despite the limited number of identified polymorphic variants, a clear discrimination of the two investigated landraces was possible.A high proportion of the deleted genomic regions (67.9% in COR and 67.8% in LUC) was characterized by the presence of stretches of unidentified nucleotides (Ns). They are usually introduced during the scaffolding process and were thus considered non informative (Table 2A). Regions including < 87% of Ns were classified on the basis of their genomic context (i.e. genic, intergenic and highly repetitive regions; Table 2A). Sequences with a N content that exceeded the 87% threshold could not be adequately processed by Blast similarity searches. The COR and/or LUC deletions occurring in genic regions concerned 14 Heinz 1706 gene loci (Supplementary Table S2A), that interrogation of the NextGenEx-Tom database42 indicated to be expressed in different tissues, including fruits. Therefore, the absence of these genes may have a functional relevance for the ‘da serbo’ phenotype of COR and LUC. Validation of the putative structural variants through reciprocal alignments of Corbarino (COR) and Lucariello (LUC) genomes to the assembled and unassembled (BAC sequences) Heinz 1706 reference genome and verification by PCRThe size range of the variants are indicated. A: % of unspecified nucleotides (Ns) and genomic context of the COR and LUC deletions. B: number of unconfirmed and confirmed insertions and genomic context of the scattered insertions.aVerified also by PCR.Validation of the putative structural variants through reciprocal alignments of Corbarino (COR) and Lucariello (LUC) genomes to the assembled and unassembled (BAC sequences) Heinz 1706 reference genome and verification by PCRThe size range of the variants are indicated. A: % of unspecified nucleotides (Ns) and genomic context of the COR and LUC deletions. B: number of unconfirmed and confirmed insertions and genomic context of the scattered insertions.aVerified also by PCR.By performing de novo assembly of unmapped reads, 29 and 36 novel contigs were identified in COR and LUC, respectively, and successfully placed within pseudo-chromosomes (Table 2B). To confirm that these putative novel genotype-specific genomic regions were absent in the tomato reference genome, they were aligned versus all the genomic sequences available for Heinz 1706, including the unassembled BAC sequences. As a result, five (two COR-specific, two LUC-specific and one common) sequences were found to be total length insertion (Table 2B) while six novel fragments from COR and five from LUC did not find matches in Heinz 1706 and were thus confirmed as inserted regions. Interestingly, most of these novel sequences displayed highly significant matches with Solanum pimpinellifolium (https://solgenomics.net (October 2017, date last accessed); Supplementary Table S2B). Moreover, among all Solanaceae species included in the NBCI database (March 6, 2017), all of them showed highly significant matches with S. pennellii (Supplementary Table S2B). Most of these matches corresponded to annotated gene loci in S. pennellii and could therefore be of significance for the characteristic phenotypes of COR and LUC. These findings suggest that the presence of a stretch of nucleotide base pairs into COR and LUC DNA sequences (i.e. full length insertions) may be the result of introgressions from these wild relatives followed by breeding efforts. Fragmented insertions, i.e. COR/LUC de novo regions only partially similar to Heinz, were identified for the remaining 20 and 28 sequences from COR and LUC, respectively, and were grouped in the three above-mentioned categories (Table 2B).3.3. Genome annotationRNA-seq data from COR (leaves; 164 M of 35–100 bp single reads) and LUC (fruits at red ripe stage; 421 M of 35–100 bp single reads) were firstly assembled in reference-guided mode, obtaining ~108, 000 transcripts in COR and ~94, 000 transcripts in LUC. Then, both sequence datasets were individually combined with transcripts derived from the iTAG annotation (version 2.40) and used to identify gene loci as well as derive transcript structural annotations within the reconstructed genomes. After removing redundant transcripts (i.e. duplicated and/or fragmented sequences), 43, 054 gene loci (corresponding to 46, 065 protein coding transcripts) were annotated in the COR genome, whereas 44, 579 genes (corresponding to 45, 815 protein coding transcripts) were detected in LUC (Table 3). These figures include about 10, 000 genes not annotated in the reference genome by iTAG and are similar to those reported for other Solanaceae such as Solanum tuberosum, S. pennellii and Solanum commersonii, which harbour 39, 028,43 44, 96644 and 37, 66245 genes, respectively. The higher number of annotated genes in COR and LUC respect to Heinz could be explained either by an actual higher gene content of the two landraces or by a lack of gene annotations in the reference genome. In order to confirm either hypothesis, the sequences of all the COR and LUC gene bodies were mapped on the Heinz genome and on Heinz unplaced scaffolds. All COR and LUC loci could be mapped back to the Heinz genome with a similarity higher than 90% and a coverage higher than 75%. The only exception was the LUC gene SolycLC11g018560, which shows a high similarity with a S. pennellii transcript with unknown function (LOC107005075), which could not be mapped. These results show that the iTAG2.40 annotation of the Heinz genome is still to be completed. By our hybrid liftover/de novo approach, new genes (i.e. either genotype-specific or missing in the official annotation) and novel splicing isoforms were identified. In addition, ~20, 000 gene models were refined and corrected. Moreover, RNA-seq data allowed to revise the structure of ~1, 000 mis-annotated gene loci. Most of the mis-annotated genes had small changes with respect to the reference genome. In most cases these changes affected the start and/or the end coordinates of the genes (Fig. 2). We also found evidences supporting gene merges (separated genes in Heinz 1706 were actually part of the same locus, see Supplementary Fig. S3). This occurred for 977 Heinz 1706 genes that were merged in 330 loci in COR and for 973 Heinz 1706 genes that were merged in 552 loci in LUC (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S3). Based on prediction analysis (Table 3), 26% and 29% of transcripts were classified as lncRNAs in COR and LUC, respectively. Notably, the recent release of version 3.1 of the tomato annotation by iTAG, occurred during the writing of this manuscript, also fixed some errors in gene models that were incorrectly fused or split. The exploitation of both leaf and fruit RNA-seq data, for COR and LUC, respectively, allowed robust discovery and annotation of alternative transcripts, providing an insight into the alternative splicing landscape in these two landraces. The official tomato genome annotation by iTAG did not deliberately provide an annotation of transcript variants; as a consequence, the ~60, 000 transcripts we annotated in COR and LUC using combined genome and transcriptome assembly RNA-seq data represent a valuable, publicly available, resource for studying tomato transcriptome plasticity for functional studies. The ratio of variants per gene, 1.44 in COR and 1.45 in LUC, is very similar to the 1.54 ratio observed in the latest A. thaliana genome annotation (Araport11),46 which was produced through a similar pipeline. A recent effort on tomato fruit transcriptome assembly identified more than 31, 000 splicing variants in about 11, 000 fruit-expressed genes,47 suggesting that alternative splicing may occur more frequently in fruits than in other tissues. It must be pointed out that the number of annotated genes and transcripts can vary significantly using different bioinformatic methods. For instance, by combining ab initio and genome-guided transcriptome assembly methods, about 33, 000 genes and 41, 000 transcripts were identified in A. thaliana Col-038versus ~27, 600 loci and 48, 000 transcripts described in Araport11. The remaining transcripts were translated into proteins, and Gene Ontology terms were assigned to 22, 198 transcripts both in COR and LUC.

Public genome browserA dedicated genome browser-based platform, accessible at http://cab.unina.it/genotom (October 2017, date last accessed), allows the genomic sequences of Heinz 1706, COR and LUC to be accessed and investigated. In particular, data can be queried by ‘gene ID’ and ‘keywords.’ The iTAG annotation (version 2.4) as well as the novel annotations from COR and LUC were reciprocally mapped on the three reference genomes. This allows to query using a specific gene ID and to receive information on where a locus similar to the one corresponding to that ID is detected on the alternative genomes. In Table 4, we report the number of transcripts per genome and the total corresponding number of hits found in the alternative genomes. Mapping of one genome transcripts versus the other genome considering multiple hitsMapping of one genome transcripts versus the other genome considering multiple hits3.5. Functional classification of the genomic variantsCOR and LUC genes showing sequence polymorphisms and whose structure was very similar to that of Heinz 1706 were analysed to get an interpretation of the effects of sequence changes. We focused on 30, 830 COR and 29, 935 LUC genes, respectively, corresponding to 86% and 88% of the genes annotated in iTAG 2.40. Interestingly, 3, 360 genes in COR and 2, 908 in LUC included more than one variation. In addition, approximately 2, 000 and 1, 700 SNPs with potential disruptive effects on 1371 COR and 1201 LUC genes were identified (Table 5 and Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Gene Ontology Enrichment Analysis (GOEA) was performed on genes harbouring missense mutations as well as on genes that included polymorphisms altering CDS length (i.e. disruptive in-frame deletions, disruptive in-frame insertions, frame-shift variants, stop coding gain/loss and start codon loss). No significant enrichment (FDR = 0.05) was found either in COR or in LUC. The most abundant GO categories are reported in Fig. 3. Genes carrying SNPs possibly associated with the peculiar LSL and stress-resistant phenotype of COR and LUC were further surveyed in detail. These include genes associated with fruit ripening and quality, epigenetic regulation of gene expression, and abiotic stress adaptation.

The barplot shows the mostly enriched GO categories (molecular function and biological process domains) of the genes affected by missense and non-sense mutations.3.6. Ripening-, shelf-life- and quality-related genesTwo hundred and four and 207 sequence variants were observed in 122 COR and 140 LUC genes putatively related to the process of fruit ripening, which also affects fruit shelf-life and quality (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). The two genotypes shared 136 missense variations in 83 genes. All these sequence changes were predicted to have moderate impact on protein function (Supplementary Table S3). In addition to common missense variations in six ethylene-responsive transcription factors (TFs) (e.g. Solyc05g050010, Solyc08g078170, Solyc10g076370), COR and LUC shared a splicing-site mutation in ERF13, a member of the ethylene-responsive transcription factor (ERF) family. This includes several TFs that trigger and orchestrate ripening. Their position in the regulatory network, however, is not fully understood.48 Some mutations affecting ethylene-related loci, previously identified also in ‘San Marzano’ and ‘Vesuviano’ landraces,17 included a 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate synthase (Solyc05g050010—T82A) and a transmembrane protein 222 (Solyc08g065320—V157L). This latter locus showed high identity with the tomato Green-ripe like1. Dominant mutations in this locus have been reported to induce a reduction in ethylene responsiveness in fruit tissues and may provide useful tools for breeding, although the impact of the identified mutation on protein function remains to be verified.49In LUC, a disruptive in-frame deletion of six nucleotides in exon 7 and an I5N polymorphism were identified in the coding sequence of the TAGL1 TF. TAGL1 is a key component of the regulatory network controlling ripening, being involved in cuticle development and fruit softening.50,51 The mutations identified in TAGL1 might putatively contribute to the LUC shelf- life phenotype.Common missense variations were found in several genes coding for cell wall degradation enzymes including polygalacturonases (Solyc12g019130, Solyc09g098270, Solyc02g067650), pectinacetylesterases (Solyc08g074950, Solyc08g075030) and rhamnogalacturonate lyases (e.g. Solyc04g014430, Solyc04g014450) that play a major role in fruit softening.52,53 This class of genes, together with ripening-related and polyamines genes, have been widely used for transgenic approaches to extend shelf life.54–57 Indeed, the first genetically engineered food brought to market was Flavr-savr® tomato, displaying decreased softening of ripe fruits due to reduced activity of a polygalacturonase.58 However, the expression modulation of some of the abovementioned genes has led so far to modest improvements in shelf-life.59,60 Nevertheless, the polymorphisms here identified might collectively have an impact on fruit preservation. In addition, LUC-specific missense variants were identified in the genes coding for an expansin (Solyc03g115310—E146G) and a fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein 13 (Solyc01g091530—S201Y), possibly involved in fruit texture and firmness.61 Notably, the same sequence variants were also identified by Ercolano and collaborators.17 In particular, the variant (E146G) observed in the expansin was the same found in the other LSL landrace ‘Vesuviano,’ whereas the one (S201Y) detected in the gene coding for the fasciclin-like arabinogalactan protein 13 was identified in both ‘Vesuviano’ and ‘San Marzano’ landraces.A missense variant was also found in COR and LUC in Solyc11g072030, which encodes for a non-specific lipid transfer protein (nsLTP). nsLTPs are well known as involved in the transfer of lipids through the extracellular matrix for the formation and deposition of the surface cuticle layer,62 which provides structural support and limits water loss, thus influencing fruit softening and storage longevity.24Fruit shelf-life can be extended also through alleviation of oxidative tissue damaging, which is the most likely cause of the delay in over-ripening and softening observed in purple and orange tomatoes.57 In COR and LUC, common missense mutations were identified in genes mapping to antioxidant pathways. Among these genes an aldo/keto reductase (Solyc09g097960) might control ascorbate synthesis and accumulation.63 Also, a LUC-specific missense variation in an ascorbate peroxidase gene (Solyc01g006310) may affect the cell redox state and level of hydrogen peroxide.64 Finally, polymorphisms were identified in genes involved in the biosynthesis and accumulation of phenolic compounds (Solyc09g007910, Solyc03g005090, Solyc10g009520) as well as in glutathione S-transferases genes that control their conjugation and compartmentalization.65 Besides missense variants, a COR-specific in-frame deletion K91del was found in a beta-glucosidase gene (Solyc01g081170) involved in the biosynthesis of the polyphenol coumarin (via 2-coumarate), whereas a COR-specific nonsense mutation (Y234*) was detected in a polyphenol oxidase gene (Solyc08g074640). These sequence variants might contribute to the fruit antioxidant activity of COR and LUC and to their LSL phenotype.Surprisingly, neither in COR nor in LUC we detected mutations in ripening and extended shelf-life associated TFs, such as ripening inhibitor (rin), non-ripening (nor), alcobaça (alç), or delayed fruit deterioration (dfd) (Conesa et al. 2014). This finding suggests that the COR and LUC long shelf-life has a different genetic basis compared to the Spanish LSL varieties ‘de penjar’ and ‘Tomàtiga de Ramellet’. In these varieties, the LSL phenotype was mostly associated to the presence of the alç mutation in NOR,22,23 a TF controlling the expression of several ripening-related genes and acting upstream of ethylene-dependent regulation of this process.66Besides extended shelf-life, COR and LUC fruits have other desirable traits, including high soluble solids content.29 Compared to the Heinz 1706 reference genome, COR and LUC showed missense variations in genes putatively involved in carbohydrate metabolism, transport and partitioning. For instance, the sucrose transporter SUT4, having a function in phloem loading, may control sugar translocation to sink tissues, enhancing the fruit soluble solids content.67,68Additional contribution to the fruit soluble solids content may come from shared mutations in the gene sequence of a 1, 4-alpha-glucan branching enzyme, involved in the immobilization of reducing sugars into starch.The plethora of sequence variations identified in COR and LUC in genes involved in ripening as well as in fruit storability and quality suggest that these traditional landraces could represent a pool of unique candidate genes never so far exploited in breeding for fruit LSL and improved quality.3.7. Epigenetic regulation of gene expressionGiven the crucial role of epigenetic control in fruit development and ripening,20 variations in epiregulator-encoding genes may also contribute to the peculiar traits of COR and LUC. Several SNPs within genes encoding for epiregulators involved in histone modifications and RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) were found. Overall, 26 genes were affected by 58 non-synonymous (57 missense and 1 nonsense) mutations which were in common between COR and LUC for twelve genes, while were COR- and LUC-specific for 8 and 6 genes, respectively (Supplementary Table S4). Approximately half of the mutations occurred in highly conserved portions of the proteins (data not shown). Common genes included SWI/SNF chromatin remodelling enzymes (Solyc08g077580, Solyc09g042480), a histone acetyltransferase of the HAG superfamily (Solyc08g068770), and histone demethylases (HDMs) of the Jumonji family (Solyc04g074490, Solyc08g081000, Solyc09g065690). The knowledge paucity about histone architecture in fruit genomes does not allow attributing significance to the identified SNPs relating to these loci. However, the evidence that Solyc04g074490 is preferentially expressed in fruit69 (https://bar.utoronto.ca/eplant/ (October 2017, date last accessed)) could be suggestive of a ripening function. Among common genes we also identified a SU(VAR)3-9-related histone methyltransferase (HMTs) (Solyc10g074370) showing 41% sequence similarity with the Arabidopsis SU(VAR)3-9 homolog 5 (SUVH5). This gene is required for CROMOMETHYLASE 3 dependent CHG methylation.70 It harbours a premature stop codon in COR, resulting in a 9-amino acid shorter protein product. Chen and collaborators71 reported that CMT3 affects the fruit DNA methylation status and the ripening phenotype in tomato. COR and LUC also shared polymorphisms in genes (Solyc01g012550 and Solyc06g051170) participating in the biogenesis of natural antisense siRNAs and in transitive silencing of transgene transcripts. Among genotype-specific variants, those affecting LUC were found in genes involved in small RNA-directed silencing mechanism, such as Argonaute slicer proteins (AGO1 and AGO10) and RNA-directed DNA methylation (RDM1). Similarly, a COR gene was found to code for a small RNA methyltransferase (HEN1) (Supplementary Table S4). RdDM is essential to maintain DNA methylation in CHH context and, strikingly, methylation at CHH is two times higher in fruit than in leaf, being enriched at promoter regions of the most highly expressed genes in the pericarp.25 Further studies are needed to understand whether the identified polymorphisms in RdDM-related genes could have effects on epigenetics-mediated fruit development, ripening and storability. COR-specific missense mutations were also identified in the DDB1- and CUL4-associated factor homolog 1 (DCAF1) gene (Solyc08g074370). In tomato, DDB1 affects the fruit DNA methylation status72 that is remarkably important for the developmental transition from unripe to ripe fruit.25 Equally interesting is a COR specific in frame disruptive duplication found in the ENHANCED DOWNY MILDEW 2 gene (EDM2, Solyc10g006090) whose Arabidopsis homolog regulates DNA methylation.73,74 The expression of this gene is preferential in fruit and increases during ripening (https://bar.utoronto.ca/eplant/ (October 2017, date last accessed)).3.8. Stress-related genesSince COR and LUC traditionally grow and produce in non-irrigated conditions, the genomic variations identified are expected to have functional importance on adaptation to low water input conditions. We identified 122 putative stress-related genes carrying at least one non-synonymous polymorphism in COR and/or LUC (Supplementary Table S4). Several SNPs were common to both landraces, e.g. those present in two Cation/H+ antiporters (Solyc03g032240, Solyc09g010530) and in several heat shock and heat shock-like proteins (e.g. Solyc05g055200, Solyc08g078720, Solyc09g011710). A stop gain variant shared between COR and LUC, leading to the formation of a truncated protein, is present in Solyc02g066890, encoding an AFP3-like Ninja-family protein. AFPs (ABI Five Binding Protein) were identified as a small family of uncharacterized proteins that may have a role in the attenuation of the stress signal through interaction with bZIPs responsible for ABA-dependent transcription.75 Similarly to Ninja, they also acted as co-repressors of Jasmonate responses.76COR-specific sequence variants included two amino acid substitutions (L878Q; V186I) found in a Tudor/nuclease-containing protein (Solyc03g118020), which is similar to the TSN1/TSN2 RNA binding proteins from Arabidopsis, essential for stress adaptation and RNA stability.77 An additional COR-specific polymorphism (C115W) affected Solyc00g154980, a putative ethylene insensitive class 3 transcription factor. The tryptophan found in COR is also present in several other Solanaceae, including S. pennellii and S. tuberosum. Moreover, Solyc12g094700, which codes for a Cathepsin B-like cysteine proteinase, shows a stop loss mutation in COR. Its Arabidopsis homolog is involved in tracheary element formation leading to functional water-transporting xylem vessels.78A putative heat stress transcription factor A3 (Solyc03g097120) showed a W469L substitution only in LUC. Few substitutions predicted to cause premature stop codons or disruptive in-frame deletions were also identified (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Two LUC-specific stop gain variants were predicted to have a high impact on protein function and affect a putative plasma membrane aquaporin (SlPIP2.10, Solyc09g007760) and a putative Homeobox leucine zipper protein (Solyc01g096320). The premature stop in this LUC transcription factor results in the genesis of a truncated protein of 71 aa in length compared to 239 aa in Heinz 1706. The closest orthologues of Solyc01g096320 in Arabidopsis (AtHB7 and HB12) have been associated to primary drought stress responses via ABA-dependent mechanisms.79,80 This LUC-specific stop gain mutation, together with the one identified in COR and LUC in Solyc02g066890, likely lead to a different or abolished activity of these proteins, resulting in a modified response to water deficit of the two landraces.Since fruit shelf life and water availability during the vegetative season were shown to be negatively correlated in ‘Tomàtiga de Ramellet’ tomatoes,23 it is possible that individual mutations may affect both traits. This could be the case for the splicing-site mutation in ERF13, since ethylene has a predominant role not only in fruit ripening but also in plant stress responses, and several ERFs are induced in response to stress.81In this work, we provided high quality genome sequences of two noteworthy long shelf-life tomato landraces, while contributing to quality improvement of the reference genome. A dedicated web-based platform allows browsing the distinct genomes, including information on the pseudomolecules representing Heinz 1706, COR and LUC chromosomes and their respective gene annotations. The possibility to query by ‘gene ID’ and ‘keywords’ to investigate genome tracks available in the platform offers an immediate access to integrated information from the three genomics resources. We believe that our findings highlight the wealth of diversity present in tomato landraces and may be of importance in exploiting DNA variation associated to traits of great economic importance. Future functional validation experiments and studies to examine the identified sequence polymorphisms in different landraces will shed new light on the genetics and molecular basis of fruit metabolism and storability in tomato, which is the model for climacteric fleshy fruits as well as on abiotic stress response mechanisms. Our data can be also employed to develop genetic markers and chip arrays for gene mapping and functional studies.4.

IntroductionPlants have evolved a multi-layered defense system to detect and counter pathogen infection. As a first layer, plants can perceive relatively conserved small molecules, proteins and protein fragments, produced externally to the cell by microbes or host cell degradation products, and collectively referred to as Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs). This recognition through plasma membrane pattern-recognition receptors (PRR) initiate a resistance response known as PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI).1 However, successful pathogens have developed proteins or small molecules termed effectors that can strike down PTI, resulting in Effector Triggered Susceptibility (ETS). As a second layer, plants have evolved the ability to recognize either directly or indirectly pathogen effectors using proteins encoded by resistance (R) genes. Genes encoding effectors that are recognized by R gene products, leading to effective plant resistance called Effector Triggered Immunity (ETI), are genetically defined as avirulence (Avr) genes. ETI drives a powerful immune response, epistatic to effector mediated immune suppression and sufficient to limit pathogen spread.2R genes have been implicated in resistance against diverse and taxonomically unrelated pathogens including bacteria, viruses, nematodes, insects, filamentous fungi and oomycetes. Strikingly, regardless of the plant or the pathogen considered and despite the diversity of pathogen Avr proteins, the majority of cloned R genes encode intracellular proteins with a conserved central Nucleotide-Binding domain (NB), also known as NB-ARC (Nucleotide-Binding adaptor shared by Apaf1, certain R genes and CED4) and a more variable C-terminal Leucine-Rich Repeat (LRR) domain.3–5 With regard to their N-termini, two phylogenetically distinct major groups can be distinguished within the NB-LRR or NL proteins.6 The first group contains an N-terminal domain with homology to the Drosophila Toll and human Interleukin-1 Receptor (TIR), referred to as TIR-NB-LRR or TNL. The second group, corresponding to non-TNL group is usually known as CNL (for CC-NB-LRR), since many members of this group are predicted to form a coiled-coil (CC) structure in the N-terminus. Despite an overall lack of sequence similarity, most of characterized CC domains possess a small ‘EDVID’ motif.7,8 However, a less abundant subclass of CC domain has been described in which EDVID motif is not present and which presents closest sequence similarity to RPW8, a non-NL R protein from Arabidopsis thaliana that confers broad-spectrum resistance against powdery mildew (Erysiphe spp.).9,10NL encoding R genes are present in all sequenced plant genomes in variable number, from less than 100 genes in papaya, cucumber, watermelon and melon11,12 to more than one thousand in apple.13 Variation in NL number is not necessarily proportional to the genome size and if NL-encoding genes often exhibit spectacular lineage-specific expansions, dramatic contractions have also been reported.14 This suggests that a limitation in the expansion of NL encoding gene number exists in a plant genome. This limitation possibly reflects fitness costs associated with resistance expression.15,16 Genome-wide investigation of NL gene family in various plant species reveal that NL encoding genes tend to be clustered in genomes. For instance, 66% of Arabidopsis thaliana NL genes, 76% of the rice NL genes, 73% of potato NL genes, 64% of cucumber NL genes, 81% of melon NL genes, 69% of watermelon NL genes, 81% of apple NL genes, and 70% of cassava NL genes are organized in clusters.12,13,17–20 These clusters vary in size and complexity and fall into two types based on the phylogenetic relationship of their NL sequences: homogeneous clusters containing phylogenetically related sequences that may have undergone frequent sequence exchanges and heterogeneous clusters containing phylogenetically distantly related NL and even both TNL and non-TNL encoding sequences.14 Coexistence of these two types of clusters suggests that different mechanisms are responsible of NL encoding genes evolution.Cytosine methylation is an epigenetic modification that affects chromatin packaging and transcription and has been shown to be involved in various biological processes including biotic stress responses.21 Whereas in animals, methylation at CG dinucleotides predominates, in plant, cytosine methylation occurs in three sequence contexts controlled by distinct pathways: the symmetric CG and CHG contexts, as well as the asymmetric CHH context (where H= A, C, or T).22 DNA methylation is established in all three contexts through RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway, whereby 24-nucleotide (nt) small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) guide the DNA methyltransferase to the corresponding genomic DNA.22–24 Whereas methylation in symmetric CG and CHG contexts can be maintained through DNA replication by context-specific DNA methyltransferases, maintenance of asymmetric CHH methylation requires either CMT2 (at long Transposable Element -TE-) or RdDM (at short TE or genes), depending on the loci that are targeted.22,25,26 Different Arabidopsis hypomethylated mutants defective in the RdDM pathway showed a modified response to disease after pathogen infection,27–29 providing evidence that this pathway modulates immune responses against pathogen. The pattern and the role of DNA methylation differ depending on the targeted genomic features. For instance, methylation of repetitive sequences, such as transposable elements (TEs), generally occurs in all three contexts and acts as a genomic immune system, by suppressing transcription and proliferation of invading DNA elements, thereby maintaining genome integrity.30,31 In contrast, cytosines within the transcribed-region of protein coding genes are typically methylated at CG sites, referred to as CG gene-body methylation. Although the function of gene-body methylation remains poorly understood, it seems to modulate gene expression and is generally positively correlated with moderate and/or constitutive expression.32–35Common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) is the most important grain legume for direct human consumption in the world.36 As a major source of dietary protein, minerals and certain vitamins, common bean plays a significant role in human nutrition particularly in developing countries.37 Several diseases caused by diverse pathogens including, fungi, bacteria and viruses, threaten common bean productivity. Many R genes effective against these diseases have been genetically described in common bean.38,39 The use of resistant genotypes is the most economic and ecologically safe management strategy.40 As observed in other plant species, these resistance specificities effective against various types of pathogens are often organized in large gene clusters that co-locate with NL cluster. However, the specificity of common bean genome is that these large clusters are often located at the ends (rather than in the center) of linkage groups (LG).38,39 Molecular analysis of BAC clone sequences corresponding to two of these R clusters, B4 and Co-2 clusters, located at the end of linkage groups B4 and B11, respectively, revealed that these two complex R clusters consist of a tandem array of more than 40 CNL sequences.41,42 Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed that these clusters are located in subtelomeric regions of chromosomes 4 and 11, in the vicinity to terminal knobs.41 Moreover, phylogenetic and comparative genomics analysis strongly suggest that the CNL present at the B4 R gene cluster derived from CNL of Co-2 R gene cluster, through an ectopic recombination event. A 528-bp satellite, named khipu, has been identified in B4 cluster closely intertwined to NL sequences.41,Khipu is specific to the Phaseolus genus, displays a subtelomeric distribution in 17 out of 22 chromosome ends and is a component of the terminal knobs.41 Recently, the study of khipu sequences at the scale of the common bean genome reveals the existence of frequent sequence exchanges between non-homologous chromosomes in subtelomeric regions suggesting that the case reported for B4 and Co-2 clusters is not isolated.43The genome sequence of common bean, G19833 Andean landrace, has recently been assembled.44 Among the 27, 197 annotated protein coding genes, 376 NL genes were predicted. Moreover, recently, a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation using MethylC-seq has been performed in P. vulgaris G19833 genome.45 CG-gene body methylation, which is found both in plants and animals, and hypermethylation of TEs in all the three sequence contexts were observed in P. vulgaris. Significantly, the satellite repeats khipu were found highly methylated throughout the genome. However, the detailed analysis of the methylation pattern of the NL genes has not yet been investigated.In this study, we present the classification of NL encoding gene family in common bean, their phylogenetic and positional relationships, and their physical organization as well as khipu satellite locations on the 11 chromosomes of P. vulgaris. As NL encoding genes are often present in close proximity to the methylated khipu repeated sequence, we investigated the methylation status of NL encoding genes using the MethylC-seq data that were previously published,45 as well as the 24-nt small RNA targeting and the expression level of NL. Our results provide significant insight into the evolution of NL and suggest a new regulation mechanism of NL transcription that has not been described in other plant species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Common bean genome resources and NL and khipu sequence datasetsThis study was performed using the whole v 1.0 genome sequence of G19833 genotype downloaded from Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net/). The complete set of common bean NL sequences used in this study was the initial set of 376 NL sequences annotated in common bean genome in Schmutz et al.,44 plus one additional NL gene identified after manual inspection and named Phvul.004G015950 (Supplementary Table S1). Among these 377 NL, 364 were on pseudomolecules and 13 on scaffolds. The khipu dataset used in this study is composed of 2,766 khipu sequences annotated in Richard et al.432.2. Phylogenetic analysis of NL encoding genesNL genes were subdivided into two subsets, TNL (106 sequences) and non-TNL (271 sequences) subsets and distinct phylogenetic analyzes were performed for each subset. The region spanning from the P-loop to the MHD conserved protein motifs was used to construct the phylogenetic trees. Nucleic sequences were initially aligned using ClustalW with default parameters46 and then optimized by manual editing using Seaview47 (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). Twenty non-TNL sequences, lacking a P-loop or MHD domains or presenting a highly divergent sequence were discarded from the alignment (Supplementary Table S1). We then checked for evidence of recombination among NL using a suite of programs implemented in RDP version 4,48 using parameters described in the literaute.49 Sequences showing significant evidence of recombination were eliminated from further analysis (Supplementary Table S1). Submitting the full alignments to Modelgenerator50 allowed to identify GTR + I+G and GTR + G models as the bests phylogenetic models to use for TNL and non-TNL, respectively. Maximum-likelihood trees were generated with PhyML.51 Bootstrap values were computed with the consensus of 1,000 trees generated with PhyML from alignments obtained with PHYLIP's seqboot program.52 The resulting phylogenetic trees were displayed using MEGA version 5.532.3. Methylation analysis of NL encoding genesNL methylation analysis was performed on the methylome data of G19833 leaves developed by Kim et al.45 For each gene, analyses were performed on the genomic region delimited by the coordinates presented in Supplementary Table S2. For genes not supported by RNA sequencing data (RNAseq), it corresponds to the region from Start to Stop, including introns, while for genes supported by RNAseq data, upstream and downstream untranslated region (UTR) were also included.44 Weighted methylation levels54 of the 364 NL, 498 PPR and 116 Homeobox genes present in Phaseolus vulgaris G19833 pseudomolecules were calculated for CG, CHG and CHH sequence contexts, where H refers to A, C and T. For each gene and cytosine context, probability (one-tailed P-value) for the methylation difference from genome-wide average was calculated using the binomial distribution as described by Takuno and Gaut.55 Genes were classified into three categories based on the P-value: C methylated gene (PCHG < 0.05 or PCHH < 0.05), CG methylated gene (PCG < 0.05 and not C methylated gene), unmethylated gene (PCG > 0.95 and not C methylated gene). Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) was used to visualize methylome data on G19833 genome.562.4. Small RNA library construction, sequencing and analysisRNA samples enriched for small fractions of G19833 young leaves were obtained with miRNeasy Mini Kit (#217004, QIAGEN®) and checked for their integrity on RNANano chip, using Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Waldbroon, Germany). Small RNA-seq library was performed according to NEBNext® Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina instructions (#E7300S, New England Biolabs, Inc.). Small RNA-seq libraries were checked for their quality on DNA1000 chip using Agilent 2100 bioanalyzer (Waldbroon, Germany) before Illumina sequencing (Illumina® California, U.S.A.). The SmallRNA-seq samples have been sequenced in Single-End (SE) with a read length of 100 bases on one lane of Hiseq2000 machine to obtained around 25 million reads. After adaptor trimming and t- and r-RNA removing, using Cutadapt57 and SortMeRNA,58 respectively, small RNAs of 24-nt length were selected using Prinseq v0.20.4.59 Redundant and non-redundant (NR) data sets of 24-nt sRNAs were then mapped on G19833 genome sequence including khipu, NL, PPR and homeobox gene family genomic sequences using Bowtie2 (v2.2.6) with ‘-l 24’ and ‘-n 0’ parameters60 and mapped reads were counted on each locus (as described for DNA methylation) and expressed in RPKM. A threshold of RPKM >5 in both redundant and non-redundant data sets was used to consider a sequence as mapped by small 24-nt RNA.2.5. Analysis of NB-LRR genes expressionThe publicly available leaves RNA-seq data of common bean G19833 was used to analyze the expression level of NL genes.44 FPKM (Fragments per kilobase of exon model per million fragments mapped) values corresponding to NL genes were extracted from Phytozome to perform a semi-quantitative categorization. Based on the FPKM scale defined in Hansey et al.61 expressed genes were divided into three classes: genes with a FPKM value below 5 are low expressed, genes with a FPKM value greater or equal to 5 and less than or equal to 200 are medium expressed, and genes with a FPKM value greater than 200 are highly expressed.3. Results3.1. Genome-wide annotation of NL in G19833The present analysis was carried out on 377 NL genes identified in Schmutz et al.,44 including 364 NL genes located on the eleven pseudomolecules and 13 NL genes located on unanchored scaffolds. In brief, common bean NB-encoding genes were identified based on HMM search of the predicted protein sequences of P. vulgaris (G19833; JGI, version 1.0) to identify sequences containing NB-ARC domain, completed by a tBLASTn of the NB-encoding sequences identified in the first step, on the entire genome of G19833.44 HMM search led to the identification of 398 predicted proteins corresponding to 342 annotated genes and tBLAStn procedure identified 35 additional NL genes. On these 35 additional NL genes, 20 were missing in the JGI annotation and consequently a new identifier was created (the last digits are 50). After manual inspection of the 377 NB-encoding R genes candidates 268 are predicted as full length genes and 109 as pseudogenes (i.e. genes with a frameshift or a stop codon before the beginning of LRR domain) (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). Number and classification of predicted NB-encoding R genes in Phaseolus vulgaris genomeNumber and classification of predicted NB-encoding R genes in Phaseolus vulgaris genomeAnalysis of each NL candidate allowed us to classify them into TNL or non-TNL families (Table 1). From the complete set of 377 NL identified in common bean genome, 106 proteins belong to the TNL group including 82 full length and 24 pseudo TNL genes. The 82 full length genes were distributed as follows: 73 TNL, 8 TN, and one TNT gene (Phvul.008G195300). The remaining 271 NB-encoding genes were collectively grouped into the non-TNL type and were distributed as follows: 103 genes encode CNL, including 85 full length and 18 pseudo genes, four genes encode CN, including three full length and one pseudo genes, 150 genes encode NL, including 86 full length and 64 pseudo genes, and finally seven genes encode NB including five full length and two pseudo genes (Table 1). In addition, within the non-TNL type, seven genes have been identified to possess a variant of the CC domain, the CCRPW8 domain which share close sequence similarity with RPW8, a non-NL R protein from Arabidopsis thaliana conferring broad-spectrum resistance against powdery mildew (Erysiphe spp.).10 Overall more than two-third of the predicted NL-encoding genes are non-TNL genes and less than one third TNL genes.3.2. NL physical organizationPhysical map positions on the eleven pseudomolecules of G19833 genome were established for 364 (96.5%) of the annotated NL genes (Fig. 1). Both TNL and non-TNL are present on each pseudomolecule, in variable amounts. It is clear that the distribution of NL genes is not random among the chromosomes and that they tend to be organized in clusters. To identify NL clusters, we used a previous definition which specify that NL are grouped in clusters when they are not interrupted by more than eight non-NL genes.18 Using this criterion, we identified 43 clusters, containing 294 genes in total, on common bean pseudomolecules (Supplementary Table S1). Thus, on G19833 pseudomolecules, 80.8% of predicted NL encoding genes are organized in clusters while the remaining 19.2% (70 genes) are singleton genes. The size of the clusters varied across the genome from 2 to 40 NL. Remarkably, NL clusters in common bean tend to be at the end of chromosomes rather than in the center (Fig. 1). Particularly, three ‘super’ clusters of NL, consisting of several clusters, were located at the end of Pv04S (Pseudomolecule 4, short arm), Pv10S and Pv11L (Pseudomolecule 11, long arm) (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S1). The super cluster on Pv10S mainly consists of TNL sequences, while the two super clusters on Pv04S (41 NL) and Pv11L (71 NL) comprise mainly non-TNL sequences and correspond to the previously identified resistance cluster ‘B4’ and ‘Co-2’, respectively.39,41,62–64Chromosomal distribution of common bean NL encoding genes and khipu satellites. The relative map position of 364 NL encoding genes is shown on the individual pseudomolecules depicting the chromosomes Pv01 to Pv11 as identified in the literature.44 Each NL gene has a unique label representing the seven last informative digits from the annotation. For example, G132300 located on pseudomolecule one corresponds to the gene Phvul.001G132300. Genes encoded by the positive and negative DNA strands are depicted on the right and left sides of the chromosome, respectively. TNL sequences are presented in pink font and CNL sequences are presented in black or white font. Colours and background of the genes are identical to the phylogenetic trees (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S3). NLs corresponding to pseudogenes are denoted by an asterisk (*) after their name. Centromeric positions on individual pseudomolecules were identified using centromere satellite repeats identified in the literarure103 and are represented by dark blue bars on the pseudomolecules. The arm above centromeric region is designated as ‘short’ arm while the arm below is designated as the ‘long’ arm. Khipu satellite sequences are indicated with red bars on pseudomolecule structures according to Richard et al.,43 with block sizes proportional to number of khipu units. CG methylated genes and genes methylated in the three contexts are depicted by grey and black arrowheads, respectively.Chromosomal distribution of common bean NL encoding genes and khipu satellites.

CG methylated genes and genes methylated in the three contexts are depicted by grey and black arrowheads, respectively.3.3. NL phylogenetical and physical relationshipsTo study the evolutionary relationships among the predicted NL genes, two phylogenetic trees were estimated from the nucleic alignment of NB-ARC domains of non-TNL and TNL genes. The resulting two phylogenetic trees are composed of 243 and 100 non-TNL and TNL sequences, respectively (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S3). Non-TNL and TNL phylogenetic trees can be divided into nine and four major clades, respectively (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S3). In both trees, these clades are composed of NL sequences coming from different physical locations (Figs 1 and 2 and Supplementary Fig. S3). For example, the clade CNL-H is composed of 80 NL sequences that map, to two different chromosome ends Pv04S or the end of Pv11L and corresponding to resistance clusters B4 and Co-2, respectively. Consequently, the CNL present at the B4 cluster (B4-CNL) are more similar to the Co-2-CNL than to any other CNL in the bean genome. More heterogeneous clades are also observed. Clade CNL-C is one such example as it is composed of 16 NL sequences from seven different chromosome arms (Pv02S, Pv05S, Pv06L, Pv08S, Pv09L and Pv011S) (Figs 1 and 2). As expected the seven predicted CCRPW8-NL were gathered within the same clade (CNL-R). However, CCRPW8-NL reside on four different locations, end of Pv01S, end of Pv02S, Pv03L and Pv06L. The same observation holds true for many different CNL and TNL clades where phylogenetically close NL sequences can be spread on different chromosome arms, suggesting sequence exchange between non-homologous chromosomes. On the other hand, both non-TNL and TNL phylogenetic trees show that most subclades are composed of NL sequences from the same chromosome arm (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S3). For example, CNL-A clade is mostly composed of three subclades of NL from Pv03S, Pv08L and Pv08S, CNL-D clade is composed of two subclades of NL from Pv01L and Pv07L, CNL-E clade contains a huge subclade of Pv02L NL and TNL-A contains a subclade of Pv04L NL. If the previous examples clearly illustrate local duplication of NL sequences, clades CNL-G, CNL-H and TNL-D are even more striking (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S3). These impressive NL amplifications are clearly visible on the physical map, where blocks of NL sequences of the same colors are depicted (pink blocks at Pv04S and Pv11L, light blue block at Pv10S, and dark blue block at Pv11L, Fig. 1). In conclusion, phylogenic and positional relationships of common bean NL suggest both frequent sequence exchanges between non-homologous chromosomes and local amplification probably resulting from unequal crossing-over. Maximum Likelihood Phylogenetic analysis of the predicted P. vulgaris non-TNL genes. Each gene is labeled with its Phytozome identifiant without the ‘Phvul.’ prefix. One color was assigned to each chromosome arm named by a number (from 1 to 11), corresponding to the pseudomolecule number, followed by the letter L (long arm) or S (short arm) and consequently each branch in the tree is colored according to the location of the gene carried by this branch. Pseudogenes are indicated by an asterisk (*) in the beginning or at the end of their name. CG methylated genes and genes methylated in the three contexts are depicted by grey and black arrowheads, respectively.Maximum Likelihood Phylogenetic analysis of the predicted P. vulgaris non-TNL genes.

NL colocalisation with the subtelomeric satellite DNA khipuKhipu sequences annotated in Richard et al.,43 are depicted in red on the physical map of G19833 (Fig. 1). As previously shown, khipu sequences are present on all pseudomolecule ends except on Pv06S and Pv09S (Fig. 1). Khipu units are often in close proximity to NL sequences as noticeable at the end of Pv01S, Pv02S, Pv03S, Pv04S, Pv04L, Pv05S, Pv08L, Pv10S, Pv10L and Pv11L. Strikingly, there are a lot of khipu sequences in the three largest NL super clusters, on Pv04S, Pv10S and Pv11L (Fig. 1). However, several NL clusters do not co-locate with khipu blocks, such as NL clusters on chromosome 8 or 2 (Fig. 1).3.5. NL DNA methylationDue to their proximity to repeated and methylated khipu satellite sequences45 and, at least for B4 and Co-2 CNLs, to their proximity to terminal knobs,41 we decided to investigate the DNA methylation status of NL genes. Indeed, various examples of methylation spreading from repeated sequence to the neighboring genes have been described.65–67 DNA methylation analysis reveals that out of the 364 NL encoding genes present on the pseudomolecules, two (0.6%) are methylated in CG context, 197 (54.1%) are C-methylated genes (i.e. methylated in CHG and CHH contexts), and the remaining 165 genes (45.3%) are unmethylated (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S1). Among the 104 TNL sequences, 31% are methylated while 64% of the 260 non-TNL sequences are methylated (Supplementary Fig. S4). Approximately, half of the full-length NL are methylated while almost 70% of the pseudogenes are methylated (Supplementary Fig. S4). This methylation mostly occurs on gene body (Fig. 4). Nearly all the C-methylated NL (89%) were also CG methylated (Supplementary Tables S1 and S3). Consequently, in common bean, ~half of NL sequences are methylated in the three sequence contexts (CG, CHH, CHG), a pattern classically observed for repeated sequences. Manual inspection of each methylated NL genes revealed that out of 197 methylated NL, 34 correspond to NL methylated only in intron with most of these introns containing repeated sequences such as transposable elements (Supplementary Fig. S5). However, the remaining 163 C-methylated NL are methylated on their coding sequence with methylated area ranging from the complete ORF to half of the ORF (Supplementary Figs S5–S7). Inspection of nearby genes of NL genes revealed that they do not present this atypical DNA methylation profile even if located in the same genomic environment (Supplementary Fig. S7). In order to see if this high proportion of methylated genes within NL gene family is specific to this family or a common feature of gene families (that can be considered as a kind of repeated sequences), we looked at methylation pattern of two other gene families. We examined the methylation status of the 498 genes encoding PPR (pentatricopeptide repeat) protein family and the 116 genes encoding Homeobox transcription factor family in common bean genome. Three and two genes in the PPR and Homeobox family, respectively, present an intermediate level of CG methylation and were thus excluded from the following analysis. For the PPR and Homeobox gene family, only 13.6% (7.7% CG body and 5.9% C-methylated) and 13.3% (5.3% in CG body and 7% C-methylated) of the genes are methylated, respectively (Figs 3 and 4, Supplementary Table S2). Consequently, there is a much higher proportion of C-methylated genes in the NL family specifically. Moreover, NL genes present higher levels of DNA methylation when compared with Homeobox and PPR genes, whatever the sequence context (% CG: 53.43 versus 29.27 and 38.17, Wilcoxon test, all P > 0.05; % CHG: 39.44 versus 3.47 and 10.97, Wilcoxon test, all P > 0.05; %CHH: 2.72 versus 1.17 and 1.02, Wilcoxon test, all P > 0.05, for NL genes compared to Homeobox and PPR genes, respectively) (Table 2). In particular, level of CHG methylation is much higher for NL genes compared to other genes (‘all genes’, PPR and homeobox genes), although lower than what is observed for TEs (Fig. 4). In conclusion, compared to other gene families, NL gene family presents both a higher proportion of methylated genes and a higher methylation level.

Among the 116 studied Homeobox Transcription Factor genes, two were found CG-methylated with an intermediate value and were then excluded from this analysis. For the NL genes, the analysis was performed in the 364 NL genes mapped on the G19833 pseudomolecules.Distribution of the methylated status of the PPR, Homeobox and NL genes in P. vulgaris.aTotal genes analysis was described in Kim et al.45 and correspond to the 27,082 genes annotated in G19833 genome.

Concerning the three largest distal NL super clusters, contrasting patterns of methylation were observed since most NL sequences from the clusters on Pv04S (B4 cluster) and Pv11L (Co-2 cluster) are methylated, while few NL sequences of the cluster located on Pv10S are methylated (Figs 1 and 2 and Supplementary Fig. S3). The majority of methylated NL genes from Pv04S and Pv11L clusters belong to CNL-H clade (pink, Figs 1 and 2). Pv11L cluster is also composed of sequences located in clade CNL-G (dark blue, Figs 1 and 2) that are also methylated. Interestingly, this latter clade is also composed of the scarce methylated sequences present on the globally unmethylated Pv10S cluster. This suggests that methylation of NL encoding genes could be influenced by their sequence, as closely related sequences (e.g. belonging to the same clade) share the same methylation status. However, within the clade CNL-D (yellow, Figs 1 and 2), NL sequences located at the end of Pv07L are mostly methylated in contrast to NL sequences located on Pv01L (Figs 1 and 2). This is also the case for the clade CNL-A (green, Figs 1 and 2) where all the sequences of the end of Pv03S are methylated whereas only half of the NL of the end of Pv08L are methylated and only one sequence is methylated in the cluster of Pv08S. Interestingly, the methylated NL sequences of CNL-A clade that reside in Pv03S are organized in a cluster (cluster 03 A, Supplementary Table S1) tightly linked to khipu sequences, as the three methylated NL genes from the extremity of Pv08L in cluster 08 G (Phvul.008G284500, Phvul.008G284600, Phvul.008G285300) (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S1). These latest observations suggest that methylation on NL genes could also be influenced by physical location, and especially by the proximity of khipu repeats.3.6. Common bean NL and khipu satellite DNA are massively targeted by 24-nt small RNAsBecause 24-nt sRNAs mediates RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) and transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) of transposable elements, we then analyzed the relationship between khipu satellites, NL genes and 24-nt sRNA populations. 3, 087, 771 redundant and 1, 895, 583 non-redundant reads of 24-nt sRNAs were sequenced in G19833 young leaf library (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Khipu sequences were abundantly mapped by 24-nt sRNAs with 2596 out of 2677 khipu sequences mapped with the selected criteria (Supplementary Table S2). Ninety out of 377 (24%) NL genes are predicted to be targeted by 24-nt sRNAs. As for DNA methylation, NL gene family seems to have a different profile compared with other gene families since for PPR and Homeobox families only 7 out of 498 (1.4%) and 1 out of 116 (0.9%) are targeted by 24-nt sRNAs, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). The analysis of chromosomal repartition reveals that almost all C-methylated non-TNL sequences of the cluster located at Pv04S (B4 cluster) are also targeted by 24-nt sRNAs (Figs 1 and 2). Strikingly, a different situation is observed for the phylogenetically closely related NL sequences located at the end of Pv11L (Co-2 cluster; Clade G) that are also DNA methylated but are mostly not predicted to be targeted by 24-nt sRNAs (Figs 1 and 2).3.7. NL expressionWe used publicly available RNA-seq data of common bean G19833 to study NL expression level in young trifoliate leaf tissue. Globally, the level of expression of NL was either low (286 NL genes with RPKM < 5) or not detected (48 NL genes with RPKM = 0). Only 22 NL genes can be considered as moderately expressed (‘medium’, with RPKM comprised between 5 and 200) (Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, with the exception of Phvul.002G021700, all the CCRPW8-NL genes belong to this ‘medium expression gene’ category. Another noteworthy element is that almost one third of the 22 moderately expressed NL genes, are from clade CNL-C (seven genes). Within the nine remaining moderately expressed NL genes, five reside on Pv04S, including one TNL and four CNL from clade CNL-H.4. DiscussionPreviously considered as an orphan crop, important genomic resources are now available in common bean thanks to the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies.68 Based on multiple omics data from the sequenced common bean genotype G19833,44,45 our results indicate that gene movements play a crucial role in NL evolution in common bean genome and that NL present an atypical DNA methylation pattern.4.1. NL evolution in common bean genome through both local amplification and sequence exchange between non-homologous chromosomesWe identified 377 NL-encoding genes in G19833 genome with approximately one third of TNL- and two thirds of non-TNL-encoding genes. As observed in other plant species, these NL sequences are mostly organized in clusters.18,19 In common bean most of the large NL clusters are located at the ends of the chromosomes and present a huge size compared to other species. This peculiar location has also been observed in several other plant species such as potato, tomato and cotton.19,69,70 However, this feature of NL clusters is not observed in all plant species and even in all Legume species since it has not been reported in Arabidopsis, Rice or Medicago.17,18,71 With regard to their huge size, it is particularly impressive for the NL clusters located at the end of Pv04S (B4 cluster), Pv11L (Co-2 cluster) and Pv10S, each containing more than 40 NL sequences. FISH analyses have revealed a subtelomeric location for B4 and Co-2 clusters.41 Distal regions of the chromosomes are highly recombinant compared to pericentromeric regions and are consequently favorable to promote NL amplification through unequal crossing-over.44,72,73 In agreement with that, we found that these three large NL clusters are composed of phylogenetically related NL, suggesting local amplifications of NL sequences. Similarly, in other plant species, extensive amplification of a few NL subfamilies have increased NL copy number considerably.74,75 On the other hand, some clusters are also composed of phylogenetically distant sequences, suggesting sequence exchange between non-homologous chromosomes. The present genome wide analysis shows that the B4 CNL are more similar to the Co-2 CNL that to any other CNL, confirming that the B4 cluster derives from the Co-2 cluster through an ectopic recombination between non-homologous chromosomes in subtelomeric regions.41 The same pattern has been observed in the phylogeny of the subtelomeric satellite DNA khipu, closely intermingled to NL sequences.43 These NL and khipu movement could have taken place in the context of sequence exchange between subtelomeres of non-homologous chromosomes as reported in human genome.76 Moreover, this proximity of NL with highly repeated sequences present on most of chromosome ends could promote unequal-crossing. Taking together these observations strongly suggest that in common bean, distal regions of the chromosomes are highly recombinant compared to pericentromeric regions and are consequently favorable to promote NL amplification through unequal crossing-over.4.2. Common bean NL genes display a transposon-like methylation pattern in their coding regionMethylC-seq performed on G19833 allowed us to sensitively measure cytosine methylation within specific sequence contexts on NL genes. According to current views of DNA methylation patterns in plants, gene body methylation occurs mainly in a CG context whereas non-CG methylation is limited to repeated sequences such as transposable elements and non-protein-coding repeats.35,77–81 Contrasting with this view, we observed that more than half of common bean NL genes are methylated in their gene body not only in CG but also in CHG and CHH. Consequently, in common bean, most NL genes are methylated like transposons in their coding regions but with a lower level (Table 2 and Fig. 4). This non-CG methylation pattern seems specific to the NL gene family since it was not observed for genes belonging to other gene families such as PPR or Homeobox transcription, even if some members were also located in subtelomeric regions (Supplementary Fig. S8). Moreover, NL neighboring genes do not present this atypical DNA methylation profile even if located in the same genomic environment, strongly suggesting that this atypical methylation profile is specific to the NL gene family and is not simply due to their location (Supplementary Fig. S7). This unusual DNA methylation profile and targeting by 24-nt sRNAs of NL gene family have not been described yet in other plant species. Therefore, this analysis should be extended to other gene families in common bean as well as in other plant species to see if this phenomenon is specific of NL genes in common bean. In plants, other atypical genes displaying in their coding region a transposon-like methylation pattern have been reported including Asr1 gene in tomato82 and CRP (Cystein-Rich Peptide) gene family in Arabidopsis.83 Interestingly, a possible retrogene origin has been proposed for CRP genes.4.3. What is responsible for DNA methylation on NL genes?Phylogenetic and positional relationships of methylated NL genes in the G19833 pseudomolecules revealed that methylation status of NL genes could be influenced by their nucleotide sequence (as exemplified in clades CNL-G; -H, -R) or physical location. It is noteworthy that physically clustered genes often present the same methylation pattern. For example, genes of clade CNL-A are found mostly methylated in regions containing khipu repeats whereas they are mostly unmethylated in other chromosomal regions. What is responsible for DNA methylation of NL genes?In plants, de novo cytosine methylation in the three sequence contexts and maintenance of methylation on asymmetric methylation sites (CHH) require the RdDM pathway, which involves numerous factors, including 24-nt sRNAs that guide methylation on homologous DNA sequences.22,84 While this pathway mainly targets repetitive elements, such as transposable elements, there are few reports of gene body methylation in the three contexts. One example is the CRP genes in Arabidopsis where cytosine methylation is partly dependent on the RdDM pathway83 and NL genes in common bean is an additional example. Indeed, in the present study, we showed that 90 NL genes (80/364 total NL genes mapped on G19833 pseudomolecules, 21.9%) are targeted by 24-nt sRNAs in their transcribed region. Strikingly, nearly all of them (76/80, 95%) are also highly gene-body methylated in the three sequence contexts as for example on Pv02L and Pv04S (B4 cluster) (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S9). Altogether, this suggests that in common bean, the RdDM pathway could target not only repeated sequences but also NL genes. This hypothesis is supported by the clear correlation between the NL gene body regions targeted by 24-nt sRNA and the methylated regions (Supplementary Figs S6 and S7). However, many C-methylated NL genes (61.4%; 121/197 mapped on G19833 pseudomolecules) are not targeted by 24-nt sRNAs, as for example most of the NL genes from Co-2 cluster (Pv11L), suggesting that another mechanism(s) (spreading of methylation see after), is responsible for cytosine methylation of these NL sequences. The B4 and Co-2 R clusters share many similarities: sequence content, subtelomeric physical location with proximity to khipu satellite sequences and high methylation status. However, they present a contrasting pattern regarding 24-nt sRNAs which target most of B4-NL but only few Co-2-NL (Fig. 1). Since the main difference between these two R clusters is the fact that B4 NL are young compare to Co-2 NL,41 it is tempting to speculate that this contrasting 24-nt pattern is due to their age difference. This is reminiscent of what has been described for retroelements, where RdDM, although targeted to transposons and repeats throughout the genome, is particularly notable at younger retroelements in Arabidopsis and in Gossypium raimondii.80,85–88Methylated NL clustered on Pv03S, Pv04S, Pv08L and Pv11L present common features. They are all located at chromosome extremities which are enriched in the satellite sequence khipu, previously found to be highly methylated in the three sequence contexts (CG, CHG, CHH). Several studies in plants have detailed that DNA methylation can « spread » beyond repetitive elements (TEs or tandem repeats), over 200–1000 bp.89,90 Consequently, we propose that the methylation pattern observed on NL genes of these chromosomal regions could result from a methylation spreading originating from the khipu sequences, especially on Pv03S, Pv08L and Pv11L (Co-2 cluster) where methylated NL genes are not targeted by 24-nt sRNAs.4.4. Biological role of cytosine methylation on NL genes: most of NL genes are expressed at a low level in common bean?In plants, cytosine DNA methylation is involved in regulation of gene expression during normal development. DNA methylation in the promoter region of genes, whatever the cytosine context, is associated with a transcriptional silencing of the corresponding gene (for example FWA, SDC).90,91 Concerning DNA methylation in coding region, its influence on expression depends on the sequence context of methylated cytosine and on the methylation level. Indeed, genome-wide analyses of DNA methylation and gene expression revealed that CG-gene body methylation is positively correlated with gene expression34,35,92,93 while CHG or CHH gene body methylation can be negatively associated with gene expression levels.82,83,94 In that context, even if the biological role of the transposon-like methylation pattern of the NL gene bodies is not yet clear, we propose that it is likely related to gene silencing. Our results are consistent with these observations since 87.3% of C-methylated NL (172/197 C-methylated NL) are very poorly expressed or even not detected in leave RNA-seq data. Consequently, in addition to the well described post-transcriptional gene silencing mechanisms of NL involving microRNAs targeting NL mRNA,95–97 our results suggest the existence of an additional regulation mechanism of NL at the transcriptional level. Together, these mechanisms could be essential to down-regulate resistance expression in plant during normal growth condition, in absence of pathogen attack. Indeed, resistance genes may impose a fitness cost on host plants, and consequently their expression needs a high degree of control.16 Since increasing data suggest that DNA methylation dynamically responds to biotic stress,28,29,98 we propose that this methylation could be withdrawn in the presence of the pathogen allowing NL expression only when needed. Consequently, this peculiar subtelomeric genomic environment may favor the proliferation of large NL gene clusters due to, not only increased recombination but also to some form of silencing allowing a large amplification of NL sequences without fitness cost, as it has been proposed for F-box superfamily in Arabidopsis.995. ConclusionIn the present report, we have shown that NL sequences can move in the common bean genome and are methylated in the three sequence contexts like transposable elements. Another element that brings NL and transposable elements closer is their ability to damage DNA. Indeed, if this feature is well known for transposable elements that can integrate DNA after cleavage of the insertion site by a transposase or an integrase,100,101 a recent study has revealed the potential of NL proteins to bind genomic DNA in planta102 and to induce DNA damage through nicking in vitro. Altogether this suggests that NL genes could be considered as retrogenes.We thank Christine Lelandais and Blake Meyers for fruitful discussions.

This study is the first to characterize the genome and develop a high-density genetic map of ramie and provides a basis for the genetic and molecular study of this crop.1. IntroductionRamie (Boehmeria nivea L. Gaud), popularly known as China grass, is a perennial herbaceous plant that belongs to the family Urticaceae. Ramie is one of the most important natural fiber crops, and the fiber extracted from its stem bast layer has several advantages over the fibers of other crops, such as long strands, a smooth texture, and high tensile strength. In addition, ramie is widely used as a livestock forage crop in southern China because it contains a high crude protein content in leaves and young stems (more than 20% of dry weight).1 Because of its fiber and nutritional feed properties, ramie has been widely planted in China, India, and other Asian and Pacific Rim countries.2 In China, ramie has been cultivated for more than 4,700 yrs.Both the fiber and forage of ramie are vegetative organs; therefore, high vegetative yields are required. In order to meet the demands of production, cultivated ramie has been domesticated to have vigorous vegetative growth. Generally, domesticated ramie can be harvested three times per year in China, and up to six times per year in well-watered cultivated environments.3 Therefore, plentiful bast fiber, a high crude protein content, and vigorous vegetative growth are three notable features of ramie, and understanding these traits in domesticated ramie would increase our knowledge of the evolution of this crop. Recently, by comparing the transcriptomes of wild and cultivated ramie, two positively selected genes that function in gibberellin metabolism and a Walls are thin 1 (WAT1)-related protein, respectively, were identified, which are probably involved in vegetative growth and bast fiber biosynthesis, respectively.4 However, because of the absence of ramie genome information, these important traits in domesticated ramie are still poorly understood.Ramie is a diploid species with 28 chromosomes (2n = 28), and its nuclear genome has been estimated to be approximately 716 Mb by flow cytometer analysis,5 which suggests that the nuclear genome is relatively simple and small. Therefore, it is feasible to perform whole-genome sequencing for this economically important crop. The nuclear genome of ramie has remained uncharacterized until now. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies are powerful and cost-effective methods of high-throughput sequence determination, which has made de novo genome sequencing feasible in non-model species. Over 80 plant species have had their complete genomes sequenced using NGS.6 These genomic resources can greatly accelerate our understanding of the molecular bases of traits and the evolutionary histories of species.To the best of our knowledge, ramie draft genome sequences were determined by NGS technology for the first time in the present study. Furthermore, in order to understand the traits in domesticated ramie, comparison and evolutionary analyses of the genome were performed. A high-density genetic map was constructed using a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) technique, which was used to anchor the draft genome sequences into the corresponding chromosome, thus developing an integrated genetic and physical map. This integrated map will be an exceptionally valuable tool for many genetic and genomic applications, such as fine-scale quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping and cloning. 2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and DNA extractionAn F2 agamous line (FAL) population consisting of 134 lines derived from two ramie varieties, Qingdaye (QDY) and Zhongzhu 1 (ZZ1), was developed based on the strategy described in our previous study,5 and was used for the development of the genetic map. All 134 FALs and two parents were planted at the experimental farm of the Institute of Bast Fiber Crops, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences, Changsha, China. Young leaf samples from each line were collected, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen (N), and preserved at -80°C until DNA extraction. Total genomic DNA was extracted from the fresh leaves using a DNA extraction kit (Tiangen, Beijing, China).2.2. Genome sequencing, data filtering, and assemblyThe genome of one ZZ1 parent was sequenced using a whole-genome shotgun strategy. Total genomic DNA was used to construct sequencing libraries. Short insert paired-end libraries (230 bp and 500 bp) were generated using a NEBNext® Ultra™ DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Large-insert (2 kb and 5 kb) DNA sequencing libraries were prepared through circularization by Cre-Lox recombination.7 Sequencing for all four libraries was performed using the Illumina sequencing platform (HiSeqTM 2500) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA).The raw reads obtained were subjected to the following quality control. Firstly, we discarded all reads with adapter contamination. Secondly, we ruled out low-quality reads with more than 10% ambiguous ‘N’ sequences. Thirdly, we removed reads that had over 50% of bases with quality scores of less than 5. The size, heterozygous ratio, and repeat ratio of the genome were estimated based on the k-mer frequency of the sequence reads (k = 17).8The clean, filtered reads were used for the de novo assembly of contigs, using a modified version of SOAPdenovo software that was developed specifically for the de novo assembly of the highly heterozygous jujube genome by Huang et al.,9 and the k value in K-mer was set at 41. The assembled genome has been deposited in DDBJ/ENA/GenBank under the accession NHTU00000000. Gaps on the scaffolds of each line were closed with reads using GapCloser 1.12 with the default parameters set (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapdenovo.html). Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) software and Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach (CEGMA) were used to evaluate the quality of the assembled genome.10,112.3. Gene prediction and annotationGenes in the assembled ramie genome were predicted by Augustus12 with a training set of Arabidopsis thaliana with the default parameters set. We also aligned the protein sequences of A. thaliana, Morus notabilis, Ziziphus jujuba, and Vitis vinifera to the ramie ZZ1 genome using TBLASTN with an E-value cutoff of 1e-3. Genes with complete encoding sequences were screened based on three standards: (1) the presence of start and stop codons; (2) the location of start or stop codons at the region far from the end of the scaffold with more than 10 bp; and (3) a coverage of sequence alignment between the encoded protein and its homolog in other species of more than 80%. All of the predicted genes were functionally annotated by comparing their protein sequences against the SwissProt,13 Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG),14 Gene Ontology (GO),15 and TrEMBL13 databases using BLASTP with an E-value threshold of 1e-4. Protein domains were identified by comparing the proteins to the InterPro database using InterProScan.16 A KEGG functional classification was performed by assigning the ramie genes to a pathway based on the KEGG database14 (www.genome.jp/kegg), and WEGO software17 (http://wego.genomics.org.cn/cgi-bin/wego/index.pl) was used to perform a GO functional classification of the genes, and to view the distribution of gene functions.2.4. Genomic comparison and evolutionary analysisTo better understand the evolutionary placement of ramie in the plant kingdom, we compared the ramie genome with those of other species and constructed their phylogenetic trees. Protein sequences from 10 plant species—A. thaliana (Ath),18,M. notabilis (Mno),19,Z. jujuba (Zju),20,V. vinifera (Vvi),21,Citrullus lanatus (Cla),22,Glycine max (Gma),23, Gossypium raimondii (Gra),24,Oryza sativa (Osa),25,Linum usitatissimum (Lus),26 and B. nivea (Bni) were extracted to build the gene families. For alternatively spliced isoforms, only the longest proteins were used in the analysis. The protein sequences were compared by an all-to-all BLASTP search with an E-value cutoff of 1e-5, and OrthoMCL27 was then used to cluster genes from these species into families with the parameter ‘-inflation 1.5.’ The proteins in single-copy gene families underwent multiple sequence alignments by MUSCLE with the default parameters set,28 which generated a super-alignment matrix. The super-alignment matrix of protein sequences was used to construct a phylogenetic tree using RAxML29 with the maximum likelihood algorithm. The MCMCTree program was used to estimate the time of species divergence (http://abacus.gene.ucl.ac.uk/software/paml.html) using the following settings: burn-in = 5,000,000, sample number = 1,000,000, and sample frequency = 50. In addition, two fiber biosynthesis-related gene families, i.e. cellulose synthase (CesA) and WAT1-like genes, were collected and compared from five species (Bni, Mno, Zju, Cla, and Lus). The Hmmersearch program30 was used to search the members of families of the five species, based on the conserved domain of PF03552.9: Cellulose_synt (CesA) and PF00892.15: EamA (WAT1-like genes), with the default parameters set. CesA and WAT1-like proteins from five investigated species underwent multiple sequence alignments by MUSCLE28 with the default parameters set, respectively. Based on the result of alignment, the phylogenetic tree was constructed with TreeBeST31 using the neighbor-joining (NJ) method, and a bootstrap test was conducted with 100 replications.2.5. Identification of genes subjected to positive selectionPositive selection is a process that favors the retention of beneficial mutations as well as the rapid diversification of affected genes. Positive selection at the DNA sequence level is often tested by estimating the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous nucleotide substitutions between homologous protein-coding gene sequences, and a ratio significantly higher than 1 is considered positive selection.4 A branch-site method32 has been developed to test positive selection on individual codons along specific lineages. Using this method, branches of the phylogenetic tree are divided a priori into foreground and background lineages, and the branch under test for positive selection is defined as the foreground branch, while all other branches on the tree are the background branches. Likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) based on branch-site model A33 ascertain the selective patterns of the genes and thus determine what genes underwent positive selection. Therefore, in this study, the branch-site likelihood method was chosen for identifying positively selected genes in ramie. Briefly, orthologous gene families among ramie and four other plant species (Mno, Zju, Cla, and Gma) were obtained through a multi-reciprocal blast search. The proteins in single-copy gene families underwent multiple sequence alignments using MUSCLE, with the default parameters set.28 Positively selected genes in the single-copy gene families were detected by LRTs based on branch-site models32 of phylogenetic analysis by maximum likelihood (PAML),33 with ramie as the foreground branch, and Mno, Zju, Cla, and Gma as the background branch. P-values were computed using the <U+03C7>2 statistic and corrected for multiple testing by the false discovery rate method. In order to avoid false positives in the test, genes with a low alignment quality were filtered using the following criteria: (1) a gene length of over 300 bp; (2) the number of positively selected sites = 2; and (3) no gap within three amino acids around the positively selected site in the five species. Enrichment of the GO functional categories was analyzed using GOseq, which is based on the Wallenius noncentral hypergeometric distribution.34 Q values were used to determine the P-value threshold in multiple tests and analyses,35 and GO categories with Q < 0.05 were considered significantly enriched.2.6. Genotyping by high-throughput sequencing in the FAL populationA GBS strategy was used to develop single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers. A GBS pre-design for restriction enzyme selection was performed by predicting enzyme combinations and evaluating the sizes of digested fragments according to the ramie ZZ1 genome. MseI and EcoRI were selected to construct the GBS libraries, which were constructed as follows. Firstly, for each line, 0.1–1 µg of genomic DNA was incubated at 37 °C with MseI (New England Biolabs, MA, USA; NEB), T4 DNA ligase (NEB), ATP (NEB), and MseI Y adapter N containing barcodes, and then heat-inactivated at 65 °C. EcoRI (NEB) enzymes were then added to the MseI digestions to further digest the fragments at 37 °C. Then, for each sample, the digested fragments with ligations were purified with Agencourt AMPure XP (Beckman Coulter, IN, USA) and subjected to polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification using Phusion® Master Mix (NEB) after adding universal primer and index primer. The PCR products of each sample were purified using Agencourt AMPure XP and pooled, then run on a 2% agarose gel. Fragments of 400–450 bp (with indexes and adaptors) were cut from the gel and purified with a gel extraction kit (QIAGEN, Valencia, CA, USA). The purified products were further cleaned with Agencourt AMPure XP prior to sequencing. Finally, paired-end sequencing was performed on the selected tags using an Illumina 2500 platform by Novogene Bioinformatics Institute, Beijing, China.2.7. Sequence data grouping, SNP identification, and linkage map constructionThe sequence data from each FAL were sorted according to the barcodes in the raw reads. To ensure that reads were reliable in the following analysis, the raw data (raw reads) were filtered according to the criteria that were described by previous studies.36,37 In brief, the filtering process included three stringent steps: (1) reads with =10% unidentified nucleotides (Ns) were removed; (2) reads with >50% of bases having a Phred quality <5 were removed; and (3) reads with >10 nt aligned to the adapter were removed, allowing =10% mismatches. Next, the clean reads filtered from each individual were aligned against the assembled ramie genome using BWA software10 (settings: mem –t - 4 –k 32 –MR), and the alignment files were converted to bam files using SAMtools software38 (settings: –bS –t). If multiple read pairs had identical external coordinates, only the pair with the highest mapping quality was retained.SNP identification was performed for the two parents and 134 FAL progenies using SAMtools software.39 To ensure SNP quality, only bases with a Phred quality =20 were used to identify SNPs by setting the SAMtools parameter as ‘-Q 20.’ Because the two parents were heterozygous, polymorphic markers between them were detected and classified into eight segregation patterns (ef × eg, nn × np, ab × cc, aa × bb, ab × cd, lm × ll, hk × hk, and cc × ab) according to the CP model in JoinMap 4.0 software.39 The numbers of SNPs and types of transitions or transversions were counted. Then, a Perl script was used to filter SNPs that had more than two genotypes, and polymorphic markers with a segregation pattern of aa × bb were reserved for use.Markers containing abnormal bases or exhibiting significantly distorted segregation (P < 0.001) or non-integrity (missing data in over 30% of progenies) were filtered by JoinMap 4.0. A regression algorithm, three-time circulation sequence, and Kosambi mapping function40 were used for marker distance calculation. The linkage map was drawn using Perl SVG.2.8. Anchoring sequenced scaffolds to the genetic mapSNP markers localized on the genetic map were used to anchor sequenced scaffolds of ZZ1 by the following method. Firstly, all of the markers were aligned against the assembled B. nivea scaffolds using BLASTN with an E-value threshold of 1e-15. Markers that were mapped to more than one scaffold were discarded. Then, the scaffold order on the chromosome was sorted by the mean value of markers on the same scaffold. In order to determine the orientation of the scaffold on the chromosome, we compared the physical order of the markers with their linkage map order. If the markers in a scaffold that had the same order between the physical and linkage map order were greater, the scaffold was considered in positive orientation. If the markers that had the same order between the physical and linkage map order were less, the orientation of the scaffold was negative and the sequence was reverse-complemented. Scaffolds in which the orientation was unknown remained in positive orientation by default. Finally, a visualized map of linkage groups that correlated with anchored scaffolds was constructed and exported to create an integrated genetic and physical map.3. Results3.1. Draft genome sequencing and assemblyA total of 212.8 and 91.2 million raw reads with a total size of 38.1 Gb were obtained in the short and large insert libraries, respectively. After filtering, 37.4 Gb clean sequences were used to de novo assemble the ramie genome, which resulted in 344,363 contigs and 293,578 scaffolds, with total sizes of 300,445,202 bp and 335,575,945 bp, respectively (Table 1). The maximum lengths of the contigs and scaffolds were 75,542 bp and 1,596,017 bp, respectively, and the N50 lengths of the contigs and scaffolds were 3,700 bp and 42,283 bp, respectively (Table 1). The GC content of the assembled ZZ1 genome was 36.9% (Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). The K-mer analysis revealed that the average depth of K-mer was 44 (Supplementary Fig. S2), suggesting that the estimated genome size was 448 Mb, and the heterozygous and repeat ratios in the ZZ1 genome were 1.48% and 58.89%, respectively. Therefore, the sequencing depth of the genome was approximately 85 folds, and the assembled scaffold covered 74.9% of the estimated genome. Statistics of genome assembly for ramieStatistics of genome assembly for ramieIn order to evaluate the quality of the assembled genome, all of the sequence reads were re-aligned into the assembled genome. We found that 87.1% of the reads could be mapped to the genome, and covered 97.7% of the assembled genome. A total of 993, 187 SNPs were identified in the ZZ1 genome, 32, 062 of which (accounting for 0.012% of the genome sequence) were homologous, suggesting that the base of the genome had a highly accurate ratio. CEGMA indicated that among 248 core eukaryotic genes, 242 (97.6%) were covered by the assembled genome, 219 of which were covered completely and 23 were partially matched.3.2. Gene prediction and annotation in the assembled genomeA total of 42,463 genes were predicted in the ramie genome, 12,664 of which were complete and the others were partial (Fig. 1a, Supplementary Table S1). Their coding sequences can be downloaded from https://figshare.com/articles/The_coding_sequences_of_42_463_genes_predicted_from_the_ramie_genome/5436268. Among the predicted genes, 26, 965, 27, 442, 29, 825, and 27, 379 encoded proteins that had significant homologs with proteins in Mno, Zju, Vvi, and Ath, respectively (Fig. 1b). A functional annotation was performed for the predicted genes, which revealed that of the 42, 463 genes, 28, 088, 29, 333, 29, 204, 40, 766, and 19,562 exhibited significant similarities to known proteins in the InterPro, KEGG, SwissProt, TrEMBL, and GO databases, respectively (Fig. 1c, Supplementary Table S2). In total, 40,922 (96.4%) genes were functionally annotated in at least one of these five databases. A GO functional classification of the predicted genes assigned 7, 836, 3, 653, and 13,257 genes to the GO classes of biological process, cellular component, and molecular function, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3). A KEGG classification revealed that these genes were assigned to 161 pathways, and the RNA degradation pathway enriched the most genes (Supplementary Fig. S4).

Developing an integrated genetic and physical map of ramieIn order to develop an integrated genetic and physical map, a high-density SNP marker genetic linkage map with a total length of 1942.9 cM was constructed (Table 2). A total of 4, 338 markers were included in this map (Supplementary Table S3), 2,965 of which were bin markers (Table 2). Thereafter, the ramie genome assembly was anchored into the high-density genetic map to construct an integrated genetic and physical map. Finally, in the integrated map, 924 scaffolds of about 58.2 Mb were anchored to the corresponding chromosome, and among 4,338 markers in the genetic map, 4,304 (99.2%) were mapped to the genome (Table 2, Fig. 2).

Genomic comparison and evolutionary analysisA total of 26,366 orthologous families of genes were identified among the 10 species investigated. Among these orthologous families, 6,977 appeared in all 10 species. In addition, an orthologous analysis of ramie and four other species (Mno, Zju, Cla, and Lus) identified 8,717 common families in the five species, and 1,075 families contained 4,082 genes that appeared only in ramie (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S4). These unique genes were markedly enriched in 32 GO terms, including the term ‘cellulose synthase (UDP-forming) activity’ (Q = 0.045) (Supplementary Table S5). Among these 4,082 genes, 5 and 10, respectively, were annotated as putative CesA and WAT1-related proteins. Analyzing the domain of proteins encoded by these 15 genes revealed that all five putative CesA proteins and 3 of 10 putative WAT1-related proteins had a corresponding conserved domain, suggesting that these five and three genes might be authentic CesA and WAT1-related genes, respectively, and that they are probably related to fiber yield in ramie. Subsequently, a phylogenetic analysis of the CesA and WAT1-related proteins of the five species (Bni, Mno, Zju, Cla, and Lus) revealed that the five CesA and three WAT1-related proteins were assigned into a branch into which none of the proteins of the other species fell (Supplementary Figs S5 and S6), confirming that the five CesA and three WAT1-related genes are unique to ramie. Among the 6,977 orthologs that appeared in the 10 species, 160 were single-copy in each species (Supplementary Table S6) and were more conservative, which can result in a more exact estimation of the evolutionary relationships between species. Therefore, these 160 single-copy orthologs were used for the phylogenetic analysis of 10 species, which resulted in the construction of a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 4). According to the phylogenetic tree, ramie and Mno were placed in a monophyletic clade that diverged about 51.4 million years ago, suggesting that ramie has the closest relationship with Mno among the species investigated (Fig. 4).

According to the tree, ramie has a relatively close relationship with Morus notabilis, and they diverged about 51.4 million years ago.3.5. Positively selected genesA total of 106 positively selected genes were identified in ramie (Supplementary Table S7). Of these, six functioned as transcription factors, including two NAC genes. These 106 genes were markedly enriched in 21 GO terms, including one interesting term, “N compound metabolism”, which was enriched by 22 genes (Q = 0.001) (Supplementary Table S8). The positive selection of N metabolism-related genes could be responsible for crude protein biosynthesis and vegetative growth in domesticated ramie.4. Discussion4.1. New genetic and genomic resourcesRamie is an important natural fiber in the textile industry because of its ability to retain shape, reduce wrinkling, and introduce a silky luster to the appearance of a fabric. There are also some flaws in ramie fiber, including confined elasticity and elongation potential, and the stiff and brittle nature of the cloth. Therefore, a variety with better quality fiber would be a desirable outcome of ramie breeding. However, trait improvement in ramie has been hindered by a shortage of genetic and genomic resources. Although a considerable number of ramie simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers have been developed,41,42 only one expanded and low-density molecular marker genetic map has been produced, and few QTLs have been detected for agronomic traits.5,43 There are probably still many QTLs missing, as shown by the QTL regions without markers observed in our low-resolution map. Therefore, a high-resolution ramie genetic map is needed. However, because the screening of population genotypes by SSR markers is time-consuming and labor-intensive, it is difficult to construct a high-resolution genetic map using SSR markers, even with sufficient markers. Moreover, few genes have been functionally characterized in ramie, and its genomic information is entirely unknown. Recently, the ramie transcriptome has been de novo assembled and characterized in several studies, and large numbers of expressed tag sequences (ESTs) were identified.2,4,44,45 However, because these ESTs were assembled using short read sequences, they contained many redundant sequences, and about 80% partial sequences.4 As a result, these sequences have not been used to uncover the mechanism of trait formation, or to improve traits.In the present study, a draft ramie genome was de novo assembled for the first time. Although the draft genome only covered about 74.9% of the estimated genome and had only an approximately 42.3-kb N50 scaffold, 97.6% of the core eukaryotic genes were covered in the draft genome. In other words, this genome assembly covered about 97% of ramie genes, suggesting that it could be used for further research in functional genomics. This genome is the first to be determined in the family Urticaceae, which comprises 45 genera with more than 700 species, and will be important for understanding the evolutionary placement of Urticaceae in the plant kingdom. Our results indicate that ramie has a close relationship with Mno, a species in the family Moraceae, suggesting that the evolutionary placement of Urticaceae as analyzed by genomic comparison is in agreement with the angiosperm phylogeny Group III (APG III) system.46 In addition, 42,463 genes were predicted, 96.3% of which were functionally annotated. Therefore, the number of annotated genes identified in the genome is far more than in the transcriptome.2,4 Large numbers of annotated genes were identified, which will not only be useful for the characterization of the functions of ramie trait-related genes but also provide a basis for uncovering the mechanism of trait formation.Furthermore, we developed the first high-resolution genetic map of ramie, which is not only an important tool for QTL identification but can also be used for assembling genome sequences into the chromosome. By anchoring the genome sequence to the chromosome, an integrated genetic and physical map was constructed. This will make genome utilization easier, particularly in fine-scale QTL mapping and cloning. The size of the assembled genome was about 335 Mb, and the high-density SNP map contained 2,965 bin markers. Therefore, the average physical distance between two bin markers was approximately 151 kb. However, because only four libraries with different fragment sizes were used for performing genomic analysis, the N50 length of scaffolds in the assembled genome was only about 42 kb. In other words, in the genome assembled, there were large numbers of sequence fragments that were smaller than the average physical distance between two bin markers on the map, which resulted in only 924 scaffolds of about 58.2 Mb (17.4%) that were assigned to the chromosomal location. Although 82.6% of the genome sequences had uncertain chromosomal locations, these sequences would still be useful in genetic and molecular studies of ramie, such as gene discovery, marker development, etc. Indeed, many species whose genome sequences have not been assigned to a chromosome have been widely used.19,264.2. Unique fiber biosynthesis-related genes are probably responsible for high fiber yield in ramieUnlike cotton fiber, which is an epidermal seed fiber, ramie fiber is a vegetative bast organ involved in sugar metabolism and cellulose synthesis; therefore, it has value in biological research into organogenesis and evolution. A major component of ramie fiber is cellulose, which is a chain of glucose residues. Cellulose biosynthesis can be divided into three steps: initiation of the sugar chain, elongation, and termination of the sugar chain.47 The initiation and elongation of cellulose is performed by CesA, which is a rosette-shaped enzyme complex in the plant cell plasma membrane,48 and catalytic subunits of CesAs are central catalysts involved in the generation of plant cell wall cellulose.49,50,CesA genes have been extensively studied in plants such as Arabidopsis, rice, cotton, and barley.51–54 Many CesA genes have also been reported in ramie.2,55,56 However, the mechanism by which ramie was domesticated as a crop with plentiful fiber in its stem bark is unknown. In this study, 16 putative CesA genes were identified in ramie (Supplementary Fig. S5). Based on an orthologous analysis among ramie and four other species (Mno, Zju, Cla, and Lus), five were found to be unique to ramie, which was validated by phylogenetic analysis. Moreover, the GO term ‘cellulose synthase (UDP-forming) activity’ was markedly enriched by these unique ramie genes. By comparing the sequence of five unique CesA ramie genes with the transcriptome reported in our previous study, we found that all five genes have ESTs (Unigene12687, CL3101.Contig2, Unigene306, Unigene10248, and Unigene26554), suggesting that these predicted genes are authentic. Interestingly, all five genes exhibited relatively higher expression levels in stem bark than in other organs, which indicates that they are probably involved in bast fiber biosynthesis.2 Therefore, these unique CesA genes are probably responsible for high fiber yield in ramie.WAT1 encodes a tonoplast-localized protein involved in secondary wall formation in fibers in Arabidopsis.57 A transcriptomic comparison of wild and cultivated ramie showed that the WAT1-related gene underwent positive selection, suggesting that it is probably related to the fiber yield of ramie, and that positive selection for this gene is probably responsible for the improvement of fiber yield in domesticated ramie.4 In this study, 13 putative ramie WAT1-related genes were identified (Supplementary Fig. S6). In addition, genome comparison identified 10 putative WAT1-related genes that were only found in ramie among the five species investigated. However, of these 10 genes, only three (Bni_g24740, Bni_g33701, and Bni_g35790) had the conserved domain of the WAT1-related protein. The absence of a conserved domain in the other seven residual genes was probably due to either an annotation error or an incomplete gene sequence. Therefore, three WAT1-related genes were included in the phylogenetic analysis, which confirmed their uniqueness in ramie among the five species investigated, and they are probably responsible for producing plentiful fiber in the ramie stem bast.4.3. Positive selection of N metabolism-related genes is probably responsible for vegetative growth and crude protein biosynthesis in domesticated ramieN is necessary for optimum growth and development in crop plants. Of the nutrient elements required by plants, N most often limits crop yield.58 In plants, N absorbed from the soil is converted to organic N compounds such as proteins, chlorophyll, and nucleic acids, which play numerous key roles in plant biochemistry and are essential components of enzymes, cell walls, and a vast array of other cellular components.59 Consequently, N compound metabolism is important for plant growth, and a deficiency in the supply of N would have a profound effect on plant survival and yield.Primary N utilization during vegetative growth involves three steps, i.e. uptake, translocation, and assimilation.60 N assimilation is a complex metabolic process, and six key enzymes, nitrate reductase (NR), nitrite reductase (NiR), glutamine synthetase (GS), glutamate synthase (GOGAT), asparagine synthetase (Asp), and asparagine aminotransferase (AspAT), are involved.61 There are three main steps involved in the metabolism of N assimilation. Firstly, when the N is absorbed and transferred into the cell, it is first reduced to ammonium by NR and NiR. Then, the ammonium enters the GS and GOGAT cycle where it is converted to glutamine and glutamate. Finally, the glutamate amino group can be transferred to different amino acids by Asp and AspAT,61 and these amino acids are used to synthesize N compounds.Ramie exhibits vigorous vegetative growth, along with a high crude protein content in its tissues. Recently, three N metabolism-related GS genes were identified in ramie,62 and one of these, BnGS1-2, was overexpressed in transgenic tobacco, which caused significant increases in fresh weight, dry weight, and plant height, along with a higher soluble protein content and higher total N content.63 Therefore, these previous studies further validated that, in ramie, N metabolism-related genes play important roles in vegetative growth and crude protein biosynthesis. A total of 22 positively selected genes were found to enrich the GO term ‘cellular nitrogen compound metabolic process’, so they may be N metabolism-related genes. Among the 22 genes, one encodes the Asp protein, which is a key enzyme in N-assimilation.61 In addition, three genes encode transcription factor proteins, and seven are involved in DNA/RNA activity. Previous studies have found that N metabolism is regulated by the BTB gene64 and is affected by abscisic acid (ABA) and auxin;65 here, we identified three positively selected genes that encode an ABA and an auxin-related protein, and a BTB/POZ domain protein. The other eight genes enriched in this GO term encode an uncharacterized protein. The rapid diversification of these genes is probably responsible for the high crude protein content and vigorous vegetative growth of domesticated ramie.5.

IntroductionMeiotic recombination promotes population diversity by reshuffling parental genetic variants into the next generation and providing novel combinations of genes for selection and evolution.1–5 Meiotic recombination is also important in determining proper chromosomal segregation.4 Recombination hotspots are usually clustered into narrow genomic regions that are specified by the PR domain-containing 9 (PRDM9) gene in human and mouse.6–9 The high polymorphism level (number and type) in the tandem-repeat zinc finger (ZnF) regions of PRDM9 has drawn wide interest and attention.10–12 In mammals, the number of PRDM9 ZnF varies from 6 to 19 with highly diverse ZnF components between and within species, likely evolving under strong positive selection.4,10,13–15 Some species, like canids, carry inert versions of PRDM9 genes with multiple disruptive mutations.16,17 Although the polymorphism level of PRDM9 is dramatically higher than other genes in many mammalian species, the diversity of PRDM9 has only recently been documented in cattle (Bos taurus),18,19 which has been domesticated since the Neolithic period20 and whose effective population size continued to shrink from tens of thousands prior to domestication to hundreds at present.21Considerable variation in recombination rate between individuals has been documented in mammals and other species.22–26 A recent study reported different locations of double-strand breaks between PRDM9 alleles in humans, indicating a critical role of PRDM9 in individual-level variations of recombination.27,PRDM9 has also been shown to drive evolutionary erosion of hotspots in Mus musculus through haplotype-specific initiation of meiotic recombination.28 In a further study of Mus musculus PRDM9, Smagulova et al. found hotspot erosion governed the preferential usage of PRDM9 alleles and increased sequence diversity at hotspots that become active in the hybrids.28 Because crossovers were disfavored at such hotspots, it was assumed that sequence divergence generated by hotspot turnover may create an impediment for recombination in hybrids, potentially leading to reduced fertility and, eventually, speciation. Through these mechanisms, PRDM9 has been considered as an important player in speciation.29 Moreover, re-engineering the ZnFs of PRDM9 with human alleles reversed hybrid sterility in mouse.30 Despite the important role of PRDM9 on recombination, a genome-wide evaluation of the recombination patterns of different PRDM9 alleles has been lacking in mammals, mainly due to the limited pedigree data in mammalian species.Large-scale pedigree data are crucial for reconstructing fine-scale recombination maps and for studying patterns of recombination. Genomic evaluations in the cattle industry have accumulated tons of genotype data with pedigree information. The USDA-ARS Animal Genomics and Improvement Laboratory (AGIL) maintains a large database that includes millions of genotyped cattle, a unique resource for studying meiotic recombination with unprecedented power. In a large-scale study of cattle pedigree, recently, we have reported strikingly different recombination patterns between males and females, and identified several loci associated with recombination rate and hotspot usage in both sexes, including the PRDM9 gene on chromosome 1.31 Additionally, in contrast to human and mouse studies that reported a male to female ratio of 0.6:0.9 in genome-wide recombination rate,22,32,33 a much higher ratio of 1.1:1.2 was found in cattle,31,34 suggesting marked divergence in the sex-specific recombination rate in these placental mammals. However, it remains unclear what the causative mutations are for the cattle PRDM9 association and how PRDM9 alleles impact recombination features.While pedigree-based studies have been widely applied, there are two other methods for measuring recombination based on either linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns or sperm typing. Sperm typing and single-sperm genomics evaluate recombination at either a regional scale or genome-wide level.35,36 Although global recombination maps obtained by these methods are more or less consistent with one another,37 measurable local differences that attributed to different genetic features cannot be ruled out. Using single sperm genomics approach, Wang et al. reported an average of 22.8 recombination events, 5 to 15 gene conversion events, and 25 to 36 de novo mutations in human sperm cells.36 Using the same method, another study reported aneuploidy in 4% of the cells and 26 recombination events per single-sperm cell in humans.38 These studies affirmed the robustness of single sperm genomics as alternative to pedigree-based approaches in recombination research.Using large-scale pedigree analysis and genome-wide single sperm genomics, the objective of this study was to (1) Characterize PRDM9 ZnF sequence variations in two cattle breeds; (2) Correlate different PRDM9 alleles with recombination features and generate PRDM9 allele-specific recombination maps in two sexes of cattle; and (3) Assess the reliability of pedigree and single sperm-typing based approaches and compare recombination patterns between sperms and live-born offspring.2. Materials and methods2.1. Validation of bovine PRDM9 gene structureThe Ensembl database has two coding sequences for the Zinc finger (ZnF) repeat of the bovine PRDM9 gene, located respectively at Chr1: 45, 034, 069-45, 034, 571 (ZnF1) and Chr1: 45, 078, 067-45, 078, 685 (ZnF2).39 Using evidence from multiple sources, we confirmed ZnF1 as the correct ZnF coding sequence for PRDM9. First, we separately amplified the two ZnF repeat regions using genomic DNA of eight bulls from two cattle breeds (Holstein and Hereford). Due to the high diversity in the ZnF regions of PRDM9 in other species, we expected to observe polymorphisms in the ZnF region of bovine PRDM9. However, we found nucleotide variation in only the ZnF1 region; no polymorphisms were observed in the ZnF2 region. To further validate the two ZnF sequences for PRDM9, we attempted to amplify them from the cDNA of bovine testis tissue using two specifically designed primers. Only ZnF1 was successfully amplified (Supplementary Fig. S1). The reverse primer for ZnF1 is located in a non-coding region, suggesting that ZnF1 and ZnF2 are disconnected in the mRNA level. These results were used to confirm the gene structure of bovine PRDM9, and we used the ZnF1 region of PRDM9 in all following analyses.2.2. Amplification and sequencing of cattle PRDM9 ZnF repeatsCattle testis tissues were collected as per the ethical guidelines of USDA-ARS animal use and care protocol. The testis was snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately after excision and kept at -80 °C until further use. Total RNA was isolated and reverse-transcribed to cDNA. Frozen semen and somatic tissue of animal HOUSA000072190767 (Supplementary Table S2), together with its parent somatic tissues were donated by Selected Sires, Inc (Plain City, OH, USA). Other Holstein and Jersey cattle DNA samples were obtained from the Cooperative Dairy DNA Repository (CDDR) at USDA-ARS. The PCR and sequencing primers were designed using Primer-BLAST,40 and the PRDM9 gene in the cattle reference genome (UMD 3.1.1) was used as template.41 We confirmed the specificity of primers by comparing with the newest version of the cattle genome (Btau_5.0.1, GCA_000003205.6). The primer pairs for PCR amplification using cDNA as the template were designed by crossing two or more exons to avoid potential DNA contamination. The primer pairs for PRDM9 ZnF repeat amplification were designed with 579 bp (5' end) and 157 bp (3' end) of unique, non-repetitive flanking sequences around the ZnF repeat. All the primers used in the present study are listed in Supplementary Table S1.The PCR amplification was performed with 50 µL reaction volume according to Taq DNA polymerase manufacturer’s protocol (Taq PCR Master Mix Kit, Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and the genomic DNA was amplified on a bioRad MyIQ thermocycler. The PCR cycle for PRDM9 ZnF repeat amplification was as follows: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 5 min; followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 45 s, annealing at 63 °C for 40 s; primer extension at 72 °C for 1 min 20 s; and final extension at 72 °C for 10 min. All the amplified products were run in 1.5% agarose gel, the bands were cut, and DNA was purified with the MinElute Gel Extraction Kit provided by the Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Purified PCR products were ligated to the pGEM-T Easy vector using the pGEM-T Vector System I (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and transformed into DH5a (subcloning efficiency) competent cells (Invitrogen/Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Examples of Agarose gel electrophoresis of PCR products are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. At least 10 single colonies for each PCR product were randomly picked. Plasmid was extracted using Plasmid Miniprep System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and sequenced using the T7 and SP6 primers at two companies, GENEWIZ (South Plainfield, NJ, USA) and Macrogene (Rockville, MD, USA).To account for the short tandem repetitive nature of ZnF repeats, only forward and reverse sequences with sufficient overlap (at least 168 nt sequences covering two ZnF repeats) were used to prepare the contig and the consensus sequence for each clone was obtained. We used at least three clones with identical sequence to support a valid consensus sequence. To get both alleles with the same length from an individual, we generated at least six assembled sequences for each PCR product and used more clones for those individuals whose two alleles showed an unbalanced ratio. The detailed clone number and allele information for all animals were listed in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3.2.3. Estimation of recombination rate in cattle pedigreeWe used similar approaches as describe before.42 In brief, we extracted three-generation families from Holstein and Jersey pedigree. Within a family, we require that the offspring, at least one parent, and at least one grandparent were genotyped by single nucleotide polymophism (SNP) arrays. In a three-generation family, we phased the two haplotypes of an animal (second and third generations) based on the parental genotypes, and crossover locations were identified by comparing either a paternal or maternal haplotype of an offspring (third generation) to its corresponding parent’s two haplotypes (second generation). Based on the location of a crossover, a recombination event was assigned to an interval flanked by two SNPs that are informative (phased heterozygote in the second generation). To construct recombination maps of SNPs, we estimated recombination rate between consecutive SNPs based on the identified crossover events by assigning a recombination event as equal probabilities to all consecutive SNP intervals between the two informative SNPs. When constructing recombination maps, we only included high-quality data where all members of a three-generation family were genotyped by at least 50 K SNP chips. For quality control purposes, we also removed animals (<1%) that have more than 45 crossover events genome-wide, based on the distribution of crossover events in all data. The sex chromosomes were excluded from all analyses due to the poor quality of the genome assembly.2.4. Global and local comparisons of recombination mapsTo show the global distribution of recombination rates along the chromosomes, we adopted a smooth spline model of recombination rates against relative physical locations on chromosomes using the smooth spline function implemented in R 3.2.4.42,43 We divided the recombination data into subgroups based on the PRDM9 genotype and sex and generated global recombination maps for each of the PRDM9 alleles in both males and females.To identify PRDM9 dependent hotspot regions, we compared recombination rate locally in a SNP interval between three PRDM9 genotypes of allele 5 (allele 5 homozygote, allele 5 heterozygote and non-allele 5 genotypes). Given a SNP interval and a pair of groups, we generated a 2 × 2 table of recombination data (number of meioses w/o recombination in two genotype groups) and applied a <U+03C7>2 test to determine whether recombination rate is different between the two groups. Since the frequency of allele 5 in Holsteins is about 9%, there are unbalanced numbers of animals for the three genotype groups for allele 5 (allele 5 homozygote, heterozygote, and non-allele 5 homozygote). Male and female data also have different sample sizes. To account for the issue of unbalanced sample sizes, we used evidence from multiple sources to select the most significant allele-specific hotspots for allele 5 based on the following rules: (1) Same direction of the difference in recombination rate for males and females; (2) P-value for the comparison between allele 5 homozygote and non-allele 5 genotypes is less than 0.05; (3) P-value in the comparison of allele 5 heterozygote versus allele 5 homozygote or non-allele 5 genotypes is less than 0.05; and (4) At least one P-value from (2) or (3) is less than 2 × 10-6. For non-allele 5, we excluded the comparison between allele 5 homozygote and non-allele 5 genotypes due to the very limited sample sizes and low statistical power.2.5. Whole genome amplification, genotyping and quality control of single sperm DNASperm cells were obtained from semen samples stored in liquid nitrogen. Frozen semen was thawed in 37 °C water for 30–45 s. Sperms were diluted by PBS + 1% BSA and washed twice. Then the sperms were further diluted to a proper resolution using PBS + 1% BSA on a petri-dish, and active single sperms were picked up manually by pipetting into a reaction tube under micromanipulator. Whole-genome amplification was performed according to the manufacturer’s protocol using a Single Cell Whole Genome Amplification Kit (Yikon Genomics, Shanghai, China) based on the MALBAC (Multiple Annealing and Looping Based Amplification Cycles) technology. In brief, a single sperm was initially lyzed and pre-amplified by primers supplied in the kit with eight cycles with multiple annealing steps. Fragments with variable length at random starting positions were generated by polymerase extension for multiple cycles by exponential amplification step. PCR products were purified and sent to Neogen/GeneSeek (Lansing, MI, USA) for genotyping by the Illumina® BovineHD Genotyping BeadChip assay. PCR amplification quality was confirmed by showing the percentage of SNP successfully genotyped per Mb evenly distributed along the whole genome (Supplementary Fig. S3). To improve the genotyping accuracy for single sperms, we applied a stringent cut-off on the raw genotyping quality score to call genotypes, eliminated heterozygous SNP calls, and removed SNPs that had conflict with the sire genotype. In total, we performed whole genome amplification for 97 single sperms.2.6. Phasing and inferring crossovers in single spermsGenomic DNA of Animal 102 and the parents were extracted from ear tissues and genotyped together with single sperm DNA at GeneSeek using Illumina® BovineHD Genotyping BeadChip assay. Heterozygous SNPs (hetSNPs) of the bull were phased to two haploids (paternal and maternal) based on the genotypes of two parents. In total, over 76.33% of the 193,066 hetSNPs were phased. Before inferring crossovers in sperms, we applied additional quality control procedures, including general call score = 0.7 for a SNP and homozygote rate = 0.8 for a sample (Supplementary Fig. S4 and Supplementary Table S4). After quality control (QC), single sperm samples had phased hetSNP numbers ranging from 11,762 to 87,648. To improve accuracy, we applied the Viterbi algorithm in a hidden Markov model in R to identify crossovers in the sperm haplotype as a transition between paternal and maternal status.43 After filtering samples with abnormal numbers of crossovers (>45), we obtained 1,526 autosomal crossover events from 56 high quality single sperms. Using pedigree data of the same bull, we identified 12,089 crossovers from 556 offspring that were genotyped with 7 K, 10 K or 50 K SNP chips.3. Results3.1. ZnF variants of PRDM9 in two cattle breedsDue to the highly repetitive nature of PRDM9 ZnFs, next-generation sequencing is unable to accurately measure the target sequence because one read cannot capture the full length of the ZnF region. To fully characterize genetic variation of cattle PRDM9, we PCR-amplified, cloned, sequenced, and phased the ZnFs of PRDM9 for 25 and 17 influential bulls, respectively, for Holstein and Jersey, the two most common breeds of dairy cattle in the US. Based on amino acid composition, a total of ten different ZnF arrays (color coded in Fig. 1) and five different alleles (combination of multiple ZnF arrays) were recovered from the 42 bulls that are representative of the dairy population because these chosen bulls typically had thousands of daughters and sons (Supplementary Table S2). The five alleles of PRDM9 were named by the order of allele frequency in the Holstein sample. In contrast to primate and mouse PRDM9 that has 6–19 ZnF repeats,10,11 the cattle PRDM9 appears to have fewer ZnF repeats, ranging from 6 to 7 for each allele (Fig. 1a). With exception of allele 3 that possesses seven ZnF repeats, all the remaining alleles consist of six repeats. Despite the small effective population size of domestic cattle,21the amino acid residues at positions –1, 3 and 6 of the ZnF a helix, which were predicted to be in contact with DNA motifs,11,44 are highly polymorphic. Note that the ten different ZnF arrays may have the same composition at these three positions as ZnF arrarys were defined by the full length amino acid sequence. At the nucleotide level, all of the changes at these three sites are non-synonymous. The amino acid alignments of the cattle ZnF repeats with the corresponding repeats of other species, including human, rhesus monkey, rat and mouse, are shown in Supplementary Fig. S5. While the ZnFs of cattle PRDM9 show consistent patterns with other species, several amino acid residues are unique to cattle. For example, cattle have Serine and Glycine at positions –4 and –9, respectively, but the corresponding positions in all other species are Glycine and Arginine (Supplementary Fig. S5). PRDM9 alleles and ZnF arrays in Holstein and Jersey cattle. (a) Allele and ZnF array information in Holstein and Jersey cattle. ZnF arrays were coded from A to J according to the full length amino acid composition, and the three important sites were shown (–1, 3 and 6) that may be same for different ZnF arrays. Alleles were coded from allele 1 to allele 5 based on their ZnF array composition. (b) PRDM9 gene structure and comparison between non-allele 5 and allele 5. Four domains (KRAB, SET, single ZnF, 6 to 7 ZnF repeats) were present in bovine PRDM9. Allele 5 was perfectly linked with the minor allele of the SNP at Chr1: 45112924 (R2 = 1). Comparing between non-allele 5 and allele 5, amino acid frequencies at each positions were shown as proportional to the size of the letters (one ZnF includes 28 amino acids). Positions with different amino acid components between allele 5 and other alleles were highlighted by “*”.PRDM9 alleles and ZnF arrays in Holstein and Jersey cattle.

Four domains (KRAB, SET, single ZnF, 6 to 7 ZnF repeats) were present in bovine PRDM9. Allele 5 was perfectly linked with the minor allele of the SNP at Chr1: 45112924 (R2 = 1). Comparing between non-allele 5 and allele 5, amino acid frequencies at each positions were shown as proportional to the size of the letters (one ZnF includes 28 amino acids). Positions with different amino acid components between allele 5 and other alleles were highlighted by “*”.Although we identified five alleles in the Holstein cattle (Supplementary Table S2), only four alleles (alleles 1–4) were observed in Jerseys (Supplementary Table S3). As the two breeds are closely related, we observed minor differences in allele frequency between Holstein and Jersey (Fig. 1a). For instance, allele 1 is most frequent in Holstein (38%), but allele 2 appears to be dominant in Jersey (41.2%). The most striking difference between the two breeds is the uniqueness of allele 5 in Holstein (8%). Interestingly, allele 5 is the most distinct allele compared to other alleles with no shared ZnF arrays between allele 5 and non-allele 5 (Fig. 1b). The amino acid alignments between allele 5 and the rest of the alleles revealed unique amino acid substitutions at the DNA-contact sites (i.e. –1, 3 and 6) and nearby positions (–2 and 2). Consistently, allele 5 and non-allele 5 (referred to as the rest of the alleles) were predicted to preferentially recognize distinct DNA motifs (Supplementary Fig. S6). In a previous genome-wide association study (GWAS) study of recombination in cattle, we identified a SNP (rs110661033, Chr1: 45113934) downstream of the PRDM9 gene that was associated with genome-wide hotspot usage and recombination rate.42 Intriguingly, the minor allele ‘A’ of SNP rs110661033 was perfectly linked with PRDM9 allele 5 in the current study (R2 = 1; Supplementary Table S2). All the Holstein bulls that carry one copy of allele 5 are heterozygous at SNP rs110661033 (G/A). We further confirmed this linkage between PRDM9 (non-allele 5/allele 5) and SNP rs110661033 (G/A) by sequencing PRDM9 in an additional five Holstein bulls selected by the SNP genotype, in which two animals are heterozygous at rs110661033 and carry one copy of allele 5 at PRDM9, and three bulls are homozygous (A/A) at rs110661033 and carry two copies of allele 5 (Supplementary Table S2). Altogether, these results demonstrate that PRDM9 ZnF alleles are likely the causative mutations associated with the recombination features in cattle, with PRDM9 allele 5/non-allele 5 combinations fully explaining the association between rs110661033 and recombination rate and hotspot usage that we previously reported.423.2. PRDM9 allele-specific recombination maps for holsteinSuperior bulls have been extensively used in dairy cattle breeding through artificial insemination. In the national dairy database maintained at AGIL, a bull typically has hundreds to thousands of daughters genotyped. The 25 Holstein bulls selected for sequencing of PRDM9 were chosen because they have large numbers of genotyped offspring to study recombination (Supplementary Table S2). To have an overview of the recombination patterns of PRDM9 alleles, we divided the 25 Holstein bulls into six groups based on their PRDM9 genotypes: allele 1 homozygote, allele 2 homozygote, allele 1/2 heterozygote, allele 3 carrier (homozygote or heterozygote), allele 4 carrier (homozygote or heterozygote), and allele 5 carrier (heterozygote). After splitting, each group has 3 to 6 bulls and more than 2, 300 offspring genotyped by 50 K SNP chips, allowing us to generate PRDM9-specific recombination maps for individual groups (Supplementary Fig. S7). The six recombination maps exhibited similar global patterns of recombination with two peak regions, one near the 10% from the beginning of a chromosome and the other to the end. However, allele 5 carrier group showed a larger recombination rate than other alleles at both peak regions. Note that the difference between allele 5 carrier group and other groups is small due to the limitation of sample size and mixed grouping of heterozygote and homozygote individuals. Still, this observation is consistent with the observed differences in protein sequences between the five alleles, where allele 5 has the most distinct ZnFs compared to other alleles.Using an imputation-based approach, we next aimed at generating allele-specific recombination maps for each of the five PRDM9 alleles. Based on the LD patterns between PRDM9 alleles and nearby SNPs or haplotypes in the 25 Holstein bulls, we identified markers tagging each of the five PRDM9 alleles (Supplementary Table S5). Using this tagging information, we extracted all available recombination data and constructed recombination maps for each of the five PRDM9 alleles in both males and females (Fig. 2). In total, we extracted 1,369,139 three-generation families in Holstein, with each family including one offspring, at least one parent (maternal or paternal), and at least one grandparent. A total of 239,116 three-generation families were genotyped by chips with at least 50 K SNPs. We inferred over 3.7 million paternal and over 2 million maternal crossover events from these three-generation families. As mentioned previously, SNP rs110661033 was in perfect LD with allele 5 with a maximum R2 value of 1. Using this SNP (MAF = 9.4%) as a tagging marker, we extracted all animals (bulls and cows) carrying allele 5 and the corresponding three-generation families, with the number of families for allele 5 homozygote, allele 5 heterozygote and non-allele 5 homozygote genotypes being 637, 28, 759 and 120, 990 in males and 719, 15, 548 and 72, 513 in females, respectively. Similarly, using tagging haplotypes or SNPs, we extracted animals and three-generation families for each of the other four alleles (Supplementary Table S5).

The relative physical position on a chromosome is used, where zero corresponding to the beginning of a chromosome and one the end. The smooth spline model was fitted across all of the 29 autosomes.With an expanded data set using imputation, we assembled enough data to generate recombination maps for each of the five PRDM9 alleles in two sexes (Fig. 2). Across the five alleles, the average number of crossovers for males and females are 25.10 and 22.74, respectively, which is consistent with previously reported higher recombination rate in bulls than in cows.42 While males and females exhibited different recombination maps across the genome, most notably near the end of chromosomes, PRDM9 alleles were associated with differences in global recombination maps within each sex (Fig. 2). One striking observation was that among the five PRDM9 alleles, allele 5 showed the largest recombination maps in both sexes (Fig. 2a and b). Bulls with allele 5 homozygote, allele 5 heterozygote and non-allele 5 homozygote genotypes had a genetic map length of 27.0, 25.7 and 24.9 Morgans, respectively; and for cows, the map length dropped to 23.6, 23.4 and 22.6 Morgans for the three genotypes, respectively. These results also confirmed the previous association of SNP rs110661033 with genome-wide recombination rates with the minor allele (linked with allele 5) increasing recombination rate.42 For both males and females, the largest difference in recombination rate between PRDM9 alleles fell into the two recombination peak regions, with animals carrying two copies of allele 5 having highest recombination rate and animals carrying other alleles showing lower recombination rates (Fig. 2c and d). Interestingly, animals carrying one copy of allele 5 (heterozygote) have recombination rates in between the two homozygotes, but are closer to allele 5 homozygous animals, especially in the recombination peak regions. Since allele 5 clearly stands out from the rest PRDM9 alleles in protein composition and recombination patterns, we generated three recombination maps for the three genotypes of allele 5 and non-allele 5 in each of the two sexes (Supp_Data_1).3.3. PRDM9 allele-specific recombination maps in JerseyThe 17 sequenced Jerseys had four PRDM9 alleles (alleles 1–4) and seven genotype combinations (Supplementary Table S3). Similarly, we evaluated the LD patterns between PRDM9 alleles and nearby SNPs or haplotypes in the Jersey samples and identified allele-tagging markers for Jersey (Supplementary Table S6). As the genotyped pedigree is smaller in Jersey than in Holstein, we focused on allele 2 that had enough data to study allele-specific recombination maps. In total, 11 of 17 animals with allele 2 carry at least one minor allele of SNP Hapmap26498-BTA-33060. An association test further confirmed the correlation between this SNP and genome-wide hotspot usage in Jersey (P  = 5.4 × 10-3). Note that this SNP was not linked with allele 2 in Holsteins, possibly due to different LD patterns between cattle breeds. Using this tagging marker of allele 2 (MAF = 41%), we assembled 26, 945, 71, 726 and 52, 870 three-generation families for allele 2 homozygote, allele 2 heterozygote and non-allele 2 homozygote genotypes, respectively. Among these families, 3,959, 5,660 and 2,106 were genotyped by 50 K SNP chips in males, and 1,016, 1,214 and 262 genotyped by 50 K chips in females. The male map lengths are 23.3, 23.6 and 24.1 Morgans for allele 2 homozygote, allele 2 heterozygote and non-allele 2 genotypes, respectively; while female maps are 22.0, 22.0 and 22.6 Morgans in length, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S8). Consistent with the patterns found in Holstein, main differences between PRDM9 alleles in Jersey were also found in the two recombination peak regions: in the centromere peak region, allele 2 homozygote map had the lowest recombination rate in both males and females; and in the telomere region, allele 2 carriers had the lowest recombination rate in females and was close to the lowest in males. Note that recombination rate in Jersey is in general slightly smaller than that in Holstein, likely due to lower polymorphism levels of markers in Jersey as the SNP chips were originally designed for Holstein.3.4. PRDM9 allele-specific hotspot regionsRecombination rates were calculated between consecutive SNPs for animals that carry different PRDM9 alleles, showing allele-specific distributions of recombination across the cattle genome (Fig. 3). We here used the term ‘hotspot region’ instead of ‘hotspot’ because our SNP intervals were much larger (average 44 Kb) than typical recombination hotspot regions in human and mouse studies. We focused on the most distinct PRDM9 alleles in this analysis, allele 5 and non-allele 5. To find allele-specific hotspot regions for allele 5 and non-allele 5, we applied a <U+03C7>2 test to identify SNP intervals with significantly different recombination rate between the three genotypes of allele 5 and non-allele 5 in both sexes of Holstein (Fig. 3; Tables 1 and 2). Based on the genome-wide significance level of 8.3 × 10-7 after Bonferroni correction, in males, we identified seven SNP intervals with different recombination rate between allele 5 homozygote and non-allele 5 genotypes, 369 intervals between allele 5 heterozygote and non-allele 5 genotypes, and only 1 interval between allele 5 homozygote and allele 5 heterozygote, respectively. In females, the numbers of intervals with different recombination rate between the three genotypes were 2, 36 and 0, respectively. The different number of identified intervals for these comparisons reflected different sample sizes and statistical power, because the recombination data involved more bulls than cows and had more animals carrying non-allele 5 than allele 5. To account for the issue of unbalanced sample sizes, we adopted multiple evidence to select the most significant allele-specific hotspot regions of allele 5:(1) Same direction of the difference in recombination rate for males and females, (2) Small P-value for the comparison between allele 5 homozygote and non-allele 5 genotype, and (3) Small P-value in the comparison of allele 5 heterozygote versus allele 5 homozygote or non-allele 5 genotype. For non-allele 5, we dropped the comparison between allele 5 homozygote and non-allele 5 genotype due to the limited sample sizes and low statistical power.

Different colors were used to distinguish the 29 chromosomes.Among the top 5 hotspot regions of allele 5, one hotspot region, located at chr13: 14923596-15017558, is shared between males and females (Table 1). In males, the recombination rate increased 13 fold from 0.0006 to 0.009 between animals with non-allele 5 and two copies of allele 5. In females, animals carrying two copies of allele 5 showed a 5-fold increase. To further investigate the recombination patterns of allele-specific hotspot regions, we zoomed into the local recombination maps of the three PRDM9 genotypes of allele 5 (Supplementary Fig. S9). Generally, for the allele 5 favored hotspot regions, we found a striking peak of the recombination rates of allele 5 compared to other genotypes. As for non-allele 5 hotspot regions, we also observed higher recombination rates for animals carrying alleles other than 5. In both cases, recombination rates of allele 5 heterozygote would mimic either allele 5 or non-allele 5 since the heterozygote animals had both alleles and binding motifs.

Dominant effect of allele 5 on recombination in two sexesUsing both sharing of recombination hotspot region and correlation in recombination rate, we found animals carrying one copy of allele 5 were more similar to animals with two copies of allele 5 than to animals carrying non-allele 5. To evaluate the sharing of recombination hotspot region, we tentatively defined hotspot regions as the SNP intervals with recombination rate 2.5 S.D greater than the genome-wide average. For Holstein males, a total of 1361, 1353 and 1365 hotspot regions were identified for allele 5 homozygote, allele 5 heterozygote and non-allele 5 animals, respectively. Consistent with observations in human studies,27 each PRDM9 genotype had its unique hotspot regions (Supplementary Fig. S10). Allele 5 homozygote, allele 5 heterozygote and non-allele 5 genotypes each had 887, 737 and 1, 032 unique hotspot regions, with only 97 hotspot regions shared by all three genotypes. Excluding the 97 hotspot regions that were shared by all three genotypes, allele 5 and non-allele 5 had only 47 hotspot regions in common. Consistent with the patterns observed in the global recombination maps, allele 5 heterozygote shared more hotspot regions with allele 5 homozygote than with non-allele 5 genotype (330 vs 189), indicating an observed dominant effect of allele 5. A similar pattern was found in the Holstein cows (Supplementary Fig. S10). Allele 5 homozygote, allele 5 heterozygote and non-allele 5 genotypes each had 801, 583 and 855 allele-specific hotspot regions, with 101 hotspot regions shared across all three genotypes. Excluding the common hotspots, allele 5 homozygote and allele 5 heterozygote genotypes shared 314 hotspot regions, but allele 5 heterozygote and non-allele 5 genotypes had only 260 hotspot regions in common. Using a correlation analysis of recombination rates across three PRDM9 genotypes and two sexes, we found higher correlations between allele 5 homozygote and heterozygote than between allele 5 heterozygote and non-allele 5 in both males and females (Supplementary Fig. S11), confirming the observed dominant effect of allele 5 to other PRDM9 alleles.3.6. Enrichment of PRDM9 binding motifs in recombination hotspot regionsUsing a computational approach designed for ZnF proteins,45 we predicted the binding motifs of the PRDM9 alleles (Supplementary Fig. S6). Since the predicted motifs are almost the same for alleles 1–4, we evaluated the enrichment of PRDM9 binding motifs in recombination hotspot regions by focusing on allele 1 and allele 5. Based on the position weight matrices of the predicted motifs, we extracted the degenerated 17-bp motifs ‘ANNANNANNANNANGGC’ and ‘CGNNANNAGCANNANNA’ for allele 1 and allele 5, respectively. Here, we used allele 1 to represent non-allele 5 alleles because allele 1 was the most frequent and there was little difference in binding motif between allele 1 and other non-allele 5 alleles. In the whole bovine reference genome (UMD 3.1.1), allele 5 motif is 1.17 times more prevalent than allele 1 motif. Compared to this genome-wide baseline ratio of 1.17, non-allele 5 hotspot regions had a decreased ratio of 1.14, and allele 5 hotspot regions had an increased ratio of 1.20 in Holstein males (Supplementary Table S7). When measured in various subsets of hotspot regions, this ratio showed a consistent trend, 1.14 in non-allele 5 and allele 5 heterozygous shared hotspot regions, 1.19 in allele 5 homozygous and allele 5 heterozygous shared hotspot regions, 1.14 in non-allele 5 specific hotspot regions, and 1.21 in allele 5 specific hotspot regions. Similar enrichment trends were observed in females (Supplementary Table S7). Collectively, although we used computationally predicted motifs and our hotspot regions were larger than typical recombination hotspot regions, we did observe an expected trend that allele 5 motif was enriched in allele 5 hotspot regions and allele 1 motif enriched in non-allele 5 hotspot regions.3.7. Comparison of recombination maps from single sperm-typing and pedigree dataThe large pedigree and widely used artificial insemination in cattle provided an opportunity to compare recombination patterns between sperms and live-born offspring. To check the consistency of the recombination patterns inferred from pedigree data, we characterized the recombination patterns of a single Holstein bull using both pedigree and single sperm-typing. The comparison involved 56 high-quality single sperms genotyped on BovineHD (770 K) SNP chip and 556 live-born offspring genotyped with various chips of more than 50 K SNPs (see Materials and methods). Using the same approach of pedigree analysis, we calculated recombination rates in single sperm data between adjacent SNPs on a 50 K SNP chip, so the two recombination maps could be compared with the same number of SNPs. Although sperm data have more SNPs than pedigree data to begin with, the sperm-based recombination map supported the differences between different PRDM9 alleles identified from pedigree data (Supplementary Fig. S12). Overall, recombination rates from the single sperm data (allele1/allele2) showed the highest correlation with the pedigree-based rates from the same bull, and this correlation continuously decreased with recombination maps from animals carrying zero, one and two copies of allele 5 (Supplementary Fig. S12a). As expected, the sperm recombination rates are more similar to male recombination rates than that of females in all groups. In addition, we observed the same trend using the sharing of top 5% recombination intervals between sperm and pedigree data (Supplementary Fig. S12b).By comparing recombination maps from sperms and pedigree of the same bull, we found the same number but slightly different preferred locations of recombination between sperms and live-born offspring. At the chromosome level, the number of crossovers from pedigree and sperm data were correlated with r = 0.77 across 29 autosomes (Supplementary Fig. S13). Since the sperm data had a higher density of SNPs, we manually decreased the SNP number of sperm data to levels comparable to pedigree data. When using similar numbers of SNPs in both samples (10 K in sperms and 7 K–50 K in pedigree), we saw no difference in the total number of recombination events: 21.91 ± 0.5 SE (±3.8 SD) in sperms and 21.65 ± 0.12 SE (±3.8 SD) in pedigree data (Supplementary Fig. S14). To compare the patterns of recombination in pedigree and sperm data, we generated global recombination maps by collapsing all 29 autosomes into a standardized chromosome (Fig. 4). Overall, the pedigree and sperm recombination maps showed a very similar pattern except near the two ends of chromosomes (standardized locations 10%–20% and >80% on a chromosome). At the beginning of a chromosome (10%–20%), the pedigree-based map exhibited a higher recombination rate than the sperm-based map. To the end of a chromosome (>80%), the recombination rate of sperms reached a peak near the 85% of a chromosome, whereas the pedigree-based recombination rate continuously increased to the end of chromosomes. To avoid potential biases from SNP coverage in sperms, we checked the distribution of SNP numbers along the genome and found no clear deficiency of SNPs to the two ends of chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S15). However, a <U+03C7>2 test found no significant differences (P > 0.05) at both locations, possibly due to the small number of sperms tested.

DiscussionThe purpose of this study was to characterize PRDM9 allele-specific localizations of meiotic recombination in widely commercialized cattle breeds.20,21 Meiotic recombination is known to enhance genetic and phenotypic variations in sexually reproducing organisms, and PRDM9 regulates the location of double-stranded breaks and thus recombination events in most of the placental mammals.6,7 Recent studies in humans showed that the PRDM9 alleles have dramatic influences on the localization and turnover of the recombination hotspot via increased sequence diversity;27,46 however, it is unclear whether these patterns can also be observed in cattle, which has unique demographic histories and more importantly, persistently succumbed to intense selective pressures in the past 10,000 years after domestication. In addition, multiple recent GWAS studies have identified candidate genes associated with recombination features in cattle, including PRDM9.31,34,47 The present study not only identified the PRDM9 allele-specific variations including the amino acid substitutions at three functionally important sites (i.e., -1, 3, and 6) of the ZnFs but also provided strong evidence of allele-specific localizations of recombination events with most pronounced differences at the two ends of chromosomes in cattle. Importantly, these evidence suggested a specific allele (allele 5) as the causal variant for the PRDM9 association with cattle recombination.While four out of five PRDM9 alleles were shared between the two cattle breeds and showed similar global recombination patterns, one allele (allele 5) that was unique to Holstein exhibited the highest recombination rates at two recombination peak regions. Interestingly, this pattern is correlated with the observed amino acid substitutions at the functional sites of the PRDM9 ZnFs. In addition, previous studies have reported strong associations between the allele-specific localization and turnover of recombination hotspot regions and the polymorphisms of PRDM9 in humans.8,27,46 Although the diversity levels in PRDM9 alleles and number of ZnF repeats were relatively lower in cattle than primates and rodents,10,11 alleles with unique amino acid substitutions appeared to have dramatic differences in the binding-specificity and the distribution of recombination events. For instance, as observed in this study, animals that carry allele 5 have unique recombination hotspot regions that are distinguishable from hotspot regions modulated by non-allele 5, consistent with studies in humans.27,46 As the PRDM9 ZnFs were predicted to bind sequence motifs that are enriched in recombination hotspot,48,49 one might speculate uneven distributions of binding affinities of the PRDM9 alleles across the cattle genome. Computationally, we predicted two17-bp motifs ‘CGNNANNAGNANNANNA’ and ‘ANNANNANNANNANGGC’ of the most common allele (i.e. allele 1) and allele 5, respectively. We also reported consistent enrichment patterns of these binding motifs in corresponding recombination hotspot regions. Collectively, these variations in PRDM9 ZnFs are associated with the location and intensity of recombination in cattle. However, due to the limited resolution of SNP densities, the strength of enrichment is relatively low and the predicted binding motifs need to be further validated in future experiments.Given the fact that sampling and genotype errors may potentially bias the pedigree-based results, we further confirmed our findings using a single-sperm genomics approach.36,38 Although the genome-wide recombination rates from these two approaches were consistent, we found some differences, especially at the two locations of recombination peaks, between the pedigree and sperm-based recombination maps. These findings were in agreement with the previous studies in humans, which showed that although the recombination maps from the pedigree and sperm-typing methods are largely consistent, considerable differences were observed at a higher resolution. Since the sperms used in the present study were active and viable, the differences in fitness before fertilization are small between the sperm samples and the sperms that ended up in live-born offspring. However, different fitness between sperms and live-born offspring may still lie in the selection process between sperm-egg fertilization and embryo development till birth. Although it is intuitively unclear as to what factors drive such differences, based on our results and previous reports,40 we postulate the differences in sperm fitness during and after fertilization to be one of the plausible explanations.5. ConclusionsTaken together, in this study, we characterized the PRDM9 sequence diversity in multiple cattle breeds and generated PRDM9 allele-specific global and local recombination maps in individual bulls. The large cattle pedigree provided us the power to show differences in genome-wide recombination maps of PRDM9 alleles. For the first time, we showed the impact of PRDM9 on the global distribution of recombination on the genome, particularly in the telomere and centromere regions. Using genome-wide single sperm genotyping, we validated the quality of pedigree-based recombination maps. Collectively, these results will provide new insights into the regulatory functions of PRDM9 on meiotic recombination, which further contribute to our understanding of genome evolution in mammals.DeclarationsEthics approval and consent to participateThe need for ethics approval was waived as the current study didn’t involve whole animals.Consent for publicationNot applicable.Availability of data and materialThe data that support the results of this research are available within the article and its Supplementary Information files.

IntroductionAll living cells share the ability to translate mRNA transcripts into proteins. The codes related to this process partially appear in different regions of the transcript including the UTRs and the coding region. For example, it was shown that the mRNA folding at the 5'UTR and the 5'end of the coding region regulates translation initiation efficiency.1,2 In prokaryotes, translation efficiency is related to the hybridization of the ribosomal RNA and the ribosome biding sites upstream of the start codon.3 It was also shown that different codons have different decoding rate; thus, codon usage biase regulate translation elongation.4–6 In addition, it was shown that there is high concentration of functional silent codes related to various gene expression steps at the 5'end of the coding regions.7Thus, having the ability to harness the nucleotide composition of the transcript to the biophysical dynamics of mRNA translation should have fundamental contribution to disciplines such as molecular evolution, functional genomics, synthetic biology, biotechnology, and human health.8–13Yet, similar to other cellular processes, despite decades of study and various technological advancements, it is still very challenging to predict the dynamics of mRNA translation based only on the transcript nucleotide composition. Specifically, today there are biophysical predictive models that consider mostly translation elongation14–18 or translation initiation.19–22 In addition, there are machine learning based models that statistically integrate various features of the 5'UTR and the coding region to predict gene expression measurements such as protein levels.23–25 However, there is no complete user-friendly model/toolkit, which incorporates both translation initiation and elongation dynamics, based only on the transcript nucleotide composition.In this study, we make an additional step towards developing a computational biophysical model that predicts the dynamics of translation based solely on the transcript nucleotide composition. As we show, the model is specifically important as it enables, for the first time, to study the relation between transcript mutations and the biophysics/dynamics of translation. Translation is a fundamental intracellular process directly related to organismal fitness; thus, we provide an approach that should promote improved and novel understanding of transcript evolution at a nucleotide resolution. We specifically demonstrate how our new model can provide important, and previously unpredicted, information.2. Materials and methodsThe research scheme is shown in Fig. 1: Using the mRNA sequence, the mRNA folding and mRNA-rRNA interactions are calculated, resulting in the relevant Gibbs free energy predicted values (A). These free energy terms are described in the translation initiation efficiency calculator subsection and are then used to predict the initiation rates (B); which is the rate by which ribosomes approach the start codon. The codon translation elongation rates (C) are calculated using ribosome profiling data; each codon has its own elongation rate and when we later refer to the elongation rate of a gene, we consider the elongation rates of all its codons and the dynamic of the translation process (see Section 5). Rather than using a mean field approximation of the model totally asymmetric exclusion process (TASEP)16 such as the ribosome flow model,14 we decided to directly use the stochastic ‘high resolution’ TASEP model to simulate translation using the estimated initiation rates and elongation rates (D). TASEP provides the predictions of translation rate (which is the overall translation rate when considering both the initiation and the elongation steps), ribosomal density, termination counts and occurrences of ribosome jamming (E). Finally, we study various novel questions related to the relations between nucleotide composition of the transcript and translation aspects (F). (A) Based on the 5’UTR and the beginning of the ORF, the Gibbs free energy is calculated. (B) Summing together the free energies results with the expected initiation rate. (C) Using codon translation times and the mRNA ORF, the per-codon elongation rate is calculated. (D) TASEP calculation is performed using the initiation rates and elongation rates from the previous steps. (E) TASEP results with translation rate, ribosomal density, termination count and ribosome jamming. (F) We study the relation between transcript nucleotide composition and translation based on the simulation results.

Normalizing initiation rate5. Modelling translation elongationThe elongation modeling was based on a TASEP.14,16 The TASEP is a stochastic flow model of translation elongation, whose output is the predicted translation rate, the ribosomal density and the number of termination events. An mRNA transcript with N codons is modeled as a chain of sites, each of which is labeled by the index i<U+2060>, where i=1…N<U+2060>. The first and last codons i=1 and i=N<U+2060>, are associated with the start and stop codons, respectively. At any time t<U+2060>, M(t) ribosomes are bound to the mRNA.The initiation time as well as the time a ribosome spends translating each codon are exponentially distributed with a codon dependent rate. In addition, ribosomes span over l codons and if two ribosomes are adjacent, the trailing one is delayed until the ribosome in front of it has proceeded onwards. Unless otherwise specified, all the reported results in this paper use l=11<U+2060>. A free ribosome will attach to codon i=1 with mean rate <U+03BB><U+2060>, if the first (l+1)/2 codons on the mRNA are empty. An attached ribosome located at codon i will move to the next codon i+1 with mean rate <U+03BB>i<U+2060>, provided codon i+(l+1)/2 is not covered by another ribosome. In case i+(l+1)/2>N (ribosome is bulging out of the mRNA strand) an attached ribosome will move to the next codon with mean rate <U+03BB>i<U+2060>. In the case of i=N the jump attempt is in fact a termination step.6. TASEP elongation rateWe obtained the per-codon E. coli typical decoding time (TDR).31 We calculated the mean TDR of the codons by multiplying each codon TDR by the empirical probability of the codon to appear in the entire sequence data (sequence data source is described in E. coli Sequence Data subsection below). We then normalized the mean TDR to be 8 codons per second.32We estimate the elongation rate for each transcript by calculating TASEP with a constant initiation rate. We chose the mean normalized initiation rate (0.2884) to be this constant.7. TASEP traffic jamsA ribosome can only move if the ribosome ahead of it does not cover the next codon. During the simulation, we choose to either attempt initiation or, based on the existing ribosomes, perform translation and move a ribosome to the next position. In cases where such movement cannot occur, we consider this event as a traffic jam. If the simulation attempts initiation, but cannot, since the first (l+1)/2 codons are not empty, we count this as ‘initiation jam occurrence’ and we measure the total time difference between the failed initiation attempt and the next time an initiation is successfully performed as ‘initiation jam time’. If the simulation attempts to move a ribosome to site i<U+2060>, but cannot—since the next (l+1)/2 codons are not empty, we count this as ‘jam occurrence’. We then ensure that a ribosome would move at the same time the subsequent ribosome clears the next (l+1)/2 codon sites, i.e. when it is possible for ribosome to proceed. We also measure the mean time the delayed ribosome had to wait as ‘mean jam time’.8. Data8.1. Escherichia coli sequence dataWe took E. coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 mRNA sequences, including 5'UTR and ORF annotations from RegulonDB version 9.1 (http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx).33 The two files, UTR_5_3_sequence.txt and Gene_sequence.txt, were downloaded directly from the Downloadable Experimental Datasets web page on 31 July 2016.For our analysis of the initiation and translation rates, we chose either operons with a single gene or the first gene in operons that contain multiple genes. Overall, we found 1,500 genes with 2,035 unique 5'UTR and ORF sequences. For some of these transcripts, we could not calculate initiation rate (either the start codon is not ATG, CTG, GTG, or TTG or we did not find a suitable ribosome-binding site); after eliminating those, we were left with 1,904 transcripts. Finally, the initiation calculation sometimes reaches non-feasible initiation time (e.g. millions seconds); thus, to remove extreme outliers we discarded the transcripts with top 50 initiation times from our analysis. Out of the transcripts left, we took only those whose initiation time was lower or equal to 5 times standard deviation away from the initiation time median. Thus, we were left with 1,835 transcripts. Additional details regarding the transcripts discarded from the analysis are available in the supplementary material and Supplementary Table S2.Unless otherwise specified, the results in this paper are calculated per transcript. When comparing the model results with per-gene expression levels, we used the mean results across the different transcripts for the same gene, prior to calculating the correlation.8.2. Escherichia coli protein abundanceThe E. coli str. K-12 substr. MG1655 protein abundance (PA) integrated dataset, a weighted average of all E. coli datasets, published in 2015, was downloaded from PaxDB,34 accessed on 7 May 2016. We excluded any gene with zero reads. Note that similar conclusions were obtained when we analyzed different databases separately (refer to supplementary material for more details).8.3. Escherichia coli mean mRNA levelsThe mean mRNA levels were obtained from Taniguchi et al.35 Data include mean mRNA levels and mRNA levels per cell cycle.8.4. Escherichia coli protein per mRNA levelsWe used the protein abundance, described above and divided it by the corresponding mean mRNA levels, described in the previous subsection to calculate the protein abundance per mean mRNA.8.5. Escherichia coli ribo-seqTwo ribosomal profiling datasets were obtained from the Gene Expression Omnibus: GSE35641, E. coli MG1655 rep1-2.36 Transcript sequences were obtained from EnsEMBL for E. coli (K-12 MG1655 release 121, accessed 28 July 2015). We trimmed 3' adaptors from the reads using Cutadapt37 version 1.8.3, and utilized Bowtie38 version 1.1.1 to map them to the E. coli transcriptome. In the first phase, we discarded reads that mapped to rRNA and tRNA sequences with Bowtie parameters ‘-n 2-seedlen 21-k 1–norc’. In the second phase, we mapped the remaining reads to the transcriptome with Bowtie parameters ‘-v 2 -a –strata –best –norc -m 200’. We filtered out reads longer than 34 nt and shorter than 26 nt. Unique alignments were first assigned to the ribosome occupancy profiles. For reads that are mapped to more than one position, the best alignments in terms of number of mismatches were kept. Then, multiple aligned reads were distributed between locations according to the distribution of unique ribosomal reads in the respective surrounding regions. To this end, for each position i<U+2060>, a 100 nt window was used to compute the read count density RCDi (total read counts in the window divided by length, based on unique reads) in vicinity of the M multiple aligned positions in the transcriptome, and the fraction of a read assigned to each position was RCDi/<U+2211>j=1MRCDj<U+2060>.8.6. Functional annotationWe performed functional annotation of specific groups of genes using DAVID bioinformatics resources version 6.7 (https://david.ncifcrf.gov/).39,40 We set the background list to be the genes in the selected dataset, as described in the E. coli Sequence Data subsection.8.7. Simulating single-nucleotide mutationsFor each transcript in our selected dataset, we simulate a single nucleotide mutation in the range of - 35 to - 1 and +3 to +34 (where 0 is the first nucleotide in the ORF). We excluded the start codon change, as most mutations would result with an invalid start codon. Furthermore, mutations that introduced premature STOP codons were not allowed.8.8. Correction for multiple comparisonsThe enrichment analysis P-values were for multiple comparisons using Bonferroni correction. All the correlation P-values pass Benjamini and Hochberg correction for false discovery rate.9. Results9.1. A toolkit to estimate translation dynamics of transcriptsWe created a software tool that enables the estimation of the initiation rate and translation rate, as well as the sequence features affecting those rates, such as folding energies, ribosome binding efficiencies, and elongation rate. The tool is executed via command line interface, where one should provide either a single mRNA sequence or a list of different mRNA sequences and execution parameters via an input file.Special attention was given to optimize the code, thus allowing almost immediate results for a single mRNA calculation and performing large-scale calculations within reasonable computational time.We named the toolkit Translation Simulator, or Transim, and it is available to download for academic use at the authors’ website—http://www.cs.tau.ac.il/~tamirtul/transim.9.2. Higher correlation of predicted translation rate with experimental measurements than the correlation of predicted initiation rate with experimental measurements in endogenous genesAs a first step, we aimed at checking how well our biophysical model, and different components of the model, can predict measured (i.e. ‘true’) gene expression levels. Today, there are no direct large-scale measurements of translation (measurements of protein levels or mRNA levels, e.g. are related to the transcription step, and the mRNA degradation step; protein levels are related also to the protein degradation step). Thus, we used the measure most correlated/related to translation rate that is available today, protein abundance (PA) divided by mRNA levels which is the estimation of the number of proteins generated per mRNA molecule.We calculated Spearman correlation of protein abundance (PA) divided by mRNA levels (protein per mRNA) with the calculated initiation rates, elongation rates and translation rates. As can be seen in Fig. 2, the correlation with the translation rate was higher and more significant than that with the initiation rate and elongation rate alone. In addition, the partial correlation of translation with PA divided by mRNA given the initiation or the elongation is significant: R(translation, PA/mRNA | initiation) = 0.265, (P = 4.23×10-7), R(translation, PA/mRNA | elongation) = 0.1932 (P = 2.55×10-4). These results support the usage of the complete model (which includes both the initiation and the elongation steps).

About the distributions of initiation rates, elongation rates, and translation ratesIt is worth noting that the distribution of the translation rate is different from the initiation rate and elongation rate, as seen in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S11. Specifically, all distributions are not normal (KStest P-value < 10-10 for initiation and translation and P-value is 5.86×·10-6 for elongation) with positive skewness of 6 and 6.6 for initiation and translation, respectively due to right tails, and small negative skewness (-1.28) for elongation. The positive skewness of the initiation and translation may be related to traffic jams and/or extremely low initiations rate in some genes at the initiation step (extreme and unexpected delays in the initiation times contribute to very high and non-typical initiation times, resulting in the right tail).18The distribution of various translation variables: initiation rates (A), elongation rates (B), ribosome densities (C), translation rates (D), translation rate to initiation rate ratio (E). Note that the bin sizes are not uniform, but grow exponentially.The distribution of various translation variables: initiation rates (A), elongation rates (B), ribosome densities (C), translation rates (D), translation rate to initiation rate ratio (E). Note that the bin sizes are not uniform, but grow exponentially.As can be seen (Fig. 3), the mean initiation time per transcript is 54.4 s while the mean elongation time is 138.1 s and the mean translation time is 174.2 s. This is expected, as translation includes both initiation and elongation. While there are cases with very low initiation time (the minimum is 0.04 s), the minimum elongation and translation times are 96.3 and 98.6 s, respectively. In the cases where initiation rates are very fast, we would expect elongation to be the rate-limiting factor. We also see the maximum initiation time found is 1,629 s, while the maximum translation time is 1,739.7 s. The maximum elongation time is 155.3 s, but 80% of the initiation rates are below 52.2 s and 80% of the translation rates are below 155.7 s and we expect the initiation to be rate-limiting factor when it is slow.The fact that the typical initiation rate is significantly lower than the typical translation rate demonstrates that, in practice, not only the initiation step affects translation rate but that also the elongation rate tcontributes to the final translation rate;7,42 this insight provides a better understanding to previous models in the field.43While translation rate can be significantly affected by the initiation rate, fast initiation rates (i.e. low initiation time), can increase the translation rate, but up to a point. In these cases, the elongation rate becomes a limiting factor, effectively creating a maximum threshold for the translation rate. This limit in translation rate may be important for biological processes, such as prevention of depletion of the ribosome pool. Hence, genes that have high and efficient initiation rate may have codons that partially limit their overall translation rate and ribosome consumption.7 Limiting the translation elongation rate may also assist in allowing the resultant protein to cotranslationally fold correctly.44–48The results reported here suggest that changes in the codon composition of a gene should have significant effect on translation, even if the initiation rate is optimal/maximal and this can be further validated experimentally via the design of relevant libraries of gene variants and the measurements of translation of the different variants.9.4. Only specific locations of single nucleotide mutation affect initiation and translation ratesAt the next step, we aimed at understanding the effect of mutations in different regions surrounding the start codon on translation rate in endogenous transcripts. This was done under the assumption that the expression levels of each transcript is not extremely high such that the mutations should not affect the translation rate of other transcripts.49 Thus, for each transcript in our dataset and each nucleotide in the range of -35 to -1 and +3 to +34 (where 0 is the first nucleotide of the ORF), we changed the actual nucleotide to all three other possible nucleotides. We then calculated the new initiation rate and translation rate per each change. For each position, we calculated the mean result and compared it to the mean of the unmodified transcript.Results are available in Fig. 4. On average, there is a clear reduction in initiation rate when mutations occur at the RBS site (which is generally 5–13 nucleotides upstream of the start codon, with a typical distance of about 8–10 bases relative to the start codon),50–52 although the translation rate is less affected. Apart from the RBS site, changes in the first nucleotides of the ORF also tend to slightly decrease mean initiation rate. When we examine this in more detail (Supplementary Figs S1–S4), while we still see the same effect in the RBS site, we also see that for translation, only a small group of transcripts had an increase in translation rate, and some had a decrease, but for most transcripts, no change occurred in translation rate. For initiation, we also see several groups, and a large portion remains unchanged. These results demonstrate that translation rate tend to be immune to single point mutations in the transcript. We also see slight increase in codon rate in that region due to the mutation, this occurs since codons are usually ‘less optimal’ (in terms of their translation rate) in the beginning of the ORF.7Impact of single single nucleotide mutation on the mean initiation rate, the mean change in codon decoding rate for the position where the mutation occurs, and the mean translation rate.Impact of single single nucleotide mutation on the mean initiation rate, the mean change in codon decoding rate for the position where the mutation occurs, and the mean translation rate.The fact that the most prominent effect is seen in the RBS site is in agreement with previous studies, which have demonstrated that mutations in the Shine-Delgarno regions have the strongest effect on translation rate.53,54 This could be further validated in large-scale experiments in the future.We further examined the impact of mutation type on the initiation rate (Supplementary Fig. S10). The type of mutation tends to have significant position-based effect most prominent in the RBS: G to C and G to T seem to decrease the initiation rate while the inverse mutation C to G and T to G have the opposite effect and tend to increase the initiation rate in that region. This inverse effect does not always exist, for example, G to A tends to reduce the initiation rate, but A to G tends to have an almost neutral effect. It is likely these changes in the initiation rate are due to changes in the ribosome binding to the mRNA, since the mutation can change the binding site to be closer or farther from the Shine-Delgarno sequence.The result reported here provides an estimation of different type of mutations in different regions surrounding the start codon on translation. This estimation can be further validated experimentally via the design of relevant libraries of gene variants and the measurements of translation of the different variants.9.5. Correlation between initiation rate, elongation rate, ribosome density, and translation rateNext, we aimed at understanding the relations between initiation rate, elongation rate, ribosome density and translation rate in endogenous transcripts. Thus, we calculated the Spearman correlation between these values. The results are shown in Table 1. Spearman correlation between initiation rate, elongation rate, ribosome density, and translation rateThe values in parenthesis indicate the respective P-value (all P-values pass correction for false discovery rate).Spearman correlation between initiation rate, elongation rate, ribosome density, and translation rateThe values in parenthesis indicate the respective P-value (all P-values pass correction for false discovery rate).We can see weak correlation between elongation rate and initiation rate and strong relationship between initiation rate and ribosome density. We also find that translation rate is highly correlated with all three other measurements. Please note that mathematically there can be cases where some of these correlations do not exist (refer to the supplementary material for more details). In endogenous/real sequences, a correlation can be explained by the fact that the translation process depends on ribosome initiation and elongation; in addition, sequences with high translation rates will require more ribosomes in average (due to higher initiation rate). The magnitude of the correlation, provided here for the first time, allows estimation of the relative ‘contribution’ of initiation and elongation to translation rate variability in endogenous/real transcripts. In general, when increasing the initiation rate while keeping the elongation rate constant, we expect to see an increase in ribosome density (as more ribosomes are ‘pumped’ into the coding region). Higher elongation rate, for a constant initiation rate, is expected to decrease the ribosome density (as it corresponds to faster removal of ribosomes from the coding region); indeed the partial Spearman correlation between translation elongation and ribosome density when controlling for the initiation rate relongation, densityinitiation is negative (r = -0.044; P-value is borderline significant 0.0597). Increase in initiation and elongation rates (when they are rate limiting) is expected to correspond to an increase in the translation rate. Our analysis demonstrates that genes that tend to have increased/higher initiation rate tend to also have higher elongation rate; the increase in initiation rate in highly expressed genes is more ‘dominant’ in terms of the effect on ribosome density as the correlation between translation rate/protein levels and ribosome density is positive. This supports the approach of various studies that measure translation efficiency via measurements that are related to ribosome density.55It should be interesting to study in the future other organisms to see if the positive relation between initiation and elongation rate vs. ribosome density is universal.9.6. Traffic jams study in different gene groups and the way they are effected by mutationsOne advantage of our model is the fact that it provides estimations related to variables such as ribosome collisions/traffic jams that cannot be accurately predicted based on models that estimate only the initiation or only the elongation. For native/endogenous transcripts, we see that most of the jam time can be attributed to the initiation step: across all transcripts, the mean time for initiation jamming is 8.7% of the total initiation time, while for the elongation jam time, the mean is up to 2.4% of the total time (Fig. 5). Furthermore, the maximum initiation jam time over all gene is 96.9% of the total initiation time, whereas the maximum elongation jam time at a codon is at most 8%. When we measure the mean elongation jam time across all codons, we see the mean is almost 20% out of the elongation time and for 25% of the genes this value is above 27%. The fraction of time ribosome jam occurs for initiation, on start codon, and mean jam time across the entire ORF. Note that the bin sizes are not uniform but grow exponentially.The fraction of time ribosome jam occurs for initiation, on start codon, and mean jam time across the entire ORF. Note that the bin sizes are not uniform but grow exponentially.In addition, the Spearman correlation between initiation rate and initiation jam time is 0.72 (P-value = 3.61×10-293<U+2060>) and between initiation rate and mean elongation jam time it is 0.39 (P-value = 1.7×10-69<U+2060>). The correlation between translation rate and initiation jam time is 0.56 and with mean elongation jam time it is 0.54 (P-value < 2.2×10-308<U+2060>).At the next step, we analyzed the effect of mutations on jamming (Supplementary Figs S5–S8). We found that the initiation jam time relative change has significantly high correlation with the initiation rate, where for the same position a change occurs—a similar number of transcripts decrease or increase in the same magnitude. We determined that the correlation between the relative change of initiation rate and initiation jam time is 0.93 (P-value < 2.2×10-308<U+2060>). If we check the same correlation per each mutation position, the minimum correlation is 0.738, and if we exclude the two extreme mutation positions, we see the minimum correlation is 0.856 and a total of 61 out of 67 position have a correlation of above 0.9 (all P-values are lower than 2.2×10-308<U+2060>). While we have seen in previous sections that translation rate was mostly unaffected by single nucleotide mutations, there is greater impact on the jam time during elongation. This change may indeed further propagate towards changes in initiation rate and initiation jam time, as a change in jam time during elongation may free or occupy codons at the beginning of the ORF, depending on whether the jam time decreased or increased.Previous studies have shown that a conserved region (codons 18–50) exists where the codons tend to be slower.7,56 It was previously suggested that both slower initiation and slower elongation rates at the beginning of the coding region should contribute (independently) to decreased jamming.7,56 To examine this, we performed the following simulation: first, we changed the codons at positions 18–50 to be the fastest synonymous codons; as a result, the mean traffic jam increased by 6.2%. This value is very significant since increase in traffic jams/ribosome-density should be proportional to the decrease in the number of free ribosomes, which consequently affects the organism growth rate.49 The effect was even higher when we changed the codons in positions 51–100 to be the slowest (Traffic jam increased by 25.2%) or when we changed all codons downstream the first 50 codons to be slowest (Traffic jam increased by 68.2%).In this sub-section, we provide some estimation of traffic jams and the effect of codon distribution/bias on traffic jams. These estimation and relations can further validated experimentally via the design of relevant libraries of gene variants and the measurements of the profile or ribosome densities (e.g. using ribo-seq) of the different variants.9.7. Genes with relatively extreme translation initiation and translation elongation rateOur model enables recognizing and studying groups of genes with unique translation features. In this subsection, we demonstrate this via the analyses of various group of genes with extreme translation elongation and initiation levels.We first considered the group of genes with high initiation rate but with relatively low elongation rate. These genes are interesting because, in general, there is a positive correlation between translation initiation and elongation (see previous sections). Relative slower elongation for these genes may be related to additional constraints such as co-translational folding.57 We found 16 genes to be in the top 10% of the initiation rate and the bottom 10% of the elongation rate. When we raised the threshold to 20%, we found 63 genes (see Supplementary Table S1) and 267 genes were found with a threshold of 40%. Using functional annotation (Gene Ontology: GO; http://www.geneontology.org) we found that, among others, the latest group of genes includes 37 genes that are related to organelle inner membrane (GO: 0019866; P-value = 6.84×10-19<U+2060>; all the P-values reported in this section were adjusted for multiple comparison—see the Methods section) and 57 genes that are related to ‘plasma membrane’ (GO: 0005886; P-value = 6.84×10-9<U+2060>).One explanation for these results may be related to the suggestion that membrane proteins undergo various maturation aspects during the elongation step which requires slower elongation (while the initiation may remain efficient).7,58–60The second gene group we study includes genes with relatively low initiation rate (bottom 40%) and high elongation rate (40%). We found 170 such genes (see Supplementary Table S1); the group was enriched with genes relate to purine nucleotide biosynthetic process (GO: 0006164/ecx00230; P = 2.52 × 10-3) and genes related to translation/ribosome (GO: 0006412; P = 0.03). It is possible that these are highly expressed genes with constraints on the nucleotide composition near the start codon that effect the evolution of and optimality of their initiation (e.g. due to specific amino acids at the 5'end or signals related to transcription); it is also possible that some of them have non-canonical initiation regulation.The third gene group we study includes genes with relatively high initiation rate (bottom 40%) and high elongation rate (40%). We found 228 such genes (see Supplementary Table S1); this group, naturally, includes highly expressed genes and enriched with housekeeping gene groups/functions such as amino acid metabolism (e.g. GO: 0008652 with P = 1.44 × 10-5) translation/ribosome (e.g. GO: 0003735 with P = 7.25 × 10-6), protein folding/chaperone (GO: 0006457 with P = 0.0067).The groups of genes described here can be further experimentally studied in the future, by introducing silent mutations into the coding sequences and the UTRs of these genes and examining their effect on the improvement of translation rate, the functionality of the related proteins, and the organism fitness.9.8. Mutations with reciprocal effect on initiation and elongationIn this section we aimed at further demonstrating how the new model can answer new important questions related to the effect on transcript evolution and mRNA translation regulation and biophysics. The (non intuitive) reciprocal effect of mutations on elongation and initiation in different regions is a simple example of such a question which was already discussed in the past7 but with no clear quantitative analyses.Thus, mutations causing reciprocal effect in initiation and elongation are of interest, given that we naturally see/expect significant correlation between elongation and initiation rate. To study these types of mutations, for each possible mutation occurring in the beginning of the ORF (positions +3 until +34), we looked for cases where the initiation rate was increased by at least 25%, while the codon translation rate was reduced by at least 25% (which we name ‘type 1 mutations’). We also looked for cases where initiation rate decreased by at least 25% and codon translation rate was increased by 25% (which we name ‘type 2 mutations’). For each of the above cases such occurrence happens in 4.6% of the ORF mutations. More details of per-position changes are available in Supplementary Fig. S9. Interestingly, we found that, on average, in positions 3–17 of the coding region there are higher levels of mutations of type 2. Conversely, there are more occurrences of type 1 mutations in positions 18–34. Using Wilcoxon signed-rank test61 we compared, per each mutation position, the relative initiation rate and the relative codon decoding rate. In about half of the positions within the range of 3 and 17, and in all of the positions in the range of 18–34, we found significant differences. These results demonstrate that many point mutations can have reciprocal effect on initiation and elongation and that the first nucleotides of the coding region tend to be relatively more ‘optimized’ to the translation initiation stage than the elongation stage. Previous studies have suggested that the beginning of the coding sequence includes ‘late initiation’ signals, which are part of the initiation step but encoded in the coding region.7 Our model enables the prediction of the exact boundaries of this region.In this sub-section, we provide estimations of the effect of each nucleotide/region on initiation and elongation. These estimations and relations can be further validated experimentally via the design of relevant libraries of gene variants and the measurements of the profile or ribosome densities (e.g. using ribo-seq) or better performing high resolution tracking of ribosome movements62 over the different variants.10. DiscussionThe model described in this study allows predicting, for the first time, translation dynamics based on the transcript features alone. As we demonstrate here, the model enables performing analyses that were not possible within the framework of previous models (e.g. statistical/machine learning models, or models that consider only the initiation or elongation step). Specifically, we demonstrate how the model can be used for predicting expression levels of endogenous and heterologous genes and predicting various aspects related to the translation dynamics. In addition, the model is very useful for studying the molecular evolution of translation aspects via studying the effect of mutations on translation dynamics.Among others, we demonstrate a close association between changes in initiation rate and jam time during initiation. Within the framework of our model, it is easy to explain such relations, as increase or decrease in initiation rate can directly alter jam time. Within the cell, it is also possible that changes affecting the initiation jam time (such as those occurring in the ORF) can influence the initiation rate. We also demonstrate that mutations at the RBS region have the strongest effect on translation and we show that membrane genes tend to have relatively slower elongation and high initiation. Furthermore, we show that around 4–5% of the mutations near the beginning of the ORF increase initiation rate by at least 25% while decreasing by at least 25% the elongation efficiency. We also find 4–5% of these mutations increase elongation while reducing initiation rate by the same factor. Our analysis provides an estimation of the ratio between translation rate and initiation rate in the E. coli endogenous genes and found that its median is 10.13%. This result further implies that elongation (and the coding region itself) and not only initiation has central effect on the translation rate.It is important to emphasize that this model connects, for the first time, the impact of mutations (possibly silent) in the transcripts with fundamental biophysical phenomena (e.g., ribosome allocation, traffic jams, translation rate, etc.), which are directly related to the organism fitness. Thus, with this model (and additional relevant adjustments), we are able to understand the effect of silent mutations on fitness and thus estimate their corresponding selection pressure; this is an important aspect that should be integrated into any realistic molecular evolution models. While existing models (including non-physical ones such as regressors) may similarly predict the expression levels of endogenous genes,23,25,63 it is important to emphasize that our model’s novel potential to predict the impact of single mutations on initiation and elongation biophysics, as well as other translation aspects, based on the mRNA sequence alone.These results can only be derived from a combined model, such as the one presented here. The model’s application can be downloaded and used in future quantitative studies related to translation in the field.Future work can extend the current model to support wider and more complex aspects of translation. For instance, whole cell simulations, taking into account additional constraints, such as the tRNA pool size and ribosome pool size may provide additional insights. mRNA and protein degradation rates can be incorporated to better correlate mRNA levels with protein abundance, etc.We chose to calculate the initiation rates only for the first gene in each operon. Extending the calculations to genes in other positions of the operon may yield additional interesting results but this requires modifications in the model due to additional possible interactions of the mRNA molecules with itself and with the ribosome.64 Furthermore, although we provide some initial results for B. subtilis (see in the Supplementary material), our analysis focused on E. coli simply since it is the prokaryote with the most abundance relevant large-scale measurements. It is important to emphasize that the model (with some small adjustment) can be used on other prokaryotes and in the future, it will be interesting to comprehensively study other prokaryotes with similar models. In addition, it will be interesting to develop similar model for Eukaryotes and in different tissues; specifically, for this domain currently there is no initiation model while elongation model exists and is relatively similar between the two domains.65Finally, in this work, we assume steady state of the translation process. A more dynamic model, taking into account mRNA folding during ribosomes detachment and mRNA decay rate may result in simulations of higher accuracy and a better understanding of the biophysics of translation.FundingThis research was partially supported by a research grant from the Israeli Ministry of Science, Technology and Space and by a grant from the Ela Kodesz Institute for Medical Physics and Engineering.Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.Supplementary data"

IntroductionAggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans is a Gram-negative facultative anaerobe. It is a major periodontal pathogen that is often associated with aggressive periodontitis.1 Two exotoxins, leukotoxin and cytolethal distending toxin (Cdt), have been reported as the major virulence factors of A. actinomycetemcomitans. Leukotoxin is a membrane-active toxin that specifically kills leukocytes and contributes to the evasion of the host immune response.2 Cdt inhibits the proliferation of host cells, including lymphocytes and gingival fibroblasts, by arresting the cell cycle, and it can also induce apoptosis.3In the past decade, a group of non-coding RNAs known as small RNAs (sRNAs) have been identified as novel regulatory factors of gene expression in various bacteria, including several pathogens.4 The regulatory functions of sRNAs can be categorized into two types: trans-acting and cis-acting. The trans-acting regulation is mediated by sRNAs that are encoded in the intergenic region (IGR) and have been termed IGR sRNAs. Most IGR sRNAs contain a stem–loop structure. Via short, imperfect base paring between the loop and the target RNAs, IGR sRNAs regulate the expression of multiple genes located at several genome positions. Both negative and positive regulations by IGR sRNA have been demonstrated.4 In negative regulation, IGR sRNA base pairs with a ribosome-binding site (RBS) in the target mRNA and inhibits translation by preventing the ribosome from recognizing an mRNA.5 IGR sRNAs can also affect the stability of mRNA by binding to target mRNAs and recruiting endoribonucleases to accelerate the degradation of the target mRNAs.6 Some IGR sRNAs can positively regulate gene expression via translational activation or RNA protection. For example, the Staphylococcus aureus sRNA RNAIII is a global regulator of virulence genes that enhances the translation of alpha-toxin (Hla). The binding of RNAIII to the 5' untranslated region (UTR) of hla mRNA affects the secondary structure of the mRNA, thus enhancing ribosomal access and translation.7 The cis-acting sRNA regulation is mediated by ‘antisense sRNAs (asRNAs)’, which are encoded on the opposite strand of the same loci as the target RNA. Several regulatory mechanisms have been reported for asRNAs including target RNA degradation and translational inhibition.8 For example, the degradation of the isrA mRNA of Synechocystis PCC 6803 is enhanced by the binding of an asRNA (IsiR).9 In the SymE–SymR toxin–antitoxin system of Escherichia coli, the SymR asRNA binds the RBS of symE mRNA and inhibits its translation.10Systematic searches for bacterial sRNAs have recently been performed by using various comprehensive methods such as computational prediction, a tiling array analysis, and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) with high-throughput next generation sequencers.11,12 In E. coli, more than 400 sRNAs have been identified, and some of them have been characterized.13,14 In Pseudomonas aeruginosa, more than 500 sRNAs have been identified by RNA-seq, nearly 90% of which have no orthologues in other bacterial species.15Efforts to identify sRNAs in A. actinomycetemcomitans have also been undertaken. Jorth et al. have used northern blotting to identify 9 sRNAs from 35 sRNA candidates predicted by bioinformatics in strain VT1169.16 The same group has performed a more systematic screening of sRNA by using RNA-seq in strain 624 and has identified 202 sRNAs.17 In strain HK1651, four sRNAs that are expressed under iron-limiting conditions have been identified.18In the present study, we systematically screened sRNAs by RNA-seq to determine the repertoire of sRNAs in A. actinomycetemcomitans strain HK1651, which is a clinical isolate from an aggressive periodontitis patient and a JP2 clonal isolate.19 We subsequently validated the expression of the identified sRNAs by RT-PCR, analysed the distribution of sRNAs in four other A. actinomycetemcomitans strains and determined the expression pattern of the sRNAs during growth.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains and growth conditionsWe analysed five A. actinomycetemcomitans strains: HK1651 (serotype b), ATCC29523 (serotype a), Y4 (serotype b), NCTC9710 (serotype c), and IDH781 (serotype d) in the present study. Of these, the genomes of HK1651 and IDH781 have been sequenced (CP008984.1 and CP016553.1). All strains were grown in Todd Hewitt broth (Becton, Dickinson and Company, Franklin Lakes, NJ, USA) supplemented with 1% (wt/vol) yeast extract (Nacalai Tesque, Kyoto, Japan) (THY broth) at 37°C under 5% CO2 without shaking.2.2. RNA isolationA small aliquot (108 CFU) of an overnight culture of strain HK1651 was inoculated into 30 ml of THY broth and grown to early-exponential phase [optical density at 660 nm (OD660) of 0.1] or late-exponential phase (OD660 of 0.2) (Supplementary Fig. S1). The total RNA was extracted using the acidic phenol method20 with several modifications. Briefly, the bacterial culture was pelleted by centrifugation (3,000 × g for 10 min) and re-suspended in ice-cold resuspension buffer (50 mM sodium acetate, 10 mM magnesium acetate). Total RNA was extracted twice with acidic phenol (saturated with citrate buffer, pH 4.3) extraction, followed by a chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. The sample was treated with TURBOTM DNase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Inc., Waltham, MA, USA) (20 units/ml) to remove the DNA. One microgram of RNA was electrophoresed on a TBE-Urea (9M)-acrylamide (8%) gel and visualized by ethidium bromide staining to confirm the RNA quality. 2.3. RNA-seq analysisRNA-seq was performed on two independently prepared samples from early-exponential phase cells. Sequencing libraries were prepared from each RNA preparation without fragmentation by using the NEBNext® Multiplex Small RNA Library Prep Set for Illumina® (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol, with a minor modification. This kit is specialized for sequencing eukaryotic sRNAs that contain a 5' monophosphate, such as miRNA and siRNA. Therefore, to analyse sRNAs containing a 5' monophosphate terminus or a triphosphate terminus, the total RNA was treated with RNA 5' poly phosphatase (Epicentre, Madison, WI, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions before a sequencing library was prepared (Fig. 1). Paired-end sequencing (2 × 300 bp) was performed on the MiSeq platform (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. After removal of the low-quality reads and trimming of the adaptor sequences using the FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/index.html), the sequence reads were strand-specifically mapped to the HK1651 genome sequence by using the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner,21 and the data were visualized with Integrative Genomics Viewer.22 The sequence reads obtained have been deposited in the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ database (DRA submission number, DRA005568; DRR accession number, DRR088289).

Northern blot analysisTwenty micrograms of total RNA extracted from HK1651 harvested during the early-exponential phases was electrophoresed on a TBE-Urea (9M)-acrylamide (8%) gel. The separated RNA was transferred onto a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) in 20× SSC. The membrane was baked for 2 h at 80°C. After prehybridization using DIG Easy Hyb (Roche Diagnostics), the membrane was hybridized with DIG Easy Hyb containing a 25 pmol of single-stranded DNA probe (Supplementary Table S1) labelled with digoxigenin using DIG Oligonucleotide Tailing Kit, 2nd generation (Roche Diagnostics) for 18 h at 45°C. After hybridization, the membrane was washed and blocked using DIG Wash and Block Buffer Set (Roche Diagnostics), and then the hybridization signals were detected using DIG Luminescent Detection Kit (Roche Diagnostics) and ChemiDoc™ XRS+ (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Inc., Hercules, CA, USA).2.5. RT-PCR and quantitative RT-PCRTotal RNA extracted from five A. actinomycetemcomitans strains (HK1651, ATCC29523, Y4, NCTC9710, and IDH781) harvested during the early- and late-exponential phases was polyadenylated using E. coli poly (A) polymerase (New England Biolabs) at 37°C for 30 min. This was followed by phenol/chloroform extraction and ethanol precipitation. One microgram of the RNA was then converted to cDNA with a Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche Diagnostics) with an oligo d(T) primer containing a sequence tag at the 5'-end (5'-AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTACTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTVN-3'). The cDNA was amplified using FastStart Essential DNA Green Master reaction mix (Roche Diagnostics) with 5'-primers specific to each sRNA and a 3'-primer (5'-CAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT-3') that targeted the previously mentioned sequence tag. The sRNA specific primers are listed in Supplementary Table S2. The specific primers were designed within 50 bp from the 5' terminus of each sRNA to amplify the nearly full-length sRNAs. In cases in which the sRNAs had high homology to other loci, the primers were designed to contain two nucleotide mismatches at the 3' termini to prevent non-specific amplification. The thermal cycling conditions used were a 10-min incubation at 95°C followed by 25–45 cycles of 10 s at 95°C and 30 s at 58–62°C. The number of amplification cycles and the annealing/elongation temperatures were altered according to the amplification efficiency of each sRNA. The RT-PCR products were electrophoresed on a 2% agarose gel and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. Each sRNA was analysed two or three times using independently prepared RNA samples.Quantitative RT-PCR (qPCR) was performed using a LightCycler Nano (Roche Diagnostics) and the same experimental procedures described for the RT-PCR assay (polyadenylation, cDNA conversion, and PCR primers). The transcription level was normalized to 5S rRNA (5'-primer; 5'-TGAAACCATACCGAACTCAG-3') in a 1,000-fold diluted cDNA sample. Each sRNA was analysed by qPCR three times using independently prepared RNA samples. The EZR version 1.32 software (http://www.jichi.ac.jp/saitama-sct/SaitamaHP.files/statmedEN.html) was used for statistical analyses.2.6. Genomic DNA PCRAggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans strains were cultivated in 5 ml of THY broth at 37°C under 5% CO2 without shaking for 24 h. The genomic DNA was extracted using a DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), and 100 ng was used as a template for PCR. PCR was performed using BIOTAQ™ DNA Polymerase (Bioline Reagents Ltd, London, UK) with the 5' primers listed in Supplementary Table S2 and the 3' primers listed in Supplementary Table S3. The 3' primers were designed ~100 bp downstream of the 5' primer for each target genomic region. The thermal cycling conditions were a 2-min incubation at 94°C followed by 30 cycles of 20 s at 94°C, 30 s at 60°C, and 30 s at 72°C. The PCR products were electrophoresed and visualized as described above.2.7. Multilocus sequence analysisSix housekeeping genes (pgi, recA, adk, frdB, atpG, and mdh) were chosen according to a previous study.23 Internal fragments of ~500 bp were amplified by PCR with the primers listed in Supplementary Table S4. PCR was performed using TaKaRa Ex Taq® (TAKARA BIO INC., Kusatsu, Shiga, Japan). The reactions contained genomic DNA (100 ng) that was purified from the three A. actinomycetemcomitans strains (Y4, ATCC29523, and NCTC9710) as described above. The thermal cycling conditions were 2 min of incubation at 94°C followed by 35 cycles of 20 s at 94°C, 30 s at 60°C, and 1 min at 72°C. The PCR products were purified using a Microcon YM-100 (Merck Millipore Corporation, Darmstadt, Germany) and sequenced using a BigDye® Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.) and an ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyser (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc.). The primers used for PCR amplification were used as sequencing primers. The sequences of the six genes (pgi; 514 bp, recA; 480 bp, adk; 432 bp, frdB; 538 bp, atpG; 516 bp, and mdh; 457 bp) were concatenated for each of the three strains, and the corresponding sequences of HK1651 (CP008984.1), IDH781 (CP016553.1), and Aggregatibacter aphrophilus NJ8700 (CP001607.1) were obtained from the GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ database. The concatenated sequences were aligned for a phylogenetic analysis by the maximum likelihood method using MEGA ver. 7.0.21.242.8. Target prediction of sRNAsThe target mRNAs of each IGR sRNA were predicted by IntaRNA,25 using the sequences encompassing 75 bp upstream and downstream of the start codon of each protein coding sequence (CDS), which were extracted from the A. actinomycetemcomitans HK1651 RefSeq sequence (NZ_CP007502.1). The parameters were set to a minimum of seven base pairs in the seed region. We defined the threshold for target prediction at a maximal energy of -14.2 kcal/mol. The maximal energy was the sum of the hybridization free energy of the interacting subsequences and the free energies required to unfold the interaction sites in both RNA molecules.3. Results and discussion3.1. Identification of sRNAs in A. actinomycetemcomitans HK1651The sRNA identification process is shown in Fig. 1. The primary transcripts contained a triphosphate at the 5' terminus, whereas the processed transcripts had a 5' monophosphate. To identify both types of sRNA molecules,26 we converted the 5' triphosphate RNA to a 5' monophosphate RNA and then constructed a library for RNA-seq. Because most known sRNAs are 30–500 nucleotides long, we did not perform RNA fragmentation; thus, large transcripts were ignored. We obtained 1,055,983 (Experiment 1) and 844,585 (Experiment 2) pairs of sequence reads from the RNA-seq analyses of 2 independently prepared RNA samples from early exponentially growing HK1651 cells. Although many reads were derived from the rrn loci (mainly 5S rRNAs), 471,017 (Experiment 1) and 473,797 (experiments 2) read pairs were mapped to non-rrn loci. Using these reads, we searched for sRNAs on the basis of the following criteria: (i) transcribed from IGRs (defined as IGR sRNA) or opposite strands of CDSs (asRNA); (ii) with >50 (Experiment 1) and >40 (Experiment 2) mapping coverage to normalize for the different numbers of sequence reads between 2 samples (1,055,983 and 844,585 reads); and (iii) of identical size in the two samples. In addition, we excluded data with gradually decreased coverage towards the ends of transcripts, to remove false positives derived from degraded RNA. Through these criteria, we identified a total of 120 sRNAs that were 35–386 bp long (Fig. 2A) and broadly distributed throughout the entire chromosome (Fig. 2B). Of the 120 sRNAs, 90 were IGR sRNAs, including two riboswitches and one tmRNA, and 30 were asRNAs (Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). To confirm the expression of the sRNAs, we performed northern blot analysis. We selected 10 sRNAs based on the high expression by RNA-seq results, and found the bands of 10 sRNAs (Fig. 3). Most of their lengths were almost consistent with those of the RNA-seq, but the lengths of AaHKsRNA099 and 103 were slightly different between northern analysis and RNA seq. This difference may be due to the definition of sRNA with our criteria described above. We found that the three sets of IGR sRNAs (AaHKsRNA031 and 032, AaHKsRNA046 and 047, AaHKsRNA063 and 064) were located in both strands and were partially overlapping (Supplementary Table S5). In these cases, it was possible for one of the transcripts to be a protein-encoding mRNA and the other one to be an asRNA, such as in a toxin–antitoxin system.10 However, we did not find a functional CDS in these sRNAs. Many IGR sRNAs have a Rho-independent terminator, which is an important structure for interaction with the RNA chaperone Hfq.27 Therefore, we assessed the presence of Rho-independent terminators in sRNAs by using ARNold (http://rna.igmors.u-psud.fr/toolbox/arnold/) and found 34 Rho-independent terminators in 90 IGR sRNAs (Supplementary Table S5). sRNAs identified in A. actinomycetemcomitans HK1651.

Arrows indicate the predicted sRNAs.We compared our results against the sRNAs identified in previous studies16,–18 and found that 60 of the 90 IGR sRNAs were newly identified. Of the 75 IGR sRNA detected in strain 624 by Jorth et al.17 under various conditions including an in vivo model, 49 were not found in our IGR sRNA set. An analysis of these 49 sRNAs revealed that the sequences corresponding to 19 sRNAs were absent in the HK1651 genome, 8 sRNAs were in CDSs, and 7 were located in repetitive sequences. The 13 IGR sRNAs were detected in our RNA-seq analysis, but their mapping coverage was lower than the study thresholds (below 50 in Experiment 1 and/or below 40 in Experiment 2). No reads were obtained for the remaining two IGR sRNAs in our RNA-seq analysis. Of the four Fur regulated IGR sRNAs (JA01, JA02, JA03, and JA04) identified in strain HK1651,18 only JA04 was identified under our experimental conditions, and no reads were detected for the other three.Of the 30 asRNAs identified in the present study, as many as 29 were newly identified. Although in the previously mentioned study of strain 624, the authors have reported 127 asRNAs,17 only one of these (asRNA corresponding to D7S_0307.1) was identified in the present study (AaHKsRNA084). In addition, the lengths of D7S_0307.1 (1,067 bp) and AaHKsRNA084 (56 bp) differed significantly. Of the remaining 126 asRNAs identified in the previous study, 1 asRNA (D7S_2363.1) showed sequence homology to 2 tRNA genes, and sequences corresponding to 22 asRNAs were absent in the HK1651 genome. Although sequences corresponding to the remaining 103 asRNAs were conserved in the HK1651 genome, the mapping coverage of 29 asRNAs was below the threshold, and no reads were detected for 73 asRNAs in our RNA-seq analysis. A portion of one sRNA reported as an asRNA in strain 624 (D7S_2289.1; 295 bp) corresponded to IGR sRNA020 (77 bp) identified in the present study. Thus, the asRNA set identified in HK651 was significantly different from that of strain 624 (17). Two large asRNAs (D7S_1370.1; 996 bp and D7S_0307.1; 1,624 bp) identified in strain 624 were undetectable in our experimental analysis. A total of 32 asRNAs shorter than 30 bp were identified in strain 624 that were not identified in strain HK1651. Although systematic searches for asRNAs have been performed in several bacterial species,28–30 asRNAs shorter than 30 bp have rarely been reported, including in our study.3.2. Development of RT-PCR to detect sRNA and confirmation of the expression of the sRNAs identified in strain HK1651We attempted to develop an RT-PCR-based, simple detection system for sRNAs to confirm the expression of sRNAs identified by RNA-seq. However, it is impossible to distinguish an asRNA from its cognate mRNA by conventional RT-PCR. It is also difficult to design forward and reverse primers for many IGR sRNAs because of their short lengths. Therefore, we first polyadenylated the RNA molecules, converted them to cDNA by using a tagged oligo d(T) primer, and then detected sRNAs by PCR using a sequence tag-specific primer and a primer specific to each sRNA.31 Because we designed specific primers within 50 bp from the 5' terminus of each sRNA to amplify nearly full-length sRNAs, we were unable to design optimal primers for three sRNAs. To analyse these three sRNAs, the primers were designed slightly further downstream from the 5' terminus (AaHKsRNA020, 40–58 bp from the 5' terminus; AaHKsRNA037, 26–53 bp; and AaHKsRNA040, 34–60 bp). In addition, we were not able to design specific primers for 35 sRNAs, because identical or nearly identical sequences to any primer candidate sequences were found in other genomic loci. Therefore, we finally constructed an RT-PCR system to detect 85 of the 120 sRNAs identified by RNA-seq. Using this system, we confirmed the expression of 70 sRNAs (53 IGR sRNAs and 17 asRNAs) (Fig. 4A;Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). Our inability to detect the expression of other 15 sRNAs might have been due to the lower sensitivity of this RT-PCR system and/or the incomplete optimization of the PCR primers and/or conditions.

Comparison of sRNA repertoires among A. actinomycetemcomitans strainsA comparison of the sRNA sets identified in strains 624 and HK1651 suggested that a significant difference in sRNA repertoire between A. actinomycetemcomitans strains might exist. Therefore, we used the RT-PCR system described above to analyse the expression of 70 sRNAs in four A. actinomycetemcomitans strains (Y4, ATCC29523, NCTC9710, and IDH781). Figure 4A and B and Supplementary Table S7 show that 44 sRNAs (37 IGR sRNAs and seven asRNAs) were detected in all five A. actinomycetemcomitans strains, whereas 5 sRNAs were specifically detected in HK1651. The remaining 21 sRNAs were variably detected in the four strains, but the number of sRNAs detected in Y4 and NCTC9710 (64 and 60, respectively) was higher than in ATCC29523 and IDH781 (47 in both).Because as much as 37% of the sRNAs analysed (26 of 70) was variably detected in the five strains, we investigated the existence of genomic loci encoding the 26 sRNAs in the strains by PCR. Of the six sRNAs not detected by RT-PCR in strain Y4, three were not detected by PCR of genomic DNA. Similarly, in the other strains, 5 of 10 (NCTC9710), 15 of 23 (ATCC29523), and 16 of 23 (IDH781) sRNAs were not detected by PCR of genomic DNA (Supplementary Table S7). Because the complete genome sequence was available for IDH781, we further examined the IDH781 sequences corresponding to the 16 primers that did not yield a product in the genomic DNA PCR assays for this strain. This analysis revealed that whereas three primers did not work because of mismatches in the primer sequence (Supplementary Table S2), the genomic loci encoding 13 sRNAs were absent in IDH781 (Supplementary Table S7). This result indicated that, although our inability to detect some sRNAs was due to a primer sequence mismatch, a significant number of sRNAs were not detected by RT-PCR because their genes were actually absent in the strain. Although seven sRNAs were found in the chromosome of IDH781, their expression was not detected by RT-PCR without a primer mismatch. We checked the upstream regions of the seven sRNAs and found that four sRNAs contained one or two single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the -50 position of each sRNA, when compared with the HK1651 sequence (AaHKsRNA019; -47C/T, AaHKsRNA028; -10C/T and -39G/A, AaHKsRNA054; -45C/T, and AaHKsRNA076; -3C/G), and AaHKsRNA097 showed no homology at the promoter region, when compared with the HK1651 sequence, whereas the other two sRNAs had no SNPs. These SNPs or the deletion found in the 5' UTR region may be associated with the intraspecies variation of the expression of the sRNAs.These data, together with those from the comparison of sRNAs between strains 624 and HK1651, indicated that the sRNA repertoire is notably different among A. actinomycetemcomitans strains. A phylogenetic tree based on five housekeeping genes showed that HK1651 was closely related to Y4 and NCTC9710 but not to ATCC29523 and IDH781 (Fig. 4C). The distribution/conservation patterns of the sRNAs of the five strains were consistent with their phylogenetic relationships; strains more closely related to HK1651 (Y4 and NCTC9710) shared more sRNAs with HK1651 (Fig. 4B and C), thus suggesting the lineage-dependent acquisition or deletion of these sRNAs during the evolution of these A. actinomycetemcomitans strains. A similar result has been reported for other species such as Campylobacter jejuni, which shows a differential distribution pattern of sRNAs among strains.32 Although intraspecies variation in the sRNA repertoire has not been well elucidated in other bacteria, similar strain-to-strain variation may be observed in many other bacterial species.Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans have been classified into seven serotypes, and certain characteristics of their virulence properties differ among the serotypes. Specifically, serotype b strains have stronger virulence than other serotypes.1,33,34 Recently, the phylogenetic distance of 31 strains of A. actinomycetemcomitans including HK1651 has been analysed using 397 core genes, and their phylogeny has been found to be divisible into five clades, one of which is constructed in the serotype b strains.35 In a sRNAs distribution/conservation pattern analysis, HK1651 and Y4, which are serotype b, exhibited the closest pattern, when compared with the other three strains that showed other serotypes (NCTC9710; serotype c, ATCC29523; serotype a and IDH781; serotype d) (Fig. 4B). Additionally, the phylogenetic distances of HK1651 and Y4, constructed using the five housekeeping genes, were the closest (Fig. 4C). Therefore, the presence of sRNA and its regulatory mechanism may be a determinant of virulence among the different serotypes.3.4. Expression of sRNAs during growthThe expression levels of the RT-PCR products of the 70 sRNAs detected by RT-PCR in HK1651 were further analysed in the early- and late-exponential phases. As shown in Supplementary Table S8, we identified 17 sRNAs exhibiting greater than 2-fold changes during late-exponential phase compared with early-exponential phase (nine were upregulated and eight were downregulated). A previous study has demonstrated that the expression of sRNA Aa35 in A. actinomycetemcomitans strain VT1169, which corresponds to AaHKsRNA003 in strain HK1651, is drastically decreased during the stationary phase compared with the exponential phase.16 Consistent with this, the expression of AaHKsRNA003 (Aa35) exhibited a 3.5-fold decrease during late-exponential phase. To analyse the cis-acting regulation by asRNA, the transcriptional levels of genes located on opposite strands of four asRNAs (downregulated sRNAs; AaHKsRNA011, 066 and 070, upregulated sRNA; AaHKsRNA106) that showed altered expression during growth were analysed by qPCR. Three of the four genes (HK1651_09435, HK1651_05805, and HK1651_05685) showed slightly decreased transcription in the late-exponential phase (data not shown). Generally, many of asRNA negatively affects the gene expression.8 However, some sRNAs were reported as positive regulator such as GadY. GadY asRNA stabilized gadX transcripts through interacting with 3' UTR of gadX mRNA.36 Although two asRNAs (AaHKsRNA066 and 070) may regulate the expression of the target gene positively, AaHKsRNA066 and 070 locate in a CDS, not in 3' UTR, of the opposite strand transcripts, suggesting AaHKsRNA066 and 070 may have a different regulation mechanism with GadY asRNA.3.5. Target prediction of IGR RNAsFinally, the target mRNAs of the 83 IGR sRNAs identified in the present study (excluding 7 IGR sRNAs; tmRNA, 6S RNA, RNase P RNA, 2 riboswitches, and 2 signal recognition particle RNAs) were predicted by the IntaRNA programme.25 Lists of the predicted targets are provided in Supplementary Table S9. Although the predicted targets are involved in a wide range of biological functions, the most notable finding was that several IGR sRNAs were predicted to bind to mRNAs encoding known virulence factors. For example, AaHKsRNAs042 was predicted to interact with the mRNA of the leukotoxin export protein (LtxD) (CF65_RS09465) (Fig. 5A), AaHKsRNA093 was predicted to interact with CdtA (CF65_RS02275) (Fig. 5B), and AaHKsRNA051 was predicted to interact with the mRNA of fimbrial protein (Flp1) (CF65_RS02930)37 (Supplementary Fig. S2A). In addition, eight sRNAs [AaHKsRNA004, 015, 025, 036, 046, 065, 068, and 105 (Supplementary Fig. S2B)] were predicted to interact with mRNA of the virulence-associated protein D, which encodes a homologue of Haemophilus influenza VapD that is a part of a toxin–antitoxin system.38 Of these sRNAs, AaHKsRNA065 was expressed only in serotype b strains (HK1651 and Y4) (Supplementary Table S7). Therefore, the interaction of this sRNA and vapD mRNA may be one of the determinants of strong virulence in the serotype b. Putative sRNA interaction with mRNA encoding ltxD (A) and cdtA (B). Nucleotide sequences of sRNA (1) and the region of the target gene upstream and downstream of the start codon (2) were shown. Underlines indicate the region of sRNA–mRNA binding predicted by IntaRNA.

In IDH781, the 34 detectable IGR sRNAs (excluding 7 IGR sRNAs; tmRNA, 6S RNA, RNase P RNA, 2 riboswitches, and 2 signal recognition particle RNAs) by our RT-PCR were compared with the corresponding sRNAs in HK1651. We found that the 18 sRNAs contained 1–7 SNPs (Supplementary Table S10). We predicted the targets of the 18 sRNAs to analyse the switching of the target mRNAs due to the SNPs by using the HK1651 RefSeq sequence because the IDH781 RefSeq sequence was not supported in IntaRNA. Some of the prediction patterns were drastically altered by a few SNPs (Supplementary Table S10), thus suggesting that SNPs in the sRNA may affect the regulatory systems among the strains.These data, together with other data obtained in this study, should serve as an important genomic and genetic basis for future studies to fully understand the sRNA-involved regulatory network in A. actinomycetemcomitans and provide new insights into the intraspecies variation of the bacterial sRNA repertoire in bacteria. Functional analyses of each sRNA in different conditions and sRNA repertoire analyses of a wider range of strains, including those in closely related species, will enhance our understanding of the regulatory network in A. actinomycetemcomitans, especially that regulates the virulence of this important periodontal pathogen.This study was supported in part by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research (C) (Grant No: 25462868) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Sciences, and Technology of Japan.DRA submission number, DRA005568; DRR accession number, DRR088289.None declared.

Thus, our methodology can potentially be used to deepen our understanding of fungal microbial function and phylogeny using minute amounts of RNA material.IntroductionArbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) are peculiar organisms that evolved an obligate symbiotic relationship with plant roots. This mutually beneficial association occurs in more than 80% of plant species1 and is suggested to have facilitated the colonization of land by plants.2,3 In this partnership, plants provide the fungal partner with photosynthetic carbon sources and lipids in exchange for micro- and macro-elements (e.g. phosphates and nitrates) scavenged by AMF from the surrounding soil environment.4 AMF also interact with other soil microorganisms and are known drivers of ecosystem biodiversity, as they increase plant nutrient uptake and growth, along with resistance to pathogens.5,6 AMF spores and hyphae also harbour thousands of nuclei flowing in a common cytoplasm (a coenocyte) and were thought to be asexual organisms. The genomic organization of this nuclear population has long remained a puzzle,7–10 but recent data from the model species Rhizoglomus irregulare (also known as Rhizophagus irregularis and misidentified as Glomus intraradices11,12) showed the existence of conventional homokaryotic/dikaryotic patterns in this species that drive mating in sexual fungi.13,14To date, AMF taxonomy has been based on spore morphology (presence/absence of several contrasting layers, textures and shape) and analyses of ribosomal ribonucleic acid genes (rRNA).15,16 Using the small subunit rRNA sequences (SSU), AMF were included in a monophyletic phylum called Glomeromycota,17 but recent phylogenomic data led to the erection of a new phylum called Mucoromycota, in which AMF now have their own subphyla, the Glomeromycotina.18 A total of 288 AMF species have been described, of which 60% were sequenced for at least one of ribosomal marker.19 The taxonomy of this group experience frequent reshufflings of nomenclature amendments.20,21 To alleviate this, it was proposed that AMF taxonomy should move towards a functional era22 or that phylogenomics should be used to elucidate their clade affiliations.19Advances in sequencing technologies have geared us towards a functional and genome-based Glomeromycotina research, as evidenced by the recent publication of transcriptomes23–27 and genome drafts28,29 from two model AMF genera, namely those of R. irregulare and R. clarus, and those of sister-species G. rosea and G. margarita. Available data have provided essential information on AMF symbiosis, revealing conserved features for obligate biotrophy, effector proteins and genes involved in their molecular interactions with hosts and endosymbiotic bacteria. However, coding sequence data from hundreds of pot-cultured AMF species is virtually non-existent.The goal of our study is to acquire primary functional and phylogenetic information from quiescent spores of poorly studied AMF. To this end, we used an approach originally designed for single cell transcriptomics.30 In principle, this methodology could generate coding sequence information from minute amounts of RNA extracted from quiescent spores cultured in pots, while simultaneously leaving-out most of the bacterial contamination.We show that this method can lead to successful acquisition of large-scale coding data from spores of eight AMF genera (Claroideoglomus, Funneliformis, Paraglomus, Ambispora, Acaulospora, Diversispora, Dentiscutata and Scutellospora) using ultra-low amounts of RNA. This data provides a first insight into the functional diversity of species for which no coding sequence is available, and is readily usable for mapping, orthology assignment and phylogenetic analyses. Our data compares favourably against reference transcriptomes generated from in vitro cultured species, suggesting that this method could be used for comparing expression levels among different AMF life-stages or across spatial locations within cultures, including in plantae.Materials and methodsIsolation and preparation of the biological materialIn this study, quiescent spores from a total of nine AMF species were harvested, including Rhizoglomus irregulare (DAOM-234181), Funneliformis mosseae (DAOM-236685), Acaulospora morrowiae (INVAM-CR315B), Diversispora versiforme (INVAM-W475-40), Scutellospora calospora (INVAM-IL209), Racocetra castanea (BEG-1), Paraglomus brasilianum (DAOM-240472) and Ambispora leptoticha (INVAM-JA116). Spores were thoroughly identified and maintained in Agriculture and Agri-food Canada (AAC) Glomeromycotina in vivo pot culture collections. This fungal collection is commonly used by international researchers interested in all aspects of AMF biology, and are regularly checked for contamination using both morphological and molecular techniques (i.e. small subunit of the rRNA gene, SSU; H+ ATPAses).For all species, only quiescent spores with intact morphology and lipid content were used for downstream analyses using an inverted microscope. Spores were originally collected by using a sieve cascade of descending size ranging from 500 µm to 63 µm. Lowest fractions were extracted, placed in a 50 ml Falcon tube with the addition of 50% w/w sucrose solution. After centrifugation at 5,000 g for 5 min, supernatant was collected for single spore isolation, and species identification was confirmed using morphological descriptions detailed in Supplementary Figures S1.1–S1.9, and by sequencing the SSU using DNA isolated from random spores. Claroideoglomus claroideum (DAOM-234280) was obtained from an in vitro culture on M medium31 in symbiosis with Agrobacterium-transformed Daucus carota roots. Spore surface sterilization was performed three times for each spore using successive baths of Chloramine-T 2% Tween 20 for 2 min and sterile distilled water for 1 min. Spores were incubated overnight in a solution of streptomycin 0.2 mg/ml and gentamycin 0.1 mg/ml and washed in a final bath of sterile distilled water. Sterilized spores were stored at 4°C.RNA extraction, quantification, and cDNA synthesisRNA was extracted using the NucleoSpin RNA XS kit (Macherey-Nagel, Germany) under a sterilized laminar flow hood. Spores were crushed in sterile nuclease-free 1.5 ml Eppendorf tubes with a micro-pestle and the RNA isolation step followed manufacturer’s recommendations. The cDNA was produced using the SMARTer Ultra Low Input RNA Kit for sequencing v4 used for single cell transcriptomic (SCT) (Takara Bio USA Inc.) following manufacturer’s recommendations. Adapters were used as template for cDNA synthesis and downstream PCR for the cDNA amplification. Two positive controls (Diluted Control RNA) provided with the kit and one negative control (no sample) were performed. The resulting cDNA was purified using the PCR-Purification kit (QIAGEN), and quantification and quality assessment was performed using a Qbit 2.0 fluorimeter with the dsDNA HS (High Sensitivity) Assay Kit.cDNA illumina sequencing and reads assemblyThe cDNA of all species was processed using the Nextera-XT DNA library preparation kit (Illumina). The resulting libraries were quality checked using a high-throughput bioanalyzer (Caliper LabChip GX instrument), and sequenced using one full lane of Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument, using the High-Output V4 mode and paired-reads 2x125 bp (Fasteris SA, Switzerland). The generated paired-end reads were trimmed using the TrimGalore v.0.4.1 software with a Phred score cut-off of 20 and TruSeq Illumina adapter sequences were removed with CutAdapt v.1.8.3. Trimmed reads were assembled de novo using Trinity v.2.1.1.32 A genome-guided assembly was performed for R. irregulare reads obtained by SCT. In this case, paired-end reads were mapped back against the reference genome assembly and all the CDS, respectively, using the Burrows–Wheeler alignment tool (BWA v0.7.10),33 with the BWA-MEM algorithm. SAMtools v0.1.1934 was used to convert SAM files into sorted BAM. The assembly results and statistics are available in supporting information (Supplementary Table S1). Raw reads are deposited in GenBank (accession number SRX2583204-SRX2583220). Assemblies and annotations are available at https://github.com/zygolife/AMF_Phylogenomics (14 November 2017, date last accessed).Functional annotation pipelineSCT data and reference transcriptomes of R. irregulare and G. rosea23,25 annotated using the Trinotate v.2.0.2 annotation pipeline. The pipeline makes use of a wide range of algorithms, methods and databases for functional annotation. These include blastx and blastp35 against UniRef and SwissProt databases, HMMER3,36 the Pfam database,37 SignalP38 tmHMM,39 eggnog, GO40 and KEGG.41 Non-redundant virtual transcripts (NRVTs) for each strain were obtained by filtering the predicted Trinity genes for unique occurrences using the text manipulation tool of the Galaxy webserver.42 The annotated data set were filtered by separating NRVTs into taxonomic-affiliated groups (i.e. Glomeromycotina, Other Fungi, Other Eukaryotes, Bacteria, Archaea, Plantae and Virus). The Glomeromycotina NRVTs predicted GO-terms were used as input in the Web Gene Ontology Annotation Plot (WEGO)43 to obtain a hierarchical histogram of the GO ontology related functions. All taxonomic-sorted NRVTs were fed into the TransDecoder v.3.0.1 software to predict their ORFs (>100 aa). ORFs were used as input in the webMGA webserver44 to obtain KOG classes’ functions and protein domain families.Orthology clustering analysisOrthologous affiliation and shared functionality of NRVTs was obtained using FastOrtho, an OrthoMCL-based program.45 Transdecoder v.3.0.1 predicted protein sequences (>100 aa) of four NRVT classes (Glomeromycotina-, Unknown-, Other Eukaryotes-, Prokaryotes-annotated) were used as inputs with an e-value cut-off of 1e-05. The output was filtered with the Galaxy webtool42 to identify orthogroups shared among AMF strains and the number of genes present in these groups. BUSCO analyses (v.2.0) were performed on the Glomeromycota-annotated NRVTs, orthologous shared Unknown- and Other Eukaryotes-annotated NRVTs using the fungi_odb9 database and the species Rhizopus oryzae (now known as R. delemar) as reference. In total, 290 core orthologues were assessed for their presence in each transcriptome, respectively.RNA extraction for qPCRQuantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) was used to verify the expression of random regions of the transcriptome obtained using ultra-low input RNA methods. Expression of each region was measured in three biological replicates of R. irregulare consisting of cDNA produced using RNA from approximately 250 spores. Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, Venio, Netherlands) and DNA contamination was removed using the RapidOut DNA Removal Kit (ThermoFisher Scientific). RNA was subjected to RT-PCR using the iScript cDNA synthesis kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Hercules, CA, USA) following manufacturer’s recommendation. Six regions of the AMF transcriptome were selected (6230, 8946, 1110, 9312, 910 and a-tubulin) for analysis using qPCR and corresponding primers were designed (Supplementary Table S2). Real-time PCR reactions were carried out in a CFX 96 thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories) in technical duplicates and consisted of 4.5 µl of H2O, 1 µl each of forward and reverse primers, 7.5 µL of SsoFast 2X master mix (Bio-Rad Laboratories) and 1 µl of undiluted cDNA. The qPCR protocol consisted of an initial incubation at 95°C for 30 s followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s and 59.3°C for 5 s and a final melt curve from 60 to 95°C with 0.5°C increments. The primer efficiency set was determined using a serial dilution, temperature gradient and efficiency between 90% and 110%.Phylogenomic analysisA phylogenomic pipeline was applied to a set of 434 conserved genes.18 The 40 species selected include the 8 newly sequenced AMF species, 2 previously published references of R. irregulare and G. rosea, 8 other Mucoromycota representatives, 8 Dikarya fungi, 7 Zoopagomycota, four Chytridiomycota, 2 Blastocladiomycota and 1 Cryptomycota (Rozella). For AMF, the following number of partial sequences were recovered as best reciprocal hit, an approach that was shown to often outperformed projects with more complex algorithms including OrthoMCL,46 to an hmmsearch reflecting the relative completeness of these transcriptomes for these query proteins: Acaulospora morrowiae, 337 genes; Ambispora leptoticha, 206 genes; Claroideoglomus_claroideum, 313 genes; Diversispora versiforme, 222 genes; Funneliformis mosseae, 426 genes; Gigaspora rosea, 385 genes; Paraglomus occultum, 334 genes; Racocetra castanea, 428; Scutellospora calospora, 427 genes; Rhizophagus irregularis, 423 genes.The tree was rooted with the choanoflagellate Monosiga brevicolis. The pipeline, including all associated data is archived in the github repository https://github.com/zygolife/AMF_Phylogenomics (14 November 2017, date last accessed). The approach uses HMMER336 to search the predicted proteins of each strain with profile Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) constructed from a set of conserved markers denoted ‘JGI_1086’ (https://github.com/zygolife/AMF_Phylogenomics (14 November 2017, date last accessed)). A table of the best protein match for each HMM query in each proteome is recorded. A multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is constructed for each marker gene with the single best copy protein from each strain or omitted if no sequence is of sufficient similarity. These MSAs were trimmed with trimAl47 using the automated1 option and requiring all sequences to match at least 50% of residues with an overlap with at least 60% of the rest of the sequences (-resoverlap 0.50 -seqoverlap 60). The resulting individual protein alignments were concatenated into a single alignment with one sequence per species. A bootstrapped maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree was inferred from this alignment using RAxML v8.2.848 with rapid bootstrapping (-f a -o Mbre -m PROTGAMMALG -s AMF.2016_Oct_06.JGI1086.41sp.fasaln -n Standard.AMF.2016_Oct_06.JGI1086.41sp -N autoMRE –d). The resolved tree was visualized in FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/ (14 November 2017, date last accessed)). In parallel, the CAT+G4 model of amino acid substitution implemented in PhyloBayes 3 was also used.49 In this case, two concurrent chains were run in parallel and were terminated manually after 1,116 cycles. Both methodologies varied only in their placement of Chytidiomycota and Blastocladiomycota as the most basal fungal phylum.Results and discussionAcquisition of transcriptome data from poorly studied AMF speciesInitial attempts to obtain sufficient RNA from 1 to 20 single AMF spores resulted in unsuccessful cDNA amplifications. However, subsequent RNA extractions from more spores (n = 22–175, Fig. 1) resulted in successful extractions and sequencing. The size of spores appeared to play a major role in the amount of RNA extracted, with taxa in the Gigasporaceae harbouring more RNAs than relatives with smaller spores (for variation in spore shape and size see Supplementary Figure S1). The RNA extraction ranged from a mere 3 ng for P. brasilianum to a maximum of 720 ng for S. calospora. Assembly statistics vary substantially among the data sets (Supplementary Table S1), but high RNA yield did not necessarily result in better assemblies. The lowest and highest number of transcripts and gene predictions were found for the S. calospora and D. versiforme related data, respectively. These also show the highest and lowest assembly sizes and predictions, while GC% was found to be lowest for transcriptome isolated from C. claroideum spores (30%). SCT transcriptomes from R. irregulare (260 bp) and S. calospora (1,091 bp) had the smallest and largest N50, respectively.

Moreover, 89.6% of known R. irregularis CDS28 are mapped by our SCT reads (Supplementary Table S3) with coverage ranging from 11 to 50. Read mapping considerably improved our original R. irregularis de novo assembly (from 61,050 to 36,848 predicted genes).When the longest isoform of each predicted gene is considered, the taxonomic distribution of NRVTs from SCT and the reference data set are largely comparable (Fig. 2A). The NRVTs and Glomeromycotina-annotated genes are 23,753 vs 25,906 and 51.8 vs 55.7% for the SCT and reference based data, respectively, and proportion of prokaryotic NRVTs is very low in both cases (0.8% and 1.3%). When transcriptomes are annotated using the same methodology, both conditions show identical GO-term functions with surprisingly comparable percentages for the vast majority of categories, around the 50% parity threshold (Fig. 2B). Mapping S. calospora and R. castanea SCT reads against an assembly and CDS from a similar Gigasporacea taxon (kindly provided by Christophe Roux) leads to similar findings. Overall, these analyses indicate that the SCT method does not introduce strong biases in functional annotation and read mapping, and could be applicable to transcriptomic analyses of other AMF stages, tissues etc. (A) Taxonomic distribution comparison of the annotated NRVTs between the R. irregulare reference transcriptome28 and the genome-guided assembly of the in vivo R. irregulare transcriptome obtained from 150 spores.

The comparison is made between the reference R. irregulare transcriptome23 and the genome-guided assembly of the in vivo R. irregulare transcriptome obtained by SCT from 150 spores.Taxonomical and functional analysis of SCT-based transcriptomesUsing identical pipelines and procedures, we compared the NRVTs taxonomic distribution and functional annotations of all SCT data with a reference transcriptome from G. rosea.25 To avoid the analysis of potential contaminants, all functional analyses were performed exclusively on Glomeromycota orthologues shared among samples analysed in this study, and no evidence of cross-contamination among our samples was found by inspecting 100 random orthologue alignments. These analyses represent a first snapshot of the coding diversity of an AMF life-stage (the spore) typically seen as dormant, from eight species for which no coding sequence is currently available. However, this data does not represent an analysis of species-specific transcript due to lack of intra-sample replication. Reference G. rosea data used for comparisons comes from a variety of conditions (in vitro, in vivo, spores, extra-radical mycelium, etc.). The G. margarita transcriptome24 was not analysed here to avoid redundancy—i.e. both taxa represent sister-species and data sets harbour essentially the same number of NRVTs; ˜ 80,00025).Overall taxonomic distributions of SCT transcriptomes showed remarkable similarities with that of G. rosea; particularly for the best assembly (S. calospora, R. castanea, C. claroideum, F. mossea) (Fig. 3). When only Glomeromycotina-annotated NRVTs are considered, the predicted proteins can be classified into 25 KOG functional classes. In support of recent genome analyses, the most represented KOG classes for all transcriptomes were the signal transduction mechanisms and post-translational modifications, with most represented molecular functions being binding and catalytic activity. The majority of biological processes related to GO-terms were for the cellular and metabolic process (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). Unsurprisingly, most NRVTs have no known function and/or taxonomic affiliation. Prokaryotic NRVTs are abundant in four species (Dve, Pbr, Ale and Amo) (40.3, 18.9, 24 and 26.4%, respectively) (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S6), and many of these show high sequence similarity with known AMF or fungal prokaryotic endosymbionts,24,50,51 especially to Glomeribacter gigasporarum. Most putative bacterial transcripts are involved in translation structure and biogenesis, as well as amino-acid and energy metabolism, Supplementary Table S7). Taxonomic distribution and comparison of the annotated NRVTs between all AMF SCT transcriptomes and the G. rosea reference transcriptome.25 Regions corresponding to the percentage of Glomeromycotina with GO-terms, glomeromycotina, other fungi, other eukaryotes, prokaryotes and unknown affiliation annotated NRVTs, respectively are shown. The numbers located at the end of the histogram bars represents the total number of NRVTs.Taxonomic distribution and comparison of the annotated NRVTs between all AMF SCT transcriptomes and the G. rosea reference transcriptome.25 Regions corresponding to the percentage of Glomeromycotina with GO-terms, glomeromycotina, other fungi, other eukaryotes, prokaryotes and unknown affiliation annotated NRVTs, respectively are shown. The numbers located at the end of the histogram bars represents the total number of NRVTs.Orthology analysis and SCT completenessTo identify conservation across data set, an orthology clustering analysis was performed on the Glomeromycotina-, Unknown- and Eukaryote-annotated NRVTs that clustered within orthogroups (Fig. 4, Supplementary Figure S2). The Glomeromycotina-annotated subgroups are surprisingly conserved among transcriptomes. Specifically, a total of 232 orthogroups were found to be shared by all transcriptomes, and the percentage of shared transcripts among SCT data sets ranged from 61.4% to 87.2%. The function of these shared AMF genes broadly reflects that of the Glomeromycotina-annotated NRVT data set. Orthogroup conservation also shows evidence of correlation with phylogenetic relationships (Supplementary Table S8). The presence of 6 orthologues involved in different biological categories was further validated using RT-qPCRs procedures using RNA extracted from R. irregularis spores (Supplementary Figure S3). Interestingly, conservation across data sets extends to NRVTs with unknown functions and Eukaryotic homologues, although none of these were found to be shared by all 10 data sets (Supplementary Figure S2 and Table S8).

The total number of proteins included in the orthology analysis and the percentage of total shared protein is shown within the flower petals, along with the species identifier (Gro: Gigaspora rosea Reference; Rir: Rhizoglomus irregulare Reference; Ccl: Claroideoglomus claroideum; Fmo: Funneliformis mosseae; Ale: Ambispora leptoticha; Pbr: Paraglomus brasilianum; Amo: Acaulospora morrowiae; Dve: Diversispora versiforme; Rca: Racocetra castanea; Sca: Scutellospora calospora).

Reference transcriptomes lack between 13.1% and 22.1% of genes, compared with 21.4–77.6% for the SCT samples. Generally, reference RNA-seq data are more complete, and less fragmented, with the exception of data from S. castanea. Each transcriptome contained between 126 and 1444 (Amo and Ale, respectively) unique glomeromycotan transcripts. Their AMF origin indicates that homologues of these genes are also present in other members of the phylum. The 30 most represented data set-specific families include homologues of known AMF genes (tyrosine kinases, extracellular proteins SEL-1, proteins containing BTB/POZ and Kelch domains, TRAP230 subunit hormone receptors, Supplementary Table S9). All these homologues are also found in publicly available AMF genome data. Importantly, our data also confirms the absence of most homologues of Glomeromycotina core genes (MGCGs; a term recently coined by Tang et al. 201625; Supplementary Table S10). Transcriptome representativeness comparison among the AMF SCT data sets and the reference R. irregulare and G. rosea RNA-seq, performed using a BUSCO benchmark. In total, 290 core fungal genes were search across these data sets and evaluated for completeness, single-copy (S), duplication (D), fragmentation (F) and absence (M). The histogram representations shows the percentage of the genes (and number indicated above the bars) belonging in these categories, for each species.Transcriptome representativeness comparison among the AMF SCT data sets and the reference R. irregulare and G. rosea RNA-seq, performed using a BUSCO benchmark.

The Zoopagomycota is sister to the Dikarya and Mucoromycota clade. Within Mucoromyota, the Glomeromycotina is monophyletic and sister to the Mucoromycotina and Mortierellomycotina clade, though there is no strong support for their specific branching.

The corresponding fungal phylum of each main clades are identified on the right side of the figure and is highlighted by the gray shaded area.Within the Glomeromycotina, most known phylogenetic relationships based morphology and SSU trees are strongly supported. Specifically, our analyses confirms the basal position of the Ambisporaceae and Paraglomeraceae in the AMF tree, groups together members of the Gigasporaceae (Scutellospora, Gigaspora, Racocentra) and Glomeraceae (Rhizophagus and Funneliformis), and supports the evolutionary relationship between Acaulosporacea and Diversisporaceae.12 The only conflict with past phylogenies is represented by C. claroideum, which clusters with A. leptothica and P. brasiliensis with strong support.SCT exposes the RNA diversity of overlooked AMF spores and new phylogenetic relationships within the glomeromycotinaOur approach based on low-input RNA produced transcriptomes with high conservation in sequence and function across the AMF phylogeny, and revealed a diverse functional diversity expressed in life-stages that are supposedly dormant. We confirm that MGCGs orthologues involved in invertase activity (SUC2 homolog) are likely absent in this phylum. The absence of the invertase orthologues in 10 transcriptomes comforts the ‘Glomeromycotina core symbiotic concept’, which proposes that the host plant is responsible for sucrose production and hydrolysis.Spores of all species express many copies of BTB/POZ and vprBP homolog domain, which are known facilitators of the ubiquitin-protein ligase complexes.53 ‘Kelch domains’, which form general protein–protein interaction modules, are also very abundant in all transcriptomes.54 Spores also express many alpha amylase related proteins in all data sets, as well as several glycoside hydrolase, lipases and proteases. These possibly confer AMF the molecular toolkit to enzymatically breakdown complex carbohydrates (polysaccharides), multiple protein and lipid substrates, either from the environment, their host or cell energy reserves.55,56 Our study also revealed thousands of ‘unknown’ glomeromycotan coding sequences shared among all transcriptomes. Their abundance and high conservation across data sets highlights the importance of this ‘uncategorized’ realm of genes for the AMF biology.AMF spores also share a number of transcripts encoded by putative AMF symbionts, including G. gigasporarum and mollicutes-related endosymbionts (MREs). Their genomes harbour genes linked to their host metabolism, in the intricate molecular dialogue between AMF and their intra-cellular inhabitants; particularly the expression of AMF genes involved in growth, development and transport in its fungal host.24,51,57 Our data shows that endosymbionts are transcriptionally active in AMF spores, expressing a variety of functions, including translation, amino-acid metabolism or energy production.The multigene fungal phylogeny we report also show that acquisition of larger coding data set could result in the reorganization of certain AMF families. This is particularly true for the Claroideoglomeraceae, Ambisporaceae and Paraglomeraceae, which group together with full support in our analyses but not in rRNA based phylogenies.11 It will be interesting to see if the addition of new taxa to this multi-gene alignment—e.g. Geosiphon, Archeospora, Pacispora—will reshuffle this novel evolutionary affiliation, as the genus Claroideoglomus has been typically associated with the Glomeraceae, though with much lower support. Our low-input RNA method could also represent a stepping stone for producing future solid and durable AMF classifications,19 and could help selecting suitable protein-coding markers that are representative of the global phylogenetic signal. Such data is crucial to enter a new era of AMF classification based on functionality, as proposed by Gamper et al.22Ultra-low input RNA methods as a tool to deepen our understanding of AMF biology and evolutionHere, we showed that the methodologies based on ultra-low input RNA represents reliable avenues to obtain large AMF coding sequence data and important functional insights from minute amounts of RNA extracted from spores of recalcitrant AMF species. These results are a solid foundation to build future knowledge on other species in the group, and deepen our understanding of this ecologically important group. The data we collected also revealed that spores from many under sampled AMF taxa express a wide panel of transcripts. Some of these could be ‘ready-made’ for germination and/or plant colonization, although it is still unclear whether all spores express these transcripts at significant levels for biological function.From an evolutionary perspective, the wealth of data we provide uncovered phylogenetic relationships that were previously shadowed by a focus on single rRNA gene sequences. Within this context, this transcriptomics data opens the door to phylogenetic classifications that develops markers representative of the global classification and suited for functional ecological studies. In the future, the methods we used could prove useful to assess tissue-specific functionalities, and may offer further insights into the plant–fungus dialogue based on RNA-seq data. Indeed, we have shown that sequencing reads obtained from few spores results, in many cases, in information comparable to that obtained from in vitro cultures. If the trend holds, our method could be applied to study, for instance, how transcription changes along different portions of the mycelium or in plantae. Ultimately, such advances will be essential to better understand how AMF benefit the health of plants or terrestrial ecosystems; processes that are linked to crucial societal challenges such as climate change, sustainable management, pest invasion and food security.We thank anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments on a previous version of the manuscript, and Timea Marton for assistance with RNA extraction procedures.FundingThis work was supported by the Discovery program from the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada (NSERC-Discovery) and an Early Researcher Award from the Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation (ER13-09-190) to N.C.

IntroductionFlowering is a crucial transition from the vegetative growth phase to the reproductive growth phase in the plant life cycle, and flowering time is the most important factor in maintaining seed propagation in crop rotation systems. Brassica napus (AACC, 2n = 38; rapeseed) is a young amphidiploid species (<10,000 years old) resulting from hybridization between Brassica rapa (AA, 2n = 20; Asian cabbage, turnip) and Brassica oleracea (CC, 2n = 18; European cabbage).1,2 Rapeseed is the world’s second largest oilseed crop, with an extensive economic impact in many countries worldwide.3 Rapeseed oil is used not only for human consumption but also as industrial oil for lubricants and as biodiesel.4 In southern China, farmers usually triple-crop annually: rice–rice–oil. With the introduction of B. napus into China in 1960, high-yielding B. napus varieties with disease-resistance and extensive adaptability outcompeted traditional B. rapa and B. juncea varieties, and are now planted widely in China.5–7 However, due to the extended growth period of rapeseed, problems with using rapeseed in the existing crop rotation system are becoming more and more serious. The best way to solve this problem is to breed early-maturing varieties of B. napus, and thus early flowering and maturity have become major breeding goals in subtropical southern China. In temperate regions worldwide (e.g. Canada, the United States and Australia), early flowering and maturity are also important breeding targets for spring B. napus due to the short growth season.8 In addition, flowering period (FP) is critical for B. napus production: longer FPs decrease the risk in hybrid seed production, as well as meeting travel market needs as a sightseeing attraction.9 On the other hand, short and intensive FPs result in better uniformity of maturity time (MT), which is beneficial for mechanized harvesting of rapeseed.Through extensive studies of genetic control networks for flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana, we know that several pathways [vernalization, photoperiod, gibberellic acid (GA), autonomous pathway and thermal clock] and more than 100 genes are involved in the flowering process.10 However, it is a difficult task to find the optimal time switch for flowering time in this gene network.11–13 In the last few decades, QTL analysis has been used to investigate genetic variation for many complex agronomic traits in crops, and in particular flowering time traits. Many QTLs for flowering time in B. napus have been identified using bi-parental mapping populations.14–22 However, bi-parental QTL analysis usually has the limitation of low resolution as well as low generalizability to crop breeding due to the participation of only two alleles from parents in the linkage mapping. In addition, some QTLs with small effects will not be detected, so these deficiencies need to be solved by other, newer methods.Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), also known as association mapping or linkage disequilibrium (LD) mapping, aim to identify genetic variants linked to traits based on LD.23 GWAS has the advantages of higher resolution and greater cost-effectiveness relative to bi-parental segregating populations, and excavates QTLs or genes from natural populations. GWAS performed with numerous SNPs has been used in A. thaliana, Zea mays and Oryza sativa.24–26 In recent years, using the Illumina Infinium Brassica 60 K SNP array, many studies used GWAS to detect genetic variation for agronomic traits in rapeseed. For example, Li et al. investigated the genetic architecture of seed weight and seed quality, detecting many significant marker–trait associations.27 Liu et al. identified 50 loci significantly associated with seed oil content in a panel of 521 B. napus accessions.28 Xu et al. explored 41 SNPs significantly correlated with flowering time, 12 SNPs of which were consistent with previously identified QTLs based on linkage analysis, and 25 candidate genes were implicated.29 Schiessl et al. identified 101 genomic regions associated with initiation of flowering in 158 European winter-type B. napus inbred lines.30 Wang et al. performed a genome-wide association analysis of flowering time with a panel of 448 rapeseed inbred lines, and found at least 40 QTLs significantly associated with flowering time: 117 genomic regions were found related to divergent growth habits, including 20 flowering time QTLs and 224 flowering time genes.31 However, these research studies focused mainly on the trait of initiation of flowering time. Other traits related to flowering time, such as final flowering stage (FFS), FP and MT, have yet to be investigated via GWAS, and the identification of alleles conferring early flowering and maturity in B. napus have not been reported previously.High-density SNP markers distributed across the whole genome are a prerequisite for genome-wide association analysis. Nowadays, it is possible to quickly and efficiently identify a large number of SNPs in a species via high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies.32 In this study, 201,817 SNPs previously developed by SLAF-seq (specific length amplified fragment sequencing)33 were used to perform a GWAS of four traits (IFS, FFS, FP and MT) in 300 inbred rapeseed lines. Correlations between these four traits were studied, SNP loci significantly associated with these traits and flowering time candidate genes were explored and elite allelic variants for earliness were identified. This study provides comprehensive information for understanding the relationship between flowering time variation and earliness traits. These SNPs and candidate genes detected will play an important role in earliness breeding in rapeseed.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Plant materials, growth conditions and field trialsA diversity panel consisting of 300 rapeseed inbred lines (S4 generation or greater) was used for the experimental population in the present study.33 Pertinent information for all accessions is listed in Supplementary Table S1 (the population comprised 257 semi-winter types, 16 spring types and 27 winter types). The association population was grown in the field of Jiangxi Agricultural University (115.84E, 28.77N) and Jiangxi Institute of Red Soil (116.27E, 28.37N) with two replications per location in 2014–15 (designated JXAU and JXIRS, respectively), and all seeds were sown on 29 September 2014 simultaneously in both places. Each variety was planted in a plot with three rows (40 cm line width and 20 cm plant distance), and each row had 12 plants (final seeding time was at the 5–7 leaf phase). Field experiments were arranged by a randomized complete block design. Agronomic practices were kept uniform in both environments.2.2. Phenotypic trait evaluation and statistical analysisDates for each of the four traits were recorded in the field trials: the initial flowering stage (IFS) (the number of days from sowing to the date when the first flower had opened in 25% of the plants in each plot), the FFS (the number of days from sowing to the date when 75% of the plants had stopped blooming completely in each plot), the FP (the number of days equal to the difference between the FFS and the IFS) and the MT (the number of days from sowing to the date when pods on 75% of the plants in each plot were yellow). The traits of each accession were defined as the mean of the two replicates in the same location. The correlation coefficients between traits were determined using Student’s t-test,34 and the variance and statistical analysis of components were obtained using DPS software.352.3. SNP genotypingGenomic DNA was extracted from young healthy leaves of each rapeseed accession using a modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method.37 Quantified DNA was used for SLAF sequencing by an Illumina HiseqTM 2500.38 Previously, through a set of processes of restriction digestion, library construction, paired-end sequencing and SNP calling, a series of 201,817 high-consistent and locus-specific SNPs (minor allele frequency > 0.05 and integrity > 0.8) were selected and used for subsequent analysis of population structure, LD and haplotype blocks in this diversity panel.332.4. Genome-wide association analysis2.5. Discovery of favourable allelic variation for earlinessSNPs with negative allelic effect values highly associated with IFS, FFS and MT were set as favourable alleles for earliness; SNPs with positive allelic effect values for prolonging FP were set as favourable alleles. The number of the favourable alleles in each rapeseed accession was counted.2.6. Candidate genes for flowering time predictionBased on LD analysis for the 300 accessions of rapeseed in our previous study,33 the LD blocks where the significant trait-associated SNPs were situated, in which flanking SNP markers had strong LD (r2 > 0.6),46 were defined as the candidate gene regions (extending from the left unrelated SNP to the right unrelated SNP). The LD block was analysed using the software ‘haploview v4.2’.47 All genes within the same LD block (r2 > 0.6) as significantly trait-associated SNP markers were considered for identification of candidates. For significant SNPs outside of the LD blocks, the 100 kb flanking regions on either side of the markers were used to identify candidate genes. All candidate genes were selected based on gene ontology (GO) terms for flowering, floral development, vernalization, photoperiod and vegetative to reproductive phase.30,33 Subsequently, we carried out BLASTX searches against the Arabidopsis genome to determine the final flowering time candidate genes within the SNP-tagged genome regions.2.7. Comparison of SNPs and QTLs related to flowering time traitsA genomic region of 200 kb (roughly equal to 0.4 cM in genetic map) was set as a single QTL identified in previous research.46,48 These QTL regions containing trait-linked SNPs were compared with the results of our study, and to GWAS results detecting flowering time gene loci using the Illumina Infinium Brassica 60K SNP array to map SNPs to physical positions in the B. napus genome.49 In addition, by anchoring known marker sequences (SSR, RFLP, etc.) to the rapeseed reference genome within the range of 1 Mb, SNPs previously connected to flowering time and MT QTLs in bi-parental mapping populations, as collected in our published article,50 were also compared with the results of our study.3. Results3.1. Phenotypic variation and correlation analysis for the four earliness traits in 300 rapeseed accessionsFour traits related to earliness of 300 rapeseed lines were investigated in two environments in this study. Table 1 showed that the average time to IFS was 145.07 and 150.63 days with the coefficient of variation of 9.88% and 10.11%, respectively, in environments JXAU and JXRIS (Table 1); the minimum was 91 days and the maximum was 192 days. Analogously, the FFS also exhibited a wide range of 169–208 and 163–215 days, with means of 180 and 186 days in JXAU and JXRIS, respectively. The mean value of FP in JXAU was 35.57 days, ranging from 12 to 83 days with a coefficient of variation of 29.21%, and the average number of days for FP in JXIRS was 36.54 with a coefficient of variation of 31.06% (varying from 17 to 97 days), such that large variation was clearly observed for these traits. Finally, the average number of days to maturity was 217.41 days in JXAU, ranging from 203 to 234 days with a coefficient of variation of 2.25%, and the time to maturity in JXIRS was 219.80 days ranging from 210 to 235 days, which exhibited the lowest coefficient of variation of 1.83%. Extensive variation for each of the four traits was observed in two environments, and phenotypic values for each of the four traits were normally distributed (Fig. 1). In addition, the average days to IFS and FFS in environment JXAU was later than in environment JXIRS, by about 5 and 6 days, respectively. However, the FP was generally consistent between the two environments, and the MT in the JXAU environment was only earlier than in the JXIRS environment by 2 days on average. These data implied a broad diversity in earliness phenotypic traits in the population of 300 rapeseed accessions.

Note: The X-axis indicates the trait (days) and Y-axis indicates the accession number.Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was conducted for the 300 accessions to test the effects of genotype (G), environment (E) and their interactions (G × E) for the four traits. All traits varied significantly across the 300 genotypes (P < 0.01; Supplementary Table S2), and there were obvious differences in FP between the two environments (P < 0.05), as well as in the other three traits between the two environments (P < 0.01). However, differences in traits between repetitions were not significant, although G × E interactions were all significant (P < 0.01), suggesting a large environmental impact on these traits in rapeseed. The broad-sense heritability of IFS was calculated to be 95.42%, while FFS, FP and MT had broad sense heritabilities of 92.35%, 91.99% and 87.55%, respectively. All traits were stably inherited with an HB2 higher than 85%.36Initial flowering in the two environments had a highly significant positive correlation with FFS and MT (Table 2), with phenotypic correlation coefficients of 0.7774** and 0.5698** in JXAU and 0.7053** and 0.5118** in JXIRS, respectively, indicating that early flowering means early maturity, with flowering time a crucial indicator for MT. However, FP had a highly significant negative correlation with the other three traits, with phenotypic correlation coefficients of -0.932**, -0.4976** and -0.4053** in JXAU and -08757**, -0.2772** and -0.2903** in JXIRS, respectively, indicating that the sooner flowering time and MT are reached, the longer the FP is, and vice versa.

Genome-wide association analysis for the four earliness traits in the 300 rapeseed accessionsTo uncover the genotypic variations of four traits related to earliness in B. napus, GLM and MLM models for GWAS were evaluated, and the degree of consistency between the observed and expected P values were assessed using QQ plots, both models controlled the generation of the false positives well (Fig. 2), and the significant SNPs associated with traits were displayed on Manhattan plots (Table 3, Figs 3 and 4). The GLM analysis detected a total of 125 SNPs (P < 4.96E-07) significantly associated with four earliness-related traits, and distributed on 18 of the 19 B. napus chromosomes (excluding A04). The largest number of significant SNPs (25) was on chromosome C01, and the second largest number (18 SNPs) was found on chromosome C03 (Fig. 4, Table 3). MLM analysis detected 22 SNPs significantly associated with IFS (3), FFS (3) and FP (18) on 11 chromosomes, 2 of which were associated with IFS and FP simultaneously on chromosome A09 (Table 3). Totally, 131 SNPs significantly associated with four traits were detected on 18 chromosomes by both GLM and MLM analyses.

However, only three SNPs for initial flowering time were found in environment JXAU by MLM analysis, all on chromosome A09 (Supplementary Table S4). Using GLM analysis, 10 SNPs associated with FFS were detected (8 in JXAU and 2 in JXRIS) but no consistent SNPs for FFS were detected in both environments. Using MLM analysis, three SNPs on chromosome A01 in environment JXAU for FFS were detected, one of which was consistent with the GLM predictions (Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). The GLM model detected 106 SNPs associated with FP in environment JXAU, of which 49 SNPs were extremely significant (P < 4.96E-08; Supplementary Table S7), while 78 SNPs associated with FP were detected in environment JXIRS, 22 of which were extremely significant; 16 SNPs were identified in both environments (Supplementary Table S8). MLM analysis identified 18 SNPs for FP (4 in JXAU and 15 in JXIRS with one shared SNP locus in two environments), 15 SNPs of which were consistent with GLM analysis. However, for MT, only nine SNPs were detected in one environment (JXAU) using the GLM model (Supplementary Table S9).3.3. Discovery of useful allelic variation for earlinessIn order to identify elite alleles for earliness breeding in B. napus, we evaluated the allelic effects of SNP loci associated with four earliness-related traits. SNP alleles with positive effects that led to decreases in trait values for IFS, FFS and MT, or that led to an increase in the trait value for FP, were defined as ‘favourable alleles’ for earliness. In our study, we observed 35 favourable alleles from 29 SNP loci for earliness of flowering and maturity, which were present in 288 accessions. Individual accessions had from 1 to 17 favourable alleles for earliness, with 19 accessions having more than 10 alleles for earliness. For this latter group of accessions, mean IFS (130 days) was shorter by 15 days than the mean for all 300 accessions (Supplementary Tables S10 and S11). Figure 5a shows that more favourable alleles resulted in earlier flowering or maturity. For the FP, based on the assessment of allelic effect values, 74 SNP loci (90 alleles) contributed to a prolonged FP, with the number of favourable alleles per accession ranging from 5 to 47. A set of 13 rapeseed lines had more than 20 alleles for long FP, and this group had a much longer average FP (56 days) than the average across all accessions (35 days) (Supplementary Table S12; Fig. 5b shows a long FP phenotype). Furthermore, by comparing the allelic effect values of alleles between the traits of IFS and FP, all alleles promoting early flowering were found to be totally consistent with prolonged FP in all accessions (Supplementary Tables S10, S11 and S13). Among these trait-linked loci, we detected 6 SNPs with 2 favourable allelic variations for earliness in flowering or maturity on chromosomes A01, A02, A09, C03 and C04, and another 16 SNPs with favourable alleles for prolonging FP were distributed on chromosomes A05, A06, A08, C01, C02, C03, C08 and C09. In addition, some SNP loci had different effects associated with each of the two alleles present at the SNP locus: for example, the favourable C allele of Bn-A02-23681432 and Bn-A02-23875175 related to FFS was associated with earlier MT compared with the unfavourable G allele, with an average of about 3 days of phenotypic difference in the two environments (see Fig. 6). These results indicate that the highly favourable SNP alleles exhibit significant positive effects on phenotypic characteristics compared with the unfavourable alleles.

To further uncover the molecular function of the significant SNPs, we obtained the genes within the same LD block or within 100 kb to either side of the significant trait-associated SNPs by BLAST analysis using B. napus ‘Darmor v4.1’ as the reference genome. We screened 1,672 genes in the candidate regions of 80 SNPs significantly associated with the four earliness traits (Supplementary Table S15): 147 candidate genes closely linked with 44 SNPs were obtained based on the GO terms related to flowering time (flowering, floral development, vernalization, photoperiod, vegetative to reproductive transition and gibberellin) (Supplementary Table S16). Of these, 57 flowering time candidate genes closely linked with 33 SNPs in B. napus were identified as orthologous to A. thaliana genes in flowering time networks, which were involved in the flowering regulation pathways of vernalization, photoperiod, GA, autonomous pathway and circadian clock, respectively (Supplementary Figure S2).10 These candidate genes were distributed on 14 chromosomes, 44 of which were distributed on the A subgenome, with the most genes (12) on chromosome A02 and with the other 13 flowering genes located on 5 chromosomes of the C subgenome (Supplementary Table S17, Fig. 7).

Note: The abbreviations of orthologous genes in Arabidopsis thaliana are shown in brackets after the candidate genes. Numbers represent the relative distances in the genome, 1 = 1 kb.In the vicinity of some SNP regions, more than one known flowering time gene was identified (Fig. 7). For example, at the position of SNP Bn-A03-16342394, we found five flowering time candidate genes (orthologous to A. thaliana genes of ABF4, PIE1, VRN1 and ARP6), at the position of SNP Bn-A10-13390883 three important flowering time candidate genes (orthologous to A. thaliana genes of CO, SVP and AtCOL1) were found, at the position of SNP Bn-A03-13764115 four flowering time genes (VGT1, IPP2, GRF7 and COL2) were found, at the position of SNP (Bn-A02-23681432) three flowering time genes (CDF1, HUA2 and CHE) were detected, and three flowering time genes (FT, RGL1 and FLD) were closely adjacent to the position of SNP Bn-A02-6435246. These results indicate that some loci are highly associated with flowering time genes, and that genes controlling flowering tend to be located in clusters in B. napus.51 In addition, we found the significant SNP locus Bn-A03-25129078 is in the inner region of the flowering time candidate gene of GSBRNA2T00044315001 homologous to CURLY LEAF (CLF) of A. thaliana. By evaluating the allelic effect of Bn-A03-25129078 locus, accessions with an A allele for Bn-A03-25129078 had an average of 130 days for IFS in the two environments, 19 days earlier than accessions with the G allele. This indicates that Bn-A03-25129078 is an important SNP locus in promoting early flowering in rapeseed, which also proves the reliability for identifying the candidate genes using GWAS analysis.4. Discussion4.1. Identification and validation of SNP loci associated with traits related to earliness in B. napusIdentifying favourable allelic variation and candidate genes promoting early flowering and maturity is critical for effective use of B. napus in tri-annual crop rotation systems in China. Earliness of B. napus is a very important trait for reducing the planting time conflict during tri-annual crop rotation systems in southern China. However, earliness is a complicated quantitative trait. In previous studies, flowering time in B. napus showed a high genetic correlation (0.73) with MT,17,22,52,53 with QTLs co-localized with plant height in a small region on chromosome A02.20,54 By in silico QTL integration, co-localization of flowering time and MT was also identified on chromosomes A01, A02, A03, A05 and C09.50 Therefore, flowering time is a crucial indicator for MT. In this study, we investigated four traits related to earliness (IFS, FFS, FP and MT) for 300 rapeseed accessions in two environments. High correlations between these traits were also identified, and strong positive correlations existed between the traits of IFS, FFS and MT. Furthermore, we found that the trait of FP was highly negatively correlated with the other three traits. By evaluating the allelic effects of SNP loci associated with four earliness related traits, we revealed that favourable alleles promoting early-flowering and early-maturing are totally opposite to the favourable alleles prolonging flowering days in all accessions. Therefore, we can infer that the rapeseed varieties with alleles for earliness should have longer FPs.In the current study, all four traits showed large phenotypic variation in the two environments, supporting the suitability of genome-wide association analysis for these traits using this diversity panel. A total of 131 SNP loci associated with these traits were detected on 18 chromosomes (except A04), with a high average phenotypic variation for flowering time (9.36%) ranging from 3.27% to 13.17%, of which the greatest number of SNP loci was significantly associated with FP. Many of these SNPs were also associated with IFS. From this, we can infer that SNP loci related to the initiation of flowering also mediate the flowering days. In comparison to bi-parental mapping population results using in silico mapping, eight SNPs detected in our study were consistent with previous flowering time and MT QTLs (in the range of 1 Mb) on chromosomes A02, A03, A05, A06, C03 and C08 16,20,53,55 (Supplementary Table S18). In addition, based on the comparison of SNP regions, 37 SNP regions (within 200 kb) we detected were consistent with results of flowering time from the Brassica 60 K SNP array: 17 were reported by Li et al.,56 16 were reported by Roman et al.46 and 5 were reported by Wang et al.31 (Supplementary Table S19). Overall, at least 34 flowering QTLs in the current study were consistent with at least one QTL identified in one or more previous studies, and five SNP loci regions (Bn-A02-6435246, Bn-A05-21493588, Bn-A06-7621426, Bn-SA03-2039163 and Bn-SC03-643771) were detected simultaneously by linkage mapping and association analysis. In addition, we found the SNP locus of Bn-A03-25129078 is in the inner region of candidate gene of GSBRNA2T00044315001 homologous to CURLY LEAF (CLF) of A. thaliana, while another five candidate genes for flowering time were within 10 kb of significant SNP loci (Supplementary Table S16). These findings strongly support the GWAS results and increase the credibility of the trait-associated SNP loci identified in our study. Furthermore, a total of 91 novel SNP loci from 16 chromosomes were found in our study, 59 of which included 77 favourable alleles promoting early flowering and early maturity (Supplementary Tables S10 and S11), which might comprise new DNA markers for earliness breeding in rapeseed in the future. Moreover, as the SNP markers used in this study were developed from sequencing, their position and alleles are known. Hence, based on our results, breeders can directly obtain valuable data and resources for further research in rapeseed.It is well known that it is difficult to simultaneously improve the early maturity and yield of a crop by traditional breeding methods. Therefore, the excavation of favourable SNP alleles is necessary for improving the complicated earliness trait in rapeseed using molecular marker-assisted selection (MAS). Association mapping has played an important role in exploring the elite alleles of many agronomic traits in B. napus (seed yield, flowering time, seed oil content and fatty acid compositions) in recent years. 48,28,57 In the current study, the phenotypic effect value of each allele for four traits was evaluated to obtain 35 favourable alleles for early flowering and early maturing, and 90 for long FP. In fact, all favourable alleles for prolonging FP were consistent with alleles for promoting flowering, so we can infer that favourable alleles for prolonging FP may also produce positive effects in promoting flowering. Previously, pyramiding effects of favourable SNP alleles has proved useful in building disease resistance, increasing fruit yield and improving quality traits.58–60 By analysing and comparing the favourable alleles for the four traits across the 300 accessions (Supplementary Tables S10–S13, Fig. 5), those which have more favourable alleles (such as ‘Huayou 4’ and ‘Yuyou 2’) might be considered as potential Germplasm resources for earliness breeding, and significant SNPs with favourable alleles can be used for MAS in rapeseed.4.2 Mining of candidate genes to uncover the flowering time gene network and improve earliness in B. napusWithout doubt, the earliness of rapeseed largely depends on a complicated flowering network of genetic factors and their interaction with stimuli from the external environment. The genetic factors inducing the initiation of flowering are best elaborated in the model plant of A. thaliana,10 where the regulation pathways for flowering time include intrinsic (autonomous, circadian clock, gibberellin) and extrinsic factors (vernalization, photoperiod and environmental temperature), and involve more than 100 flowering time genes. In this study, we identified 57 candidate genes of B. napus homologous to 39 flowering time genes of A. thaliana (e.g. AGL24, FT, CO, SVP, FLD, FY) in the vicinity of 33 significantly trait-associated SNP loci. These genes accounted for one-third of the known genetic and epigenetic regulators in the flowering time gene network, and 19 candidate genes homologous to 10 flowering time genes of A. thaliana (TSF, CIB1, PIE1, VRN1, FUL, CKA2, ARP6, FY, ABF4 and CDF3) were detected near 14 novel SNP loci in our study. For these candidate genes for flowering time in B. napus, some of which play a positive role in promoting flowering, homologous genes of A. thaliana were as follows: AGL24, CIB1, CLPS3, CO, RGL1, COR28, FLD, FLK, FT, FUL, FY, GRF7, HUA2, PRMT4A, TSF, VGT1, VRN1 and AP2; other candidate genes for delaying flowering were homologous to EFS, LATE, SVP, AGL18, ABF4, ATXR7, CDF1, CDF3, CLF, CGA1, CKA2, ELF6, ARP6, PIE1 and TEM2 in A. thaliana (Supplementary Table S17). Thus, it is reasonable to suppose that those genes homologous to flowering time genes of A. thaliana for promoting flowering may be considered as candidate genes for improving earliness via the regulation and control of early flowering time in B. napus.Of the flowering time candidate genes detected in this study, gene GSBRNA2T00135488001 adjacent to the SNP locus Bn-A10-13390883 was homologous to CONSTANS (CO), temporal and spatial regulation of which is vital for photoperiod-dependent induction.12 Four orthologues of the A. thaliana CO gene have previously been isolated on chromosomes A10 and C09 in B. napus.61 The GSBRNA2T00098107001 gene adjacent to Bn-A02-21988229 and the GSBRNA2T00126653001 gene adjacent to Bn-A08-10241291 were homologous to CRYPTOCHROME-INTERACTING BASIC-HELIX-LOOP-HELIX 1 (CIB1), which interacts with CRYPTOCHROME 2 (CRY2) to promote CRY2-dependent floral initiation and also positively regulates FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) expression in the photoperiod pathway in A. thaliana.62 In addition, EARLY FLOWERING 6 (ELF6) encodes a Jumonji N/C and zinc finger domain-containing protein that acts as a repressor in the photoperiod pathway, and its loss-of-function mutation causes early flowering63: we found its homologous candidate gene GSBRNA2T00100566001 in the vicinity of Bn-C05-3438659. Many flowering time candidate genes are involved in vernalization pathways, as vernalization promotes flowering indirectly by histone modifications that submerge FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC). At present, five regulator genes (VIN3, VRN5, VRN1, VRN2 and HPL1) related to vernalization have been found in A. thaliana.12 Candidate gene GSBRNA2T00154017001 homologous to VERNALIZATION 1 (VRN1) near SNP Bn-A05-16342394, which could repress FLC gene expression by regulating the chemical modification of histones,64 and three additional candidate genes (GSBRNA2T00153994001, GSBRNA2T00153993001 and GSBRNA2T00132568001) homologous to ACTIN RELATED PROTEIN 6 (ARP6), which could act in the nucleus to modulate FLC gene expression by participating in chromatin histone 3 acetylation,65,66 were found in the vicinity of SNPs Bn-A05-16342394 and Bn-C03-10984518 in this study. Although we did not find homologous for the vital regulator of flowering time FLC in the candidate regions in our study, FLC is not a unique target gene in the vernalization pathway, as AGL19 and AGL24 encoding MADX-box proteins have similar roles to FLC, where up-regulated expression can promote precocious flowering.67,68 We did detect the gene GSBRNA2T00126728001 homologous to AGL24 [in the vicinity of SNP locus (Bn-A08-9750352)], which may play important roles in the downstream regulation of SOC1 and upstream regulation of LFY in several floral pathways: this gene is firstly activated in shoot apical meristems at the stage of floral transition, after which expression is located in inflorescence and floral meristems. FLOWERING LOCUS D (FLD), FLOWERING LOCUS K (FLK) and FY are the most important flowering time genes in the autonomous flowering pathway, as these genes promote flowering indirectly by repressing the expression of FLC, but they have operate via different mechanisms. We found the candidate gene of GSBRNA2T00090976001 homologous to FLD (a high acetylation transcriptional repressor of FLC69) 56.69 kb from the SNP locus Bn-A02-6435246. In addition, we also excavated the candidate genes GSBRNA2T00075319001 (Bn-A03-24569600, 63.03 kb) and GSBRNA2T00065713001 (Bn-C05-29165950, 24.13 kb) homologous to FLK and FY, respectively, both of which encode RNA-binding proteins known to affect flowering time by modulating the mRNA level of FLC.70 In the GA (gibberellin) pathway, RGA-LIKE 1 (RGL1) is known to be a repressor of the GA response pathway controlling flowering,71 and we identified its homologous gene GSBRNA2T00090973001 50.39 kb from Bn-A01-6435246.The floral integrator genes (SOC1, FT and AGL24) play important roles in activating floral meristem formation genes (such as LFY, AP1, SEP3 and FUL). Besides AGL24 mentioned above, we also found the candidate gene GSBRNA2T00090951001 homologous to FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) closely linked with SNP marker Bn-A02-p6435246, which was also reported previously as a flowering time QTL.16 Six orthologues of Arabidopsis FT have previously been identified in the genome of B. napus.72,FT plays a vital role in the floral transition process as the floral integrator in the photoperiod pathway and as a signalling molecule from the leaves to the apical meristem.13,73 As well, gene GSBRNA2T00038536001 on chromosome A05 was proved to be homologous to FRUITFULL (FUL) of Arabidopsis, a MADS-box transcription factor which may act as a molecular switch between the vegetative and reproductive states by forming FUL-SVP and FUL-SOC1 heterodimers.74 The GSBRNA2T00044334001 gene on A03 and the GSBRNA2T00153879001 gene on chromosome A05 were homologous to APETALA 2 (AP2) of Arabidopsis, and play important roles in regulating flower development and specification of floral organ identity.75,76 The GSBRNA2T00055445001 gene on chromosome A02 was homologous to PROTEIN ARGININE METHYL TRANSFERASE 4A (PRMT4A) of Arabidopsis, which is known to directly induce the expression of floral repressor AGAMOUS-LIKE15 (AGL15) and to repress the transcription of floral activators such as SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1).77Nevertheless, many important flowering time genes in the genetic network were not found in the current study, such as FLC, SOC1, FRI, FD, SOC1 and LFY, among others. We think the main reason for this is that most of the accessions (257 of 300) in the association population are semi-winter varieties. Therefore, significantly trait-associated SNP loci were mainly from semi-winter types, and hence candidate genes for vernalization sensitivity would not be easy to find. For example, the central flowering time suppressor FLC in the vernalization pathway was not found in the candidate regions. In addition, the similar thermo-light conditions of the two environments make it difficult to explore flowering time candidate genes related to photoperiod and ambient temperature pathways. It is also possible that some important loci associated with flowering time genes were omitted due to failure to satisfy the high P value threshold (<4.96E10-7) used to identify true marker–trait associations.In this study, we investigated the phenotypes of four traits related to earliness of B. napus in two environments, based on 201,187 SNP markers developed from SLAF-seq. We performed a genome-wide association analysis of four traits across 300 rapeseed inbred lines, and 131 SNPs significantly associated with these traits were detected on 18 chromosomes using GLM and MLM analyses. Highly favourable alleles for promoting flowering time and prolonging the FP were excavated. Moreover, we identified 57 flowering time candidate genes in the vicinity of 33 SNP loci significantly associated with these traits. In summary, we present a series of exploratory analyses of earliness loci and flowering time candidate genes based on a GWAS. This GWAS approach showed great power in uncovering genetic variation in flowering time in B. napus, enhancing our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms controlling flowering in rapeseed. The elite alleles identified that contribute to earliness in B. napus can be directly applied to the targeted breeding of earliness in rapeseed, facilitating commercial rapeseed cultivation across greater regions worldwide.Conflict of interestNone declared.FundingThis work was financially supported by the National Science Foundation of China project ‘Genome-wide association analysis of flowering characters in Brassica napus’ (project number 31360342), Key R & D program of Jiangxi Province (code: 20152ACF60010), Science and Technology ‘Three Aid’ Project of Jiangxi Province (code: 20133BFB29005).

IntroductionThe pine wood nematode is responsible for an epidemic of pine wilt disease, which causes severe ecological and economic losses in Asia and Europe and more recently spreading to Mexico.1,2,Esteya vermicola (Ev) is the first recorded endoparasitic nematophagous (NP) fungus that attacks the pine wilt nematode (PWN; Bursaphelenchus xylophilus), which exhibits high infectivity.3 Certain volatile organic compounds (VOCs), a-pinene, ß-pinene, and camphor for PWN attraction were produced by Ev.4 Then lunate adhesive spores produced by Ev, whose concave surface has large surface area and thick adhesive layer, adhered to the cuticle of attracted nematode, and penetrated the cuticle of PWN. Afterwards, Ev colonized in the body cavity of the nematode and produced a great deal of mycelia and lunate spores on cadaver of nematode to attract new nematodes for next infection cycle5 (Fig. 1). Once lunate spore adheres to nematode cuticle, spores fall-off from the conidiophores and move with nematode. Ninety percent of inoculated PWN are infected within 24 h.3,6 The high infectivity suggests that Ev has great potential as biocontrol agent against PWN, but the evolution and mechanisms underlying infection are not clear.

The infected nematode shown is B. xylophilus.NP fungi are important microorganisms that can suppress the populations of plant-parasitic nematodes and maintain ecological balance and can be used as potential biological control factors.7 The genomes of NP fungi which have been sequenced include Arthrobotrys oligospora (Ao) with adhesive networks,8,Dactylellina haptotyla (Dh; synonyms Monacrosporium haptotylum) of knob-forming species,9,Drechmeria coniospora (Dc),10,11,Pochonia chlamydosporia (Pc)12,13 and Hirsutella minnesotensis (Hm) of endoparasitic fungus,14 and Drechslerella stenobrocha (Ds) with constricting ring.15 Despite the important roles of NP fungi in ecology, comprehensive and detailed analysis of similarity and difference based on the multiple genomic level was still lacking. Due to very different hosts categories and lifestyles of insect pathogenic (IP), plant pathogenic (PP) and NP fungi, it has been expected that their capacity to utilize the host's nutrition and to degrade carbohydrates and proteins would also differ, and that might be reflected in their genetic makeup and gene copy numbers at first. The availability of multiple whole genome data of NP, IP, and PP fungi has provided good opportunity to employ genome-wide surveys to investigate how natural selection shaped the evolution of NP fungi towards nematode host.The study aimed to decipher the putative genetic components involved in pathogenesis and evolution and to identify the molecular underpinnings underlying the establishment of predation relationship in NP fungi by performing comparative genomic and evolutionary analysis. Here, we reported the complete genome sequence of Ev based on the PacBio sequencing technology, comprehensively analyzed the differences among NP, PP, and IP fungi, and uncovered the genetic and evolutionary bases of NP fungi (Ao, Dh, Dc, Hm, Pc and Ev) by the numbers of pathogenic genes, secreted protein, secondary metabolism encoding genes, expanded gene families, and genes undergoing positive selection.2. Materials and methods2.1. Fungal strain and DNA preparationEv (CBS115803) was purchased from CBS and maintained on cornmeal agar. This fungus was originally isolated from Scolytus intricatus and its galleries in oak trees in Czech Republic.16 Mycelium was grown in liquid medium (potato dextrose broth) and incubated at 25 °C using a shaker at 150 rpm for 7 days. The mycelium (2g) was harvested by aseptic filtering and then grounded in liquid nitrogen. Genomic DNA was extracted using Qiagen Genomic-tip Kit 500 G (Cat No./ID: 10262, Germany) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. DNA quality was assessed by spectrophotometry and gel electrophoresis before library construction.2.2. SMRT PacBio sequencing and HGAP genome assemblyTwenty-five micrograms of high-molecular-weight Ev gDNA was used for the PacBio libraries constructing. A 20-kb insert SMRTbell library was generated using a 15 kb lower-end size selection protocol on the BluePippin (Sage Science). The genome was sequenced using 4 SMRT Cells and P6-C4 chemistry on the PacBio RS II platform (Pacific Biosciences). The Ev genome was assembled using the HGAP (version 2.3.0).17 First, the genome was preassembled with improved consensus accuracy. Then it was assembled through overlap consensus accuracy using Celera assembler and polished with Quiver to improve the site-specific consensus accuracy of the assembly. This Whole Genome project has been deposited at SRA database in NCBI under the accession SRP097009 (BioProject: SUB2318437; BioSample: SUB2318464).2.3. Gene prediction and functional annotationGene annotation was conducted by combining de novo and homology-based methods. Augustus18 and GeneMark-HMM19 were employed to de novo predict gene structures in the Ev genome, respectively. For homology-based prediction, protein sequences from three species [Grosmannia clavigera (Gc), Ophiostoma piceae (Op), Sporothrix schenckii (Ssch)] were initially mapped onto the Ev genome using tBlastn (E-value =1e-5). The homologous genome sequences were aligned against the matching protein using GeneWise20 for accurate spliced alignments. All the predictions were combined by EVidenceModeler (EVM)21 to produce a consensus gene sets. Gene functions were assigned according to the best matches derived from the alignments to proteins annotated in KOG, NR, SwissProt, and TrEMBL databases using Blastp22 (E-value =1e-5). Then the pathway in which the gene might be involved was annotated by KAAS23 according the KEGG database. Motifs and domains were annotated using InterProScan24 by searching against GO databases. Finally, the result annotated from the KOG, GO, KEGG, NR, Swissprot, and TrEMBL databases were combined to obtain the final annotation of Ev genome.2.4. Protein family classifications and prediction of pathogenicity-related genesThe carbohydrate active enzymes (CAZy) genes were identified using Blastp according to the CAZy database.25 Whole genome protein families were classified by Pfam analysis.26 The families of proteases were identified by Blastp searching against the MEROPS peptidase database release 9.4.27 Transporters were retrieved from the Transporter Classification Database (TCDB).28 Putative virulence factors were identified by searching against the pathogen–host interaction database (PHI),29 database of virulence factors in fungal pathogens (DFVF),30 and virulence factors of bacterial pathogens (VFDB). Peroxibase-encoding genes were predicted searching against Peroxidases database. Antibiotic resistance genes were identified according to Antibiotic Resistance Genes Database (ARDB).31 An E-value cut-off of 1.0E-5 was adopted to filter the BLAST results of the above databases. Twenty-one strains of fungi were used for the above BLAST analysis (Supplementary Table S1). SignalP 4.1 and TargetP were used to predict potential secreted proteins with default parameters. Secondary metabolite genes of six NP fungi, six IP, and six PP fungi were predicted by SMURF (Supplementary Table S1). The antiSMASH pipeline with HMM signatures was used to identify and annotate putative polyketide synthase (PKS), nonribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS), and terpene synthase (TPS) genes and other gene clusters about secondary metabolites and to predict the PKS and NRPS domain architecture. The whole genome dataset was subjected to analysis with default settings.32 The correlations between these 18 fungal species (IP, PP, and NP) and gene variables (PHI, TCDB, DFVF, and VFDB) were evaluated by correspondence analysis. All statistical analyses were performed with R project V.3.4.2.332.5. Phylogeny construction and estimation of divergence timeTwenty-three fungi species [Ev, Dc, Ao, Dh, Hm, Pc, Gc, Op, Ss, Sporothrix brasiliensis (Sb), Fusarium graminearum (Fg), Magnaporthe oryzae (Mo), Colletotrichum higginsianum (Ch), Verticillium dahliae (Vd), Zymoseptoria tritici (Zt), Cordyceps militaris (Cm), Beauveria bassiana (Bb), Metarhizium anisopliae (Ma), Metarhizium robertsii (Mr), Moelleriella libera (Ml), Sporothrix insectorum (Si), Neurospora crassa (Nc), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc)] were used for gene family clustering and phylogeny tree construction. Blastp was used to generate the pairwise protein sequence with similarity (E-value =1e-5). OrthoMCL34 was used to cluster similar genes by setting main inflation value 1.5 and other default parameters; 1203 single-copy gene families were extracted for the phylogenomic analysis. The protein sequences were aligned by Mafft35 and back translated into CDS alignments. Then, we eliminated poorly aligned positions and divergent regions of alignment of CDS sequences using Gblocks.36 Four-fold degenerate sites of all these single-copy genes in each species were extracted and concatenated them to be one supergene for phylogeny construction. Phylogenetic analyses using maximum likelihood (ML) method were conducted in RaxML version 8.2.437 and set Sc as out-group. The divergence time was estimated based on established phylogeny tree. Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm for Bayes estimation was adopted to estimate the neutral evolutionary rate and species divergence time using the program MCMCTree of the PAML package.38 The calibration times for divergence between Sc and Dh (460-726My), Dh and Zt (358-468Mya), Pc and Ch (194-888Mya) were obtained from the TimeTree database.392.6. Expansion and contraction of gene familiesGene families that have undergone expansions or contractions were identified using CAFE version 3.040 program with default parameters. The algorithm CAFE takes a matrix of gene family sizes in extant species as input and uses a probabilistic graphical model to ascertain the rate and direction of changes in gene family size across the given phylogenetic tree. The tree and expansion/contraction data were displayed using the iTOL web tool.412.7. Identification of orthologous genes and positively selected genes (PSGs)Orthologous genes in 23 species were identified. Genes with CDS length less than 450 bp were filtered. All-versus-all Blastp comparisons were used to identify clusters of homologous genes. For avoiding noise information in the Blastp output, orthologous clusters that contained more than 10 species were retained. The values of Ks and Ka substitution rates and the Ka/Ks ratio were estimated using the Codeml program in the PAML package.38 Codeml was used to calculate the selection pressure in the phylogenetic tree (P = 0.05).3. Results3.1. General features of Ev genomeEv genome was sequenced at approximately 100 × coverage, generating a total of 4.44 Gbp sequences. De novo assembly yielded Ev genome of 34.2 Mb in length with average 68.59 × coverage depth. The N50 sizes of 50 contigs and 42 scaffolds were 4.26 Mbp and 4.41 Mbp, respectively. Combined de novo and homology prediction produced 8,427 protein-coding genes. The detailed annotation results are given in the supporting information.3.2. Comparative analysis of gene involved in pathogenicity and virulenceTo identify functional gene categories characteristic of adaptation in killing nematode, we compared 21 genomes, including 6 IP fungi, 6 PP fungi, and 6 NP fungi and 3 genetically close species with Ev, Gc, and Si (Supplementary Table S1). The genome integrity and completeness of gene prediction assessed by BUSCO are shown in Supplementary Table S2. The genome integrities of the selected species were more than 95%, and the completeness of protein prediction was greater than 92%. The corresponding datasets based on different databases were shown in supporting information (Supplementary Table S3–S11). Extracellular adhesive proteins comprise GLEYA proteins, CFEM proteins, WSC-containing proteins and lectin, each of which was averagely the highest in NP genomes except CFEM (Supplementary Fig. S1), as well as total adhesion (Supplementary Fig. S2). Dh encoded the highest number of adhesive proteins GLEYA and WSC, whereas Ao encoded most abundant lectin among 21 analyzed fungi genomes (Supplementary Fig. S1a). However, our comparative analysis found that endoparasitic fungi (Ev, Dc, Pc and Hm) contain fewer extracellular adhesive proteins (Lectin and GLEYA) than adhesive networks producer Ao and adhesive knobs producer Dh (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). It was found that subtilases/peptidase S8 and subtilisin-like participating in lethal activity and the infection process of nematodes42–44 were averagely abundant in NP (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table S6). More subtilisin S8 and subtilisin-like were found in Ao and Dh than that in other NP fungi (Supplementary Table S6). NP fungi encoded averagely richer ankyrin repeat protein, while PP fungi encoded more leucine-rich repeat, tyrosinase, xylanase (Supplementary Fig. S4). IP fungi encoded the least cellulose, compared with PP, NP and CP fungi (Supplementary Fig. S6). Interestingly, all analyzed fungi except Z.tritici possessed appressorial penetration protein (PHI: 256), homologs of proteins in plant-pathogenic fungi Mo, especially in Ao (25) and Dh (28) most abundant (Supplementary Table S4).Chitinase is important for IP and egg-parasitic fungi to infect insect and nematode eggshell.45,46 IP fungi were most abundant averagely in enzymes catalyzing the decomposition of chitin (Supplementary Fig. S7). Pc, an egg-parasitic NP fungus, encoded the highest number of chitinase (159, CAZy) among NP fungi (Supplementary Fig. S7). Chitosanases (including GH5, GH7, GH8, GH46, GH75 and GH80) are another enzymes involved in chitin degradation and nematode parasitism.13 The analysis suggested that Ev had the most chitosanases, especially GH7; Ao encoded the richest GH75 (Supplementary Table S3 and Supplementary Fig. S7). IP, NP, and PP fungi also contained averagely more peptidase than CP fungi (Supplementary Fig. S8). IP fungi possessed most pkinase and enterotoxin-a, furthermore, and both pkinase and enterotoxin-a in IP fungi was significantly higher than that in PP fungi (Supplementary Figs S9 and S11). Based on Pfam database, IP had significantly more toxin genes than PP and CP fungi (Supplementary Fig. S10). The number of aspartic peptidase in NP and IP fungi was averagely higher than PP fungi (Supplementary Fig. S5). PP fungi genome encoded the richest CAZy enzymes (Supplementary Table S3), peroxidase (Supplementary Table S9), in particular, hemicellulose (Supplementary Fig. S12), G-protein receptor (Supplementary Fig. S12), pectate lyase (Supplementary Fig. S13) and cutinase (Supplementary Fig. S14), P450 (Supplementary Fig. S15). The important claim here was that the number of hemicellulose, G-protein receptor, and pectate lyase in PP fungi was significantly higher than that in IP fungi (Supplementary Figs S12b and S13b). Moreover, the content of cutinase in PP group was significantly greater than that in IP and CP group (Supplementary Fig. S14b). It suggested that PP fungi evolved to adapt to higher carbohydrate content in plants.We identified 231 transporter superfamily in all 21 fungi species. Ev, Hm and Pc genome encodes a large number of transporters (1,482, 1,546, and 1,986, respectively; Supplementary Table S10). Remarkably, Ev and Pc had more carbon (72, 90), iron (23, 19) and vitamin transporters (81, 55) than do other NP fungi (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S10). The numbers of genes encoding allantoate transporters, and vitamin or iron in Ev were the greatest and second highest among all 21 fungi, respectively (Fig. 2). Ammonium and urea import capacity of Ev was higher than other NP, IP, and PP fungi. Therefore, Ev shows an increased genetic potential in terms of vitamin, iron, and nitrogen uptake. This could be an important mechanism for perturbing nematode metabolism and ultimately causing nematode death. It indicated that the transport capacity of ammonium, nucleobase, and nucleoside in CP group was very strong (Supplementary Fig. S16). The number of oligopeptide transporter in IP group was averagely higher than other groups and significantly higher than that of in NP group (Supplementary Fig. S16). This implied the great potential of absorbing oligopeptide of nitrogen sources in IP fungi. Heatmap of vitamin, iron, saccharides and nitrogen transporter-encoded genes in 21 fungi.Heatmap of vitamin, iron, saccharides and nitrogen transporter-encoded genes in 21 fungi.Strikingly, all 21 fungi contained a wide array of antibiotic resistance genes. The total number of antibiotic resistance genes in IP fungi (207) was the richest, followed by PP fungi (201), and NP fungi (174) (Supplementary Table S8 and Supplementary Fig. S17). The substances encoded by these genes were likely to play roles in competition with bacteria in insect, nematode, and plant, then pathogenic fungi can colonize in their host. Among antibiotic synthesizing genes, macrolide transporter-encoding genes and multidrug-encoding genes were most abundant in each group (Supplementary Table S8 and Supplementary Fig. S17).3.3. Secreted proteins and small secreted proteinsSecretion signals were predicted in 21 fungi. The results showed that PP had the highest number of secreted proteins (SPs) and small secreted proteins (SSPs; < 300 amino acids), followed by NP and IP fungi (Supplementary Table S12). Among the 21 analyzed fungi, Mo had amazing ability to produce SSP (about one-tenth of the total protein). Among NP fungi, Pc had the most SPs and SSPs, followed by Dh, Ao and Hm (Supplementary Table S12). Out of the 1,318 proteins predicted to be secreted by Ev, 46.7% can be ascribed known function. Of these 397 SSPs of Ev, 302 was annotated into NR database, but only 131 (33.0%) were annotated with known function; 10 of 397 SSPs was related with transporters; 48 of 397 SSPs (12.1%) was related with pathogen-host interaction based on PHI database; and 180 of 397 SSPs (45.3%) was found listed in Pfam database.The possible pathogenic-related SPs are shown in Fig. 3. NP fungi were rich in SPs of subtilisin or subtilisin-like protease, lectin, WSC, and iron transporter. Only Ev was predicted to produce secretory cellobiose dehydrogenase in NP fungi. Ev was remarkable in SPs of putative aspartic protease, glucanase and endoglucanase, laccase and cellobiose dehydrogenase. It was worth noting that the number of secreted oligopeptide transporter and aspartic proteinase was remarkably high in endoparasitic fungi Ev, Dc, Pc, and Hm. The important SPs involving pathogenicity in Ev were comparable to those in Mo and Ch, such as P450, laccase, and cellobiose dehydrogenase. Heatmap of possible pathogenic related SPs in 21 fungi.Heatmap of possible pathogenic related SPs in 21 fungi.3.4. Secondary metabolite analysisPP fungi can produce diverse secondary metabolites (SMs) that aid in pathogenicity.47–49 However, the extent and distribution of the capacity for secondary metabolite synthesis have not been investigated in NP group. Furthermove, there was no comparative analysis about the capacity for secondary metabolite among groups (IP, NP, and PP) before. SMURF predicted that endoparasitic fungi (Hm, Pc, Dc, and Ev) had more genes encoding secondary metabolites than species of adhesive networks and knob-forming species (Ao and Dh) (Supplementary Table S13). Hm had the highest number of gene clusters and core genes involved in biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, followed by Pc among NP group. PKS and NRPS synthesis genes in Pc (195, 156) and Hm (299, 238) were more abundant than that of other analyzed NP fungi. Especially endoparasitic NP fungi had tremendous potential for biosynthesis of secondary metabolites that act as toxins or signals in the interactions between fungus and host. The rich unknown secondary metabolism in NP fungi is worthy of further research and exploration. Furethermore, Mr and Ma of IP fungi, and Ch and Mo of PP fungi also had great capacity for biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, which possibly greatly enhanced their disease-causing abilities.3.5. Insights into pathogenic differentiation leading to different hosts categoriesTo assess pathogenic differentiation leading to different host classification, we performed correspondence analysis based on multiple large datasets (Supplementary Tables S3–S11). It was hypothesized that pathogenic fungi belonging to the same host categories with similar nutritional mode, would be clustered together. Figure 4 shows separation result of three clusters (PP, IP, and NP) according to gene variables of PHI genes, membrane transport proteins (TCDB), fungal virulence factors (DFVF), virulence factors of bacterial pathogens (VFDB). The species of IP fungi were clustered except Si species, and so did the six PP species. However, the distribution of NP species was dispersive, and Ev, Dc and Pc were always clustered with PP, IP fungi, respectively. CAZy, peroxidises, and antibiotic resistance genes failed to separate IP and PP fungi (figures not shown). Also, the analysis suggestsed that the difference in pathogenicity genes or membrane transport proteins was possibly the important factors to drive pathogenic differentiation and adaptation to different host categories. Endoparasitic fungal Ev, Dc, Pc and Hm, which were very different from Ao and Dh, were likely to be the intermediate type between the IP and PP fungi.

Phylogeny and divergence time estimatesOrthoMCL was used to identify gene orthologs. Totally 253,363 genes from 23 species were used for gene family clustering analysis. Finally, 20,524 gene families containing 206,300 total genes from 23 species were generated, out of which 1,203 possessed a strict single-copy orthologous relationship. The phylogenomic tree was constructed using concatenated nucleotide sequences of 1,203 single-copy orthologous genes to infer NP fungal phylogenetic relationships in the context of other fungal taxa. It indicated that Ev diverged from plant-associated Gc about 135 million years ago (Mya), and Ev and Gc had closer genetic relationship (Fig. 5). The phylogenetic analysis showed that the relationship of Ao and Dh in NP fungi were closely related, and the divergence of the two species took place around 212 Mya. Dc, Pc and Hm had a close genetic relationship with IP fungal Metarhizium, which was consistent with previous phylogenetic analysis results.10–14Phylogenetic tree and divergence time estimates. The numbers at nodes in the tree are the divergence times from the present (Million years ago, Mya). The nodes with red dot represent the reliable calibration time of the divergence.

Gene family and gene family expansionGene duplication and protein family expansion are important genomic mechanisms that shape the evolution of pathogenic fungi.50 CAFE analysis was performed to assess the gene family variations; 276 gene families were expanded in Ev, 1,170 families had undergone contraction (Fig. 6). We found a marked expansion of transporter genes in Ev. Among the 276 expanded gene families in Ev, 10.7% (37) was related to transporters or permeases, which was the highest among all the fungi analyzed (Supplementary Table S14), while the proportions were less than 2.4% and 6.8% in other five NP fungi and other analyzed species, respectively (Supplementary Table S14). It was surprising that the proportion of expanded gene families of transporters in Ev was much higher than that of the other analyzed species. The transporters of expanded gene families in Ev occurred mainly for the carbon source, nitrogen source, iron and vitamin transport, such as ABC transporter, sugar transporter, iron permease, urea transporter, allantoate/allantoale permease, vitamin H transporter and amino acid permease (Supplementary Table S15), which provide the basis for effectively absorbing nutrition of nematodes. Gene families involving in aflatoxin efflux pump had undergone expansion in Ev (Supplementary Table S16). Gene families about endo-beta-glucanase, which catalyse hydrolyzing O-glycosyl compounds, were substantially expanded in Ev compared with other fungi species. Important pathogenicity-related gene families were founded expanded, including peptidase S41, cellobiohydrolase and laccase. Gene family expansions and contractions.

Blue represents the proportion of gene families no changed in the current species or branch. Orange in pie charts represents the proportion of the gene families combined change across lineages. Six NP fungi are marked with red.The six NP fungi in total shared 3,717 gene families, but no expansion gene families in common were observed (Fig. 7a and b). Surprisingly, we found that Ao and Dh shared the largest set of gene families (8,078) through pair comparison, followed by Pc and Hm with 6,807 gene families. Beyond that, the two species (Pc and Hm) with similar nematicidal mechanism (endoparasitism) shared the most expanded gene families (132). Substantial differences were observed in species-specific gene families among six fungi (Ev 1,027, Hm 650, Ao 244, Dh 223, Dc 168, Pc 1,581) in magnitude. The ratio of species-specific gene family to the total gene family was the highest in Pc (16.6%), followed by Ev (14.2%) and Hm 8.1% (Supplementary Table S17). The ratio of species-specific expanded gene family to the total expanded gene family was 71–86.8% among NP fungi (Supplementary Table S17). NP fungi contained more gene families not found in other pathogenic fungi (Supplementary Fig. S18) indicating their unknown functional diversification.

(a) Venn diagram of gene families; (b) Venn diagram of expanded gene families; (c) Venn diagram of orthologous genes of positive selection; (d) Selected orthologous genes of positive selection. ‘1’means undergoing positive selection; ‘0’means no positive selection.We further compared expanded gene families in 23 species to detect gene family evolution (Supplementary Table S16). Subtilisin-like gene family in NP fungi (Dh and Hm) and IP fungi (Mr) were expanded, except that in PP species. Genes encoding chitinase, aspartic proteinase and Wsc domain protein had undergone expansion in NP and PP group, but not in IP group. Furthermore, peptidase S41 family protein exhibited expansion in NP fungi (Ev and Dc) and IP fungi (Ma). Intriguingly, gene families about trehalose metabolism expanded greatly in Hm. Sabine Fillinger et al. found trehalose rapidly degraded upon induction of conidial germination and was required for the acquisition of tolerance to a variety of stresses in Aspergillus nidulans.51 Compared with other analyzed species, there was a major expansion in gene families related to allantoate and iron transport, laccase and endoglucanase in Ev (Supplementary Table S16). The ratio of expansion gene families to total gene families in Hm and Pc peaked at an incredible 11.0% and 8.8%, respectively, while that in other four NP fungi was no more than 4% (Supplementary Table S17), which partly explained the differences in genomic size of these species.3.8. Positive selectionPositive selection, acting in the evolution of functionally important gene families, is an important driving force for pathogens in adaptation to a pathogenic lifestyle and host specialization.52–54 Identifying targets of positive selection will help to annotate the genome functionally and to elucidate evolutionary processes. Signatures of positive selection specify functionally important regions of the genome.55 Based on the established phylogeny and 10,610 high-confidence orthologues identified among 23 species, positively selected genes (PSGs) of six NP fungi and PP fungal Gc was detected. Dh and Ao had more PSGs (256, 247) than endoparasitic NP (Ev 234, Dc 102, Hm 80, Pc 64) (Supplementary Table S18); 97 PSGs in Ev, this was the highest count among 7 analyzed species, belonged to putative PHI genes. Moreover, Ev had the largest number of unique positive selection genes (78) (Fig. 7c). The number of PSGs encoding transcription factors were the most highest in Dh (27) all over analyzed seven species (Supplementary Table S18). Six NP fungi did not share orthologous gene undergoing positive selection. Corresponding to the need for nitrogen, orthologous gene (ortholog00083) involving in nitrogen permease regulator have been subject to a positive selection pressure in Ev (P = 0.02) to adapt to nematode. Subtilisin-like proteinase (ortholog00552) was also under positive selection in Ao, Dh and Hm (Fig. 7d). Orthologous genes related to aspartic endopeptidase, aminopeptidase, and cytochrome P450 reductase revealed positive selection in NP fungi (Fig. 7d).4. Discussion4.1. NP fungi encoded rich secondary metabolites and antibioticsSecondary metabolites involving in host–pathogen interactions may protect the fungus from predation and allow an organism to survive in its ecological niche.56 Secondary metabolisms of beauvericin,57 and bassianolide,58 and destruxin59 in insect pathogens were insecticidal. Similarly, secondary metabolites in NP fungi can kill nematodes.60 Endoparasitic fungi had very rich repertories of secondary metabolism genes compared with nematode trapping fungi implying endoparasitic fungal great potential for killing nematodes. One of the most important questions about the ecology of NP fungi is how they defends the nematode cadaver against different microbial competitors. NP fungi, especially Pc and Hm, encoded a large number of polyketide and nonribosomal peptide synthases which could be part of the biosynthetic pathway of antibiotics. Besides, the phenomenon that NP fungi possess a set of antibiotic resistance genes is a general mechanism responsible for resistance to antibiotics from other microbe. It was suggested that antibiotic and fungal secondary metabolites displayed antagonistic effect against other microbial competitors during colonizing nematode cadaver.4.2. The abundance and evolution of pathogenic genes in NP fungiAdhesive proteins accumulating on the outside surface of adhesive traps or spores of NP fungi play vital roles for those fungi to adhere to nematode cuticles.7 Adhesive materials may harbour many secreted virulence-related proteins.61 Comparative analysis showed that NP fungi contained abundant pathogenicity genes encoding subtilisins and subtilisin-like protease, of which the nematotoxic activity has been proved. Transcripts encoding subtilisins were highly expressed by Ao, Dh, and Hm during infection.9,62 Previous studies have proved that subtilisins are important virulence factors involved in the penetration and digestion of host cuticles in IP and NP fungi.63–65 We found that tyrosinase-encoding gene was the most abundant present in NP fungi. It has been demonstrated that tyrosinases involving in synthesis of melanin in some fungi were highly upregulated in M. haptotylum (Dh) during infection9 and participated in pathogenic process.66 But these genes encoding these proteins were not evenly distributed across NP species, and the number of these genes in different species varied widely. These wide differences in number of pathogenic genes may be a manifestation of diverse pathogenic mechanism of NP fungi.Subtilisin-like proteases as virulence factors function during fungal pathogenic progress in IP fungi,67,68 NP fungi,64,69–71 and other parasite fungi.72 Our results demonstrated that subtilisin-like serine proteases as SPs underwent expansion and positive selection in NP group. Aspartic protease, which was expressed by many pathogenic ascomycetes during infection,9 was subjected to positive selection during the evolution in NP fungi. Nitrogen permease regulator, as well as some proteolytic enzymes, was under forward selection, implying the importance of nitrogen sources for NP fungi. Cytochrome P450s play various roles in secondary metabolism and involve in biodegradation of lignin and various xenobiotic compounds.73 Our results indicated that PP and IP contained richer P450s than NP group. Nevertheless, P450 and P450 reductase underwent positive selection in NP fungi but not in PP fungal Gc (Fig. 7d). Therefore, P450s should be functionally important for NP in adaptation to pathogenic lifestyle.4.3. Abundance of transporter in Ev genomeWe identified abundant transporters, which underwent expansion in Ev. Monosaccharide transporter (Hxt1), also as sensor, is required for virulence of the maize pathogen Ustilago maydis and is important for fungal development during the pathogenic stage of the fungus.74 Pyruvate uptake transporter (BcMctA) is also required for pathogenicity in Botrytis cinerea, and disruption of BcmctA significantly reduced the virulence of B. cinerea on cucumber and tomato leaves.75 Phytopathogenic bacteria and fungi can use iron uptake systems to multiply in their hosts and to promote infection,76 and iron transporters have been found to play a critical role in virulence of both animal- and plant-pathogenic fungi,77 such as siderophores of Aspergillus fumigatus and high affinity iron permease of Rhizopus oryzae, which play critical roles in the expression of virulence.78,79 Similarly, these transporters could well take part in pathogenicity during infecting nematodes. In addition, based on a wealth of transporters (Supplementary Table S10), it was possible that NP fungi, especially endoparasitic fungal Ev, Pc, and Hm could be more efficiently utilize nematode nutrients compared with other NP fungi.4.4. Endo-beta-glucanase in Ev genome was highly expandedComparative analysis revealed endo-beta-glucanase encoding genes in Ev genome were highly expanded. Endo-beta-glucanase likely plays a role in degrading glucans polymers from themselves cell wall or their host nematodes. Endo-beta-glucanases were identified as parasitism genes in plant-parasitic nematode.80 Extracellular glucanase secreted by Acremonium persicinum was considered to participate in the degradation of an extracellular storage glucan.81 Glucanases produced by some Trichoderma species has been recognized as the key enzymes in the lysis of cell walls during their mycoparasitic action against phytopathogenic fungi.82,83 Highly expanded endo-beta-glucanase in Ev genome possibly functions as parasitism, but further research is needed to determine the possibility.4.5. No a- and ß-pinene monoterpenoid synthase-encoding genes in Ev genomeInterestingly, the host pine of PWN, vector Monochamus alternatus of PWN, and NP fungal Ev, belonging to three different kingdoms, all attract nematodes through volatile chemicals: a- and ß-pinene.4,7,84,85 Due to Ev' s capacity to attract PWN by volatile chemicals a- and ß-pinene4 and the fact that Ev host intracellular bacteria,86 it remains vague whether the fungus itself produced the compounds. Annotation results of Ev genome revealed that there were no a- and ß-pinene monoterpenoid synthase-encoding genes. Here we hypothesize that the endobacteria produce the monoterpene that attracts PWN. The next step for whole genome sequencing of this endobacteria will further verify the authenticity of the endobacteria producing the monoterpenoid that attracts nematodes.5. ConclusionsWe sequenced the genome of Ev and embarked upon a comparative genomics analysis. These results indicated that NP fungi was distinguished from other pathogenic fungi in terms of pathogenic genes sets. Despite genetic predispositions for killing nematode, the microscopic mechanism was different in NP fungi. Our analysis elucidated a repertoire of genes in endoparasitic NP fungi distinct from those of other NP fungi. The availability of the first Ev genome sequencing, annotation and evolution analysis was an important advance in helping to decipher its pathogenesis. The results would facilitate our comprehension of the genomic features of NP fungi for adaptation to nematodes. Furthermore, the results also set out a solid theoretical foundation for further research and application of these NP fungi as biological control agents.The authors would like to thank Chengshu Wang (Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, CAS) and reviewers for suggestion for the manuscript modification.

IntroductionThe mechanism of sex determination in fish has attracted a lot of biologist’s attention, as this mechanism has great implications both in theory and practice.1 Fish are species of original vertebrate evolved from parthenogenesis to sexual reproduction, and their sex determination systems have showed to be highly diverse and complex.2–4 Different sex determination systems have been reported in some closely related species or even within the same fish genus.5 Studies of sex determination in fish provided insights into the genetic mechanisms of sex determination and origin and evolution of sex chromosomes.6,7 Many farmed fish exhibit significant sexual dimorphism in body size, growth rate and first time of sexual maturation.2,8 Therefore, understanding the genetic basis of sex determination is critical for the implementation of breeding and production programs and sex control,9 and it can greatly add value by culturing monosex populations in some fish species.6,10 To date, sex determination genes have been identified in few farmed fish species, such as rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss),11 medaka (Oryzias latipes),12 tiger pufferfish (Takifugu rubripes),13 half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis)14 and Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus).15Sex-specific markers are prerequisite for understanding the mechanisms of sex determination, identification of sex-determining genes and uncovering genetic architecture related to sex differences.2,16–18 During the past few decades, different approaches have been used to find sex-specific DNA sequences in aquaculture fishes. Traditional methods such as amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) have been successfully used for the identification of sex-specific markers in more than 20 aquaculture fishes.10,19–24 With the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies, many new methods have been developed for screening genes or sex-associated DNA fragments. For example, sex-specifically expressed genes by RNA-seq,25–29 QTL mapping for sex-linked single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers using high-density SNP linkage maps through restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-Seq),30–34 identification of sex-related markers between several sexed individuals using RAD-Seq without generating linkage maps,35–38 and detecting sex-specific sequences by whole genome sequencing.14,39–41Bighead carp and silver carp not only are important freshwater edible fish native to East Asia but also have been introduced into many other countries for improving water quality and human consumption.42,43 The global production of bighead carp and silver carp reached 3.4 and 4.9 million tons in 2015, respectively (FAO). The age of first maturation in bighead carp and silver carp normally takes 4 to 5 years or more in central and south China and the incapability of determining the gender before sex maturation has brought troubles for aquaculture. Thus, a sex-specific marker is desirable to discriminate male and female samples at an early life stage of the two carps. The aim of this study is to identify sex-specific markers in the two carps and then apply these sex markers to perform molecular sexing and verification in large number of samples including mature and young fish and progenies from gynogenetic and full-sib families.2. Materials and methods2.1. Experimental fishAll experimental procedures about dealing with the fish in this study were approved by the Committee for Animal Experiments of the Institute of Hydrobiology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, China. The methods used in this study were carried out in accordance with the Laboratory Animal Management Principles of China. The rearing activities of bighead carp in Wuhan, Hubei were approved by the owner of the pond.A total of 136 sexually matured bighead carp (brood fish) were sampled from the Zhangdu Lake Fish Farm (Wuhan, China), all of which were harvested from the middle Yangtze River and sampled at least 6 years old. The sex phenotype of each sire and dam was individually confirmed by collecting its gametes (sperm or eggs) released in artificial reproduction in May 2014. Artificial gynogenesis was performed in bighead carp according to a previous method.44 In total, 160 young progenies from three diploid gynogenetic families were sampled after 6-month culture in a pond for the detection of genetic sexes in the gynogenesis of bighead carp. In addition, 579 young progenies from three full-sib families were sampled after 6-month culture for the detection of sex ratio. The 16 silver carp samples used to verify the markers were sampled from Shishou Fish Farm (Shishou, China), and they were caught from the Yangtze River when they were young and then reared in the farm until sexually mature. The sex of these fish was confirmed by collecting gametes released. Fin clips from each of the above mature or young carp were collected and preserved in 95% alcohol at 4 °C. Genomic DNA were extracted from alcohol-preserved fin tissues following a standard phenol–chloroform protocol.45 The quality and quantity of extracted DNA were checked by NanoDrop2000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, USA) and 1% agarose gel electrophoresis.2.2. 2b-RAD sequencing and male-specific tags filteringTo identify potential male-specific sequences in a bighead carp genome, we used a modified 2b-RAD genotyping method to find putative SNP loci that may be associated with each sex. In this study, we constructed 2b-RAD libraries for five sires and five dams of bighead carp with known sex phenotypes (brood fish). A total of 250 ng of genomic DNA from each fish was digested with BcgI restriction enzyme (New England Biolabs, USA) at 37 °C for 4 h. The digestion products were heat-inactivated for 20 min at 65 °C, and then linked to adapter 1 and adapter 2 at 16 °C overnight. The linked fragments were amplified with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA Polymerase (Thermo Scientific, USA) using a set of four primers by which sample-specific barcode and sequencing primers were introduced. After 14 cycles of amplification, the library was obtained by purifying the products at ~170 bp via retrieval from 8% polyacrylamide gels. Each library was pooled with an equal amount to make a final library that was sequenced in a lane of the Illumina HiSeq 2500 SE50 platform (Illumina, USA). Rawdata were deposited in NCBI SRA PRJNA401338.Reads with low-quality bases were removed before the following analyses were carried out. Consensus tags were constructed for each sample with Stacks 1.3146 with parameter ‘-m 4 -p 6 -M 1 -N 2 -d –r’. After that, with Perl scripts, we extracted male-specific tags present in all five sires but not in any of the five dams. The male-specific tags were then mapped to a female bighead carp genome (Shunping He, unpublished data), and those tags failing to align to the female reference genome were considered as putative male-specific tags.2.3. Re-sequencing and screening of male-specific genomic scaffoldsBecause the male-specific tags obtained from 2b-RAD sequencing method were only 32 bp in length, which are too short to design primers for PCR experiment, we sequenced a whole genome of a male bighead carp, Arp7, which was one of the five dams used in the screening of male-specific tags. The sequencing library was constructed with small insert fragments (300–500 bp), and sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 4000 sequencing platform using 150 bp paired-end reads. The raw reads were filtered by removing adaptor sequences, contamination and low-quality reads. Then those filtered reads were mapped to a female bighead carp genome (Shunping He, unpublished data), and SOAPdenovo247 (version 2.04) was used to assembly these unmapped reads to male-specific regions. The male-specific 2b-RAD reads were aligned to the male-specific regions, and the targeted scaffolds were regarded as putative male-specific scaffolds.2.4. Development and validation of male-specific SCAR markersThree sequence characterized amplified region (SCAR) markers were designed based on each male-specific scaffolds using Primer Premier 5 (Premier Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA, USA). Then PCR was used to validate the sex specificity of male-specific SCAR markers. PCR reactions were carried with a total volume of 25 µl, containing 50 ng of template DNA, 2.5 µl of 10× reaction buffer, 0.75 U of Taq polymerase (TaKaRa, Japan), 0.8 µl of dNTP (2.5 mmol/l), 0.8 µl of forward and reverse primer mixture (2.5 µmol/l each) and water to the final volume. PCR programs were as follows: an initial denaturation step of 94 °C for 5 min; then 36 cycles of 94 °C for 35 s, 50 °C annealing for 35 s, and 72 °C for 40 s; and finally an extension step of 72 °C for 8 min. The amplified products were separated by 1% agarose or 8% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.Eight male and eight female matured fish with known sexes were first used to verify the authenticity of SCAR markers by PCR/gel electrophoresis assay. Then PCR products were sequenced via direct Sanger sequencing method to confirm the identity of the nucleotide sequences of sex markers with the sequences of male-specific scaffolds. To further validate that those SCAR markers are truly male-specific, and not simply specific to only several individuals, 120 matured fish (broodstock population) with known phenotypic sexes were used to verify the detection efficiency (accuracy) of those SCAR markers. Moreover, SCAR markers were also verified by 160 gynogenetic diploid progenies of bighead carp from three dams.2.5. Analysis of sex ratio in full-sib familiesThe male-specific markers were used to assess sex ratio (female to male) in three full-sib families of bighead carp (6 months old), which contained 90, 166, 324 young offspring, respectively. Chi-square tests were performed to determine the fitness of sex ratio (female/male) to the expected 1 : 1.2.6. Genome walkingThe male-specific contigs did not have corresponding regions in female bighead carp genome (Shunping He, unpublished data), so several rounds of genome walking experiments were carried out to gain flanking sequences of the male-specific contigs. Genome walking was performed using Universal GenomeWalker 2.0 kit (Clontech) in accordance with the user’s manual. The primers used in genome walking were summarized in Table 3. Male-specific primers used for SCAR markersMale-specific primers used for SCAR markers3. Results3.1. Male-specific 2b-RAD tagsTo find sex-specific markers in bighead carp, we used 2b-RAD sequencing to genotype five male and five female samples, which were within the 136 brood fish. In total, 30,941,847 raw reads and 26,732,738 high-quality reads were obtained after filtering low-quality reads (Table 1). A total of 16,137,193 high-quality reads were obtained from five female samples and 10,595,545 high-quality reads from five male samples. Each individual gets 1,367,315 to 5,162,352 high-quality reads, and the average amount of data is 2,673,274 reads per sample. After clustering, the tags per sample ranged from 59,506 to 70,463 with an average of 63,699. Average coverage depth per tag among samples varied from 22.28× to 86.75× (mean 42.69×). The high-sequencing coverage depth guarantees the high reliability of sex-specific sequences generated in this study. With Perl scripts, we extracted those male-specific tags presented in all five males but not in any of five females. Finally, we got 13 tags presented in all five male fish but not in any of five female fish. Reads supporting the 13 tags in all male samples were summarized in Table 2. Summary of 2b-RAD data for 10 bighead carp parentsSummary of 2b-RAD data for 10 bighead carp parentsInformation of 13 male-specific tagsInformation of 13 male-specific tagsWe mapped these 13 potential male-specific tags to the female bighead carp genome sequence (Shunping He, unpublished data), and found 10 of them were mapped to a female genome. Among them, five had SNPs in the BcgI digestion recognition site (N10CGAN6TGCN10) of the female genome, and other five tags remained the same sequences as their corresponding female sequences. Therefore, only three tags without any mapping were male-specific 2b-RAD tags (Table 2).3.2. Mapping male-specific tags to male-specific genomic regionsSince male-specific 2b-RAD tags were too short to design primers for PCR amplification, one of the male individuals was subject to short-reads de novo sequencing. We got 48,157,939 pairs of 150 bp Illumina pair-end reads for this sample. After filtering low-quality reads, 42,830,738 pair-end reads were left and mapped to a female bighead carp genome. As mapped reads were located in regions identical between the male and female genome, we only kept 4,417,710 pairs of unmapped reads for de novo assembly of male-specific regions of bighead carp. Finally, we got 298,474 scaffolds with a total size of 79.0 Mb.To get the flanking sequences of the three tags, we mapped them to assembled male-specific scaffolds. For the tag ref-22847, it was mapped to scaffold37502 (907 bp) with 100% identity. For the tag ref-18178, it was mapped to scaffold8218 (602 bp) of identical sequences. For the tag ref-804, we could not find any mapping results in the scaffolds of the male genome. Therefore, scaffold37502 and scaffold8218 were candidate male-specific sequences in the bighead carp.3.3. Development and validation of male-specific markersThree primers were designed for each male-specific scaffolds, and then their authenticity was verified by PCR between mature males and females (Table 3, Supplementary File S2). Three markers from scaffold37502 showed consistent amplification of fragments in all eight mature males, while none of the eight mature females amplified those bands (Fig. 1). For scaffold8218, the PCR products from all three primers showed no difference between male and female samples (Supplementary Fig. S3). In order to detect universality of the male-specific markers, the three markers from scaffold37502 were tested in another 120 mature bighead carp fish, and the authenticity of these sexing tests was 100% (Supplementary Fig. S1). These results strongly support high reliability of the male-specific markers in other larger bighead carp samples, which confirmed that these loci are truly male-specific. These male-specific markers were also validated in 160 offspring from three diploid gynogenetic families, and all fish were identified as females (Supplementary Fig. S2). The male PCR products were Sanger sequenced, and the nucleotide sequences were consistent with the male genomic sequences in scaffold37502. However, three markers from scaffold8218 showed no difference when amplified between female and male individuals. Therefore, only scaffold37502 was confirmed as a male-specific sequence in bighead carp.

The DL 2000 DNA marker is shown on the left.We blasted the male-specific sequences of scaffold37502 against the female genome of bighead carp, but no homologous sequences were found. Then we blasted the male-specific sequences of the scaffold37502 against the NCBI NT database, and we could not find sequence alignment of this region to any other vertebrate genomes. The earlier results indicated that these sequences from male-specific region are unique to the bighead carp male genome.3.4. Genetic sex identification in full-sib familiesAfter verifying the authenticity of male-specific markers, they were used to analyse the ratio of females to males in three full-sib families of young bighead carp containing 579 offspring, and the total segregation ratio of females to males was 295 : 284 (1.04 : 1) (Table 4) in all three families. The female-to-male segregation ratio of these three families were 46 : 44 (1.05 : 1), 82 : 84 (0.98 : 1) and 295 : 284 (1.04 : 1), respectively. Chi-square testing showed that the female-to-male ratio of all three families did not have significant differences with the 1 : 1 separation ratio (P = 1).

Genome walking and more sex-specific markersAfter five rounds of genome walking (two for the upstream and three for the downstream sequences), the corresponding male genomic fragments were extended. The designed walking primers and the adapter primers were summarized in Table 3. Based on the amplified fragments from males, an 8,661 bp of male-specific sequences were assembled from the male-amplified fragments (Supplementary File S1), and the whole sequence was submitted to NCBI at accession MG668998. According to the male-specific sequences, more sex-specific markers were designed, such as ArS-9-10, ArS-9-11, ArS-9-13, ArS-9-14 and ArS-9-15. The PCR results from different sex with these primers further identified that this region is male-specific region in the bighead carp genome (Fig. 2, Table 3). We blasted the genome walking sequence against the female genome, but no corresponding homologous sequence was found.

Genetic sex identification in silver carpIn order to verify the presence of the sex markers in other species of the genus Hypophthalmichthys, the designed SCAR primers were also amplified in eight female and eight male silver carp and showed the same results with bighead carp (Fig. 3). We also found that the PCR results matched with phenotype with a 100% overall accuracy. The same amplification results were found both on males and females of these two species, and sequences of PCR products of silver carp were also similar with that of bighead carp.

The results can also help us understand the sex-determination systems as well as origin and evolution of sex chromosomes. However, unlike the mammals or birds with significant difference in sex chromosomes, large differentiated genomic regions are uncommon in fish.48 Thus, it is always difficult to screen these sex-specific regions successfully. Traditional molecular marker technologies such as RAPD and AFLP have proved to be simple and effective ways to find sex markers in fish,21–24,49 but in some species they failed to detect any sex-specific markers.50–52In the last decade, the development of NGS technology allowed researchers to quickly and conveniently obtain millions of sequences at the genomic level, and it rendered new opportunities for sex difference analysis between males and females.37,53 With the combination of NGS and restriction digestion enzymes, RAD-Seq offers the possibility for generating thousands of SNPs in a short time, which could be used for identification of sex-linked SNP markers or sex-specific DNA sequences and for the construction of high-density linkage maps and sex QTL mapping.32,36,38,53 RAD-Seq has been successfully used for sex-specific marker identification in a variety of species using only multiple male and female individuals, which proved to be an efficient way for screening of sex-specific markers.35–38,53 But RAD-Seq always misses some of the digestion sites, which can cause the failure of identification of sex-specific markers.Compared to other RAD-Seq methods, the 2b-RAD method used in this study has more advantages compared to traditional RAD-Seq. First, it can screen nearly every restriction site at the whole genome level whereas other RAD-Seq methods can only get a subset of total sites due to the multiple time size selection for efficient PCR amplification and sequencing.54,55 The average sequence coverage for each site in 2b-RAD is usually more than 40× coverage, which provided accuracy of 2b-RAD genotyping and high reliability of generated tags.55 Second, the sequences of 2b-RAD are easy for sex-specific 2b-RAD reads identification, which is very convenient for PCR verification. With all of these positive attributes, the 2b-RAD method is very suitable for sex-specific markers and sex-determining regions identification. Here, for the first time, we utilize the 2b-RAD and genome re-sequencing to efficiently and accurately identify the sex-specific markers in genomes of two closely related species, bighead carp and silver carp. Our study proved that combining 2b-RAD genotyping and genome re-sequencing is a very powerful and promising tool for sex-specific markers’ identification. This strategy of SCAR-based PCR detection in this study is the first protocol successfully amplifying the Y-specific fragment in bighead carp and silver carp.The studies of sex-determination in fish would contribute to the understanding of the origin and evolution of sex chromosomes.1,3 Although most fish species lack visually heteromorphic sex chromosomes, some species have evolved sex-determining regions (genes) and even nascent sex chromosome.12,23,30,32,34,38 Based on the 2b-RAD sequencing and male fish re-sequencing, we got a scaffold spanning over 900 bp, which is totally associated with Y-specific fragments of bighead carp, suggesting that this scaffold is located on the Y chromosome or nascent Y-linked region. We extend this scaffold to 8,661 bp by genome walking, but no homologous sequences corresponding to this region was found in the female genome. This might be a significant difference in male and female sex-determining regions in bighead carp. The diversity between male and female fish in this sex-related region may lead to recombination suppression as an early stage of sex chromosome evolution. Our results and previous karyotyping studies demonstrated that bighead carp has evolved a sex-determining region, but has not yet formed distinguishable (heteromorphic) sex chromosomes.56To study whether Cyprinidae fish shared the same sex-determination system, we blasted the 8,661 bp sequences to the male-specific region in grass carp (Ctenopharyngodon idellus) genome,39 and found that most of the 4,148 bp of male-specific sequences in grass carp were presented in bighead carp male-specific regions with ~94% identify. Furthermore, one male-specific marker has been found in common carp (Cyprinus carpio) from the Yellow River,57 but we found that sequence presented in gynogenetic Songpu common carp genome. This demonstrates that this sequence might be a strain-specific sex marker in common carp. And we found no similarity between it and male-specific marker in bighead carp. Unlike the big carp, the sex-determination of zebrafish has been found to be both genetic and environmental.33 Several markers have been found in the zebrafish genome. Chromosome 4 are closely-related to its sex,58 but we found the male-specific region in bighead carp cannot mapped to that region in zebrafish genome. The reason for above phenomena might be the ancestor of zebrafish divided with the ancestor of Endemic Clad of East Asia Cyprinidae (ECEAC) fish at about 30 Mya, which is much older than specification of fish within ECEAC (about 5~9 Mya).59 Based on this information, the bighead carp male-specific sequence was not only shared in silver carp but also in grass carp, and we predict that this male-specific sequence might emerge in the ancestor of ECEAC fish and was kept in all extent diploid fish in this group. As to the common carp, which is a tetraploid fish, it might have formed its own sex-determination region or genes in its speciation process.60Sex-specific markers have been successfully used to identify the sex determination systems in many species,18,24,35–38 and it is especially valuable in species that lack heteromorphic sex chromosomes.37 In this study, the presence of male-specific markers indicates an XX/XY sex determination system in bighead carp and silver carp. A larger sample size of bighead carp was used to further verify the accuracy of the male-specific markers, and the verification efficiency was 100% in all mature individuals. Besides, the female-to-male segregation ratio in three full-sib families was 1 : 1. All those results strongly indicated that bighead carp and silver carp have a genetic XX/XY sex determination system, which is similar to the grass carp’s XX/XY sex determination system.39 Based on these results and the phylogenetic position of fishes discussed earlier, we predicted that the ancestor of the whole Cyprinidae might have a XX/XY sex determination system. And this system might persist in all extent species in Cyprinidae and facilitate the hybrid between different species within this group.Bighead carp and silver carp are two of the most closely related species of the Cyprinidae family, cytogenetic analyses revealed that they have similar karyotypes and lack visually heteromorphic sex chromosomes.56,61 The linkage groups of bighead carp and silver carp showed a 1 : 1 best orthologues relationship based on comparative genome mapping,62 meaning a low level of genetic diversity. In this study, bighead carp, silver carp and grass carp shared the same sex-specific markers and sex-determining DNA sequence, suggesting that they may have a homologous nascent Y chromosome and the same pathways involved in sex determination systems. Therefore, the three carp should share the most recent common ancestor and the sex determination systems probably arose before speciation.We presented an approach that identifies and validates sex-specific markers using 2b-RAD sequencing and genome re-sequencing from multiple male and female individuals in bighead carp and silver carp. A male-specific scaffold was identified and three sex-specific primers were designed first according the male-specific scaffold. The sex-specific markers could be used in genetic sexing with 100% accuracy in brood fish and a large number of young fish from full-sib families. In addition, all gynogenetic progenies were genetically sexed as female by these sex-specific markers, confirming the female homogamety sex determination system in bighead carp. Taken together, all these results confirm that bighead carp and silver carp have a genetic mechanism of sex determination with an XX/XY sex determination system. The sex-specific markers developed in this study would be powerful and effective tools to uncover the sex determination system and identify potential genomic regions in bighead carp and silver carp.This study was supported by grants from the NSFC (31472268 and 31502153), FEBL (2016FBZ05) and DAC (2009045).

Thus, our work constructs a hepatic cell-specific splicing landscape and reveals the considerable contribution of AS to the cell type constitution and organ features.1. IntroductionAlternative splicing (AS) plays a major role in increasing transcriptome variability and proteome diversity.1,2 It is estimated that 95% of multi-exon genes in human undergo AS,3 and the resulting isoforms from one gene could present identical, similar or even opposite protein functions.4,5 AS variants are variably expressed between different tissues and cell types, and most of the recent studies focused on the varying effects of AS in different species or tissue types.4,6,7 AS is highly prevalent across distinct species, and the divergences in AS patterns significantly contribute to shaping species-specific differences.8–10 Furthermore, it was suggested that proteins with tissue-specific isoforms were likely to occupy key hubs in protein interaction networks.4,6,7,11 Although the roles of AS in tissue specificity have been well-studied, splicing differences at the cellular level and in multiple cell types from one single organ were almost neglected to date.Thus, we expected to establish splicing profiling of four cell types from the mouse liver as a paradigm of exploring cell-type-specific splicing patterns. The liver is the largest metabolic organ of the mammals and participates in multiple biological functions, the majority of which are performed by parenchymal cells, also named hepatocytes (HCs), occupying approximately 80% of the liver volume.12 The remainders are nonparenchymal cells (NPCs), including the liver sinusoidal endothelial cells (LSECs), the Kupffer cells (KCs), the hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and several rare cell types.12 Despite the small fraction in total liver volume, NPCs also perform significant functions.13–15Recently, although some cell-type-specific proteomic analyses had performed in mouse liver16,17 that globally investigated the proteome profiles of individual cell types and possible mechanisms of intercellular crosstalk, we still want to know how this proteomic complexity was generated and how AS contributed in such processes. Given that tissue-specific exons play crucial roles in determining tissue identity, we wondered whether this feature also expands to the cellular level in the liver and how AS regulates the biological functions of isoforms in different cell types. Thus, in our study, we obtained highly purified liver cells and applied RNA-Seq to build the first dataset of cell-type-specific transcriptomic profiling. Next, we comprehensively compared the splicing patterns between the four hepatic cell types and analyzed their biological characteristics. Furthermore, we identified the cell-type-specific splicing factors that dominated the splicing patterns and functional characteristics in respective cell types. Last, we took HCs-specific Tak1 isoform as an example to demonstrate the effect of splicing switching on cell-type specificities. Overall, our results revealed a hepatic cell-type-specific splicing profile that played a considerable role in determining cellular-specific functions.2. Materials and methods2.1. Isolation of four hepatic cell typesC57BL/6 male mice (8–10 weeks old) were killed, and their livers were excised by operation according to the ethics committee guidelines of the Beijing Institute of Radiation Medicine. To reduce the biological variation among individuals, the liver samples from three mice were pooled for the sequencing of each cell type. All procedures were reported before.172.2. RNA-seq data generation and processingTotal RNA of four hepatic cell types was isolated with Trizol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. RNA quality was assessed using Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. RNA-seq library was prepared using Illumina’s reagent and protocol. Paried-end 90 bp sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 genome analyzer. Clean reads were mapped to the mouse GENCODE M4 (GRCm38) using Tophat2 (version 2.0.10)18 with a mate inner size of 20. FPKM were then calculated as relative abundance value for each gene and transcript by Cufflinks (version 2.2.1)19 supplied with a protein-coding gene model annotation file in GTF format (GENCODE M4).2.3. Differential analysis of AS between four cell typesMATS20 was applied to identify the differential alternative splicing between four cell types with options ‘-t paired –len 90 –a 8 –c 0.0001 –expressionChange 20’. Significant different events were filtered under the threshold of FDR < 0.05 for five common splicing classes. Percent spliced-in (PSI) values for each alternative exon were extracted from MATS outputs.2.4. Feature analysis of CEEsCell-type-enriched exons (CEEs) required statistically significant differences (<U+0394>PSI > 0.25 and FDR < 0.05) between at least two cell types. All exons were mapped to annotated proteins (Ensembl release 78) using the method of Ensembl Perl API. Protein domains of Pfam21 were extracted from Ensembl annotations for mapped exons. IUPred22 was applied to predict protein disorder information. The fraction of segments classified as disordered by the IUPred cutoff of 0.4. ANCHOR23 was used for predicting protein binding regions. PTM sites were collected from the UniProt database after mapping the Ensembl protein ID to UniProt accessions. The statistically significant differences were assessed by <U+03C7>2 test.2.5. Splicing validation by RT-PCRTotal RNA was reverse transcribed using the PrimeScriptTM RT Master Mix (TaKaRa Bio Technology), and PCR was performed using Premix TaqTM (TaKaRa TaqTM Version 2.0 plus dye, TaKaRa BioTechnology). The PCR products were separated by electrophoresis in 2% agarose gels and detected using the Gel Doc EZ System (Bio-Rad, USA). Sequencing of the PCR products was performed by BGI.tech (Beijing, China). All the primers were listed in Supplementary File S1.2.6. GO and pathway enrichment analysisAll enrichment analysis was performed by the DAVID online tool (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/).24 Enriched functional terms mainly included three ontology terms (BP_FAT, CC_FAT and MF_FAT) and the KEGG pathway. Significantly enriched terms were determined under FDR < 0.05. The GO and pathway networks for splicing factor-regulated target genes were built using Enrichment Map25 in Cytoscape 3.2.026 with the parameters of P < 0.001 and FDR < 0.1.2.7. Oligonucleotide synthesisThe splice switching oligonucleotides (SSOs) were synthesised by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. The sequences were listed in Supplementary File S1.2.8. Cell cultureThe AML12 (alpha mouse liver 12) cell line was purchased from ATCC (CRL-2254), which was established from HCs from a mouse (CD1 strain, line MT42) transgenic for human TGFa. These cells exhibit typical HC features, being a suitable alternative option for the mouse primary HCs. The cells were cultured in DMEM (GIBCO, USA) with 10% of fetal bovine serum (GIBCO, USA) and supplied with 1% of insulin-transferrin-selenium (GIBCO, USA) and 40 ng/ml dexamethasone (Sigma, USA).2.9. The knockdown of the splicing factorsThe siRNAs used for the knockdown of the indicated splicing factors were designed and synthesised by Sangon Biotech (Shanghai) Co., Ltd. After 72-hs transfection, the total RNA of AML12 cells was extracted and the AS of Tak1 gene was analyzed. The siRNA sequences were listed in Supplementary File S1.2.10. Enrichment analysis of RNA-binding sitesRNA-binding sites of splicing factors were mapped to pre-mRNA using the RBPmap online tool (http://rbpmap.technion.ac.il/)27 with the parameters of a high stringency level and conservation filter. The input sequences included alternative exon regions and their neighboring intron regions (300 bp). Enrichment of RNA-binding sites was performed using the hypergeometric test, and FDR < 0.05 was used to assess significance.2.11. Data presentationUnsupervised hierarchical clustering was performed by Perseus software with default options (distance = ‘Euclidean’). Cumulative distribution curves were visualized using the ggplot2 package in R. Other statistical tests were also performed by R software.3. Data availabilityThe RNA-Seq data from this study have been deposited into the NCBI Short Read Archive database under study accession number SRP033468.4. Results4.1. A global view of gene expression and splicing patternsIn total, we identified 12,947 genes with FPKM = 1 (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S1), each cell type had a series of cell-specific genes, while the majority (65.6%) were detected in all. The detected gene number of HCs, LSECs, KCs and HSCs was 9,967, 10,573, 10,964 and 11,767, respectively. The parenchymal cells, which participate in the liver’s main biological functions, had the least number of total genes but more high-abundance (FPKM = 100) genes than NPCs (Fig. 1A). RT-qPCR of 20 randomly selected genes was performed in additional biological samples, the expression patterns of which were similar to the patterns obtained from the RNA-Seq, indicating the high correlation and good reproducibility between multiple samples (Supplementary Fig. S1A).

(D) The correlation analysis of PSI values calculated from RNA-Seq and RT-PCR.The genome-wide extent of AS was analyzed by searching against known splicing junctions. We focused on five common types of AS (Supplementary Fig. S1B). The AS events identified in our data achieved an average coverage of 81.5% of all known events in the Ensembl database (Supplementary Fig. S1C), consistent with the fact of that the liver was frequently regulated by AS (Supplementary Fig. S1D and Table S2). Most of the AS events existed in all four cell types (Fig. 1B), and in our data, 46.2% of multi-exon genes underwent AS, half of which had three or more AS variants, indicating the distinguishing contribution of AS to the proteome diversity in mouse liver cells (Fig. 1C). Consistent with previous studies in mammals,3 the skipped exon (SE) was the main AS type in mouse liver, followed by A3SS (Alternative 3' splice site) and A5SS (Alternative 5' splice site), and a low frequency was observed for retained intron and mutually exclusive exons (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S1C). All types tended to occur equally in different cell types, with a rank from 69.8% to 72.5% for SE (Fig. 1B). Although LSECs didn’t have the largest gene number, it had more AS events than the other three cell types, which indicated a precise regulation on the splicing level beyond the transcriptional regulation in LSECs.To confirm the identification of AS from RNA-Seq data, randomly selected AS events were validated by RT-PCR (Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. S1E), and the results displayed a high Pearson correlation (R2 = 0.808) of PSI values from RT-PCR and RNA-Seq.4.2. Association of gene functions with ASWe classified the AS-regulated genes detected in all cell types into several function categories using MetaCore software. In general, the genes that most frequently regulated by AS were those encoding ‘regulators (GDI, GAP and GEF)’ (62.2%), ‘transcription factor’ (56.7%) and ‘generic kinase’ (56.2%). While for ‘receptor ligand’, ‘GPCR’ and ‘ligand-gated ion channel’, only 33.2, 29.7 and 24.1% of genes were regulated by AS (Fig. 2A), indicating a putative mechanism that the distinct regulation of AS on genes of different function categories. Besides, AS did not happen equally across different cell types even for the genes in the same function categories. We found that the genes of ligand-gated ion channels did not undergo AS equally across cell types, the genes were more often regulated by AS in LSECs (45.8%) than in HCs (16.7%) (Fig. 2A). The statistical significance of spliced genes proportion for each function category between different cell types was shown in Supplementary Fig. S2A. In the liver, several diseases were caused by ion channel dysfunction.28 Different ion channels might have specialized biological significances in one particular cell type, yet no relevant investigation has been reported so far. Functional categories of spliced genes across cell types.

Enrichment analysis shows the corresponding functional annotation for spliced gene clusters.We next analyzed the enriched functional terms of AS-regulated genes in distinct cell contexts. The AS-regulated genes in HCs were highly enriched in multiple metabolic processes, such as the organic substance metabolic process and the primary metabolic process. Similarly, in NPCs, the AS-regulated genes also tended to play roles in cell-type-specific functions, just as cytoskeleton organization and immune system process (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S2B). To our surprise, plenty of AS-regulated genes functioning in regulating biological processes, such as ‘positive regulation of metabolic process’, were significantly enriched in NPCs instead of in HCs (Fig. 2B). To eliminate the potential effects of low abundance genes on enrichment analysis, we separately chose the 1000 and 2000 most abundant AS genes in each cell type to reanalyze the enriched biological processes and obtained the consistent trend (Supplementary Fig. S2C and D). Besides, all the four cell types showed an almost uniform cumulative distribution and the bulk of transcription was dominated by a few high abundance genes (Supplementary Fig. S3A), demonstrating they would be identically affected by detection sensitivity for low abundance genes. These findings confirmed the important roles involving regulation of metabolic process in NPCs and provided new evidence of the cooperation between HCs and NPCs on the isoform level.Furthermore, we explored the association of AS with gene functions using the quantitative data of splicing in different cell types. We firstly defined the CEEs as described in the Materials and Methods section. The unsupervised hierarchical clustering revealed that these exons exhibited obvious splicing switches between different cell types (Fig. 2C). Functionally, the genes with HC-enriched exons were linked to ‘regulation of kinase cascade’ and ‘phosphoprotein’, largely reflecting the identities of the HCs and differing them from NPC-enriched exons. In NPCs, each cluster also revealed significant enrichment in specific GO terms, including ‘cell surface receptor linked signal transduction’ (LSEC-enriched), ‘regulation of immune effector process’ (KC-enriched) and ‘membrane organization’ (HSC-enriched). These CEE-contained genes reflected the core functions of respective cell types, as the visualized global diversity of all genes with FPKM = 1 and the functional enrichment analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3B and C).4.3. Functional properties of CEEsTissue-enriched exons had exhibited multiple properties that distinguished them from constitutive exons.6,7 Thus, we wondered if the CEEs in mouse liver also had similar properties and how AS affecting protein functions. In our data, although some of the CEEs destroyed the functional protein domain (e.g. the immunoglobulin domain 1 of Fgfr1) when excluded from the pre-mRNA, the CEEs had a significantly smaller fraction of overlapping to protein domains compared with other alternative exons and constitutive exons (Fig. 3A;P<2.07E-15). In contrast, an increased fraction overlapping to predicted disordered regions was observed (Fig. 3B;P<4.56E-11). The disordered regions had important regulatory effects on protein–protein interaction (PPI) networks,6,7 and consistently, the CEEs were significantly enriched in regions that involved in PPI regulation (Fig. 3C;P<7.16E-04). In addition, these CEEs contained more post-translational modification (PTM) sites than others (Fig. 3D, adjusted to the length of the exons; P<0.022). Together, in mouse liver, our results suggested that the CEEs might regulate isoform functions through affecting PPIs and modifying PTM process, consistent with the previous reports on the tissue-specific exons.6,7Characterization of CEEs.

(F) Variants-switching validation between HCs and NPCs for Tak1, Sidt2, Lrch3 and Mbnl1.A scatter diagram illustrated all the alternative exons that exhibited markedly different PSIs between HCs and NPCs (Fig. 3E). The circles shown in Fig. 3E highlighted the flexibility of the splicing regulatory machinery, with a large number of exons predominantly included in one cell type but excluded in others (just like exon 12 of Tak1, with a PSI of 0.886 in HCs, but 0.051, 0.059 and 0.117 in LSECs, KCs and HSCs, respectively; Supplementary File S3). We used RT-PCR assays to validate individual AS events detected by RNA-Seq (Fig. 3F). The validated examples included (but not limited to) the genes that functioning in regulating the MAPK pathway (Tak1), splicing regulation (Mbnl1), glucose homeostasis (Sidt2) and a gene with putative immune functions (Lrch3). Most of the exons correlated well with our RNA-Seq data, exhibiting a strong cell-type-regulated AS pattern.4.4. Regulation of as by splicing factorsWe were interested in how these CEEs generated and which particular splicing factor (SF) might dominate the splicing patterns. First, we collected 94 splicing factors from RBPmap,27 78 of which (with 114 experimentally confirmed binding motifs) were expressed in our data with FPKM = 1 and displayed variable cell-type specificities (Fig. 4A). The most significant diversity was observed between HCs and NPCs, and each cell type had a set of highly expressed splicing factors, as listed in Supplementary File S4. Identification of cell-type-specific splicing factors. (A) Differential expression patterns of splicing factors revealed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering. (B) Differential expression abundances of four cell-type-specific splicing factors in both mRNA and protein level.Identification of cell-type-specific splicing factors. (A) Differential expression patterns of splicing factors revealed by unsupervised hierarchical clustering. (B) Differential expression abundances of four cell-type-specific splicing factors in both mRNA and protein level.In both mRNA and protein levels, we identified the high-expressed splicing factors in each cell type, such as Esrp2 in HCs, Rbfox2 in LSECs, Srsf9 in KCs and Rbms3 in HSCs (Fig. 4B, proteomics data came from the literature 17). We used RBPmap to search the target genes of these splicing factors, followed by the functional enrichment analysis. These splicing factors controlled a large proportion of the cell-type-specific AS events, and the target genes were highly enriched in cell specialized functions. For example, Esrp2 was highly expressed in HCs but not in three other NPCs, and the targets of Esrp2 were significantly enriched in terms of liver specialized functions, such as lipoprotein and coenzyme metabolism (Fig. 5A). The target genes of the LSEC-specific splicing factor Rbfox2 were enriched in cytoskeleton organization and cell adhesion (Fig. 5B). Rbfox2 was reported to splice the Tak1 pre-mRNA to the short variant Tak1-A instead of the full-length Tak1-B, consistent with the distribution of Tak1 variants in HCs and LSECs.29 Similarly, in Kupffer Cells, we found that the target genes of Srsf9 were highly enriched in multiple immunity-related biological processes and pathways (Fig. 5C and Supplementary Fig. S4A). Furthermore, although little was reported about the functions of Rbms3 in the liver, our data showed that Rbms3 were exclusively high-expressed in HSCs, regulating a range of biological processes, especially those HSC-specific functions like cell-matrix adhesion (Fig. 5D).

Enriched biological processes of spliced genes regulated by (A) Esrp2 in HCs, (B) Rbfox2 in LSECs, (C) Srsf9 in KCs and (D) Rbms3 in HSCs.Besides analyzing the differential expressed splicing factors, we combined the trans-acting splicing factors and cis-element (binding motifs) surrounding CEEs and built a splicing regulatory map, in order to further identify the important splicing factors in each cell type (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Specifically, LSECs exhibited the most significant enrichment of RNA-binding motifs of splicing factors across all cell types, consistent with the largest AS event number in LSECs (Supplementary Fig. S4B and 1B), suggesting the functional diversity of LSECs and potential interplay with other cell types in various aspects.30–324.5. Specific Tak1 isoform regulates hepatic cell-type-specific functionsGrowing evidence suggested that protein isoforms generated from AS can perform distinct or even opposite functions.33,34 We attempted to reveal the functions of cell-specific isoforms of Tak1 in distinct cell types. Tak1 has four main variants generated by AS (Supplementary Fig. S5A), depending on the spliced-in or -out of exon 12 and exon 16.29 We provided a detailed splicing map of exon 12 of Tak1 (TGF-activated kinase 1) gene. Rbfox2, which highly expressed in LSECs, was reported to splice the Tak1 pre-mRNA to the short variant Tak1-A, consistent with the distribution of Tak1 variants in HCs and LSECs. Besides, we used RBPmap to predict the splicing factors that considered to be involved in the formation of Tak1’s splicing pattern, and several candidates with distinct expression patterns were selected, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S5B. We considered that splicing factors with different expression patterns were more likely to contribute in the formation of the cell-type-specific splicing patterns, while in the exonic regions, the predicted splicing factors did not exhibit significant expression differences between HCs and NPCs, thus, the intronic area might be more important in the AS regulation of Tak1. Several splicing factors were proved to be involved in this regulation, but single splicing factor did not play a decisive role (Supplementary Fig. S5C), which indicated that the specific splicing pattern of Tak1 resulted from the possible cooperation and competition of multiple splicing regulators in mouse liver cells.35We collected 561 public RNA-Seq datasets from the Sequence Read Archive database with RPBmap tools to obtain a comprehensive expression profile of Tak1 variants.36,Tak1-B was highly expressed in tissues with strong proliferation and metabolism properties, whereas Tak1-A was usually existed in tissues with immune functions, such as the spleen and several immune cells (Supplementary Fig. S5D). Coordinately, a multiple instance learning based analysis36 revealed that Tak1-B was more concentrated in some basic metabolic processes, while Tak1-A was primarily responsible for immune functions (Fig. 6A), consistent with the distribution of Tak1 variants in HCs and NPCs.

(F) Several lipids and cholesterol synthesis related genes were up-regulated after the conversion. Significance was calculated using the t-test. *P<0.05.We downloaded the PDB files of the two isoforms to predict the protein structure differences between Tak1-A and Tak1-B by searching Protein Data Bank (PDB) archive. Although the serine-threonine/tyrosine protein kinase catalytic domain of the two isoforms were unaffected by AS (from Pfam database), they had differences in spatial structures around the peptides that translated from exon 11 to exon 13 (Fig. 6B). The peptide segment altered by the spliced exon 12 fell in the protein-binding region (marked in Fig. 6B), suggesting that gain or loss of Tak1 isoform function might be caused by the affected interaction protein partner.We then used SSOs to explore the exact functional differences between Tak1 isoforms. We converted Tak1-B to Tak1-A in AML12 cells, in which Tak1-B was the main variant, just like in the HCs (Fig. 6C). As we analyzed previously, the CEEs could change the PPIs by affecting the protein binding domains, here, Co-IP showed that Tak1-A bound to Tab2 (but not to Tab1) more easily than Tak1-B did (Fig. 6D). It was reported that the binding to Tab1 and Tab2 was necessary for the activation of Tak1 and the downstream pathways. Our results showed that as the conversion of Tak1-B to Tak1-A, the downstream JNK, p38 and NF-<U+03BA>B pathways were significantly activated (Fig. 6E). Activated JNK and p38 pathways had important roles in cellular inflammatory response,37 which consistent with the distribution and the functionality of Tak1-A in NPCs.We also found that the conversion of Tak1-B to Tak1-A triggered a significant up-regulation of genes related with lipids and cholesterol synthesis in AML12 cells, whereas lipolysis-related genes (Lipc) were down-regulated (Fig. 6F). These results were also consistent with the potential metabolic regulation function of Tak1-B in HCs (Fig. 6A). In addition, Lkb1, the gene associated with maintenance of cell polarity in HCs, was significantly down-regulated (Fig. 6F), suggesting that Tak1-B also played important roles in maintaining cell polarity (Fig. 6A).Thus, for the Tak1 gene, isoforms distributed in a cell-type-specific manner adequately fulfilled its functional plasticity. The full-length Tak1-B was the dominant isoform in HCs, regulating the cell-type specific functions such as lipid metabolism. While in NPCs, Rbfox2, as well as some other splicing factors, made Tak1-A the main isoform. Tak1-A bound to Tab2 more easily than Tak1-B did, activated the downstream JNK and p38 pathways. Thus, Tak1-A exhibited the immune process regulation properties in NPCs. These observations indicated that the regulation of CEEs by AS was closely associated with the cell-type-specific functions and had important roles in the formation of liver cell-type specificities.5. DiscussionAlthough the cell-type-specific proteomic research in the mouse liver provided a better understanding of the identities of the individual cell type and how these cell types worked together,16 we still wanted to know how this complexity of proteomics was generated and how AS variants distributed and functioned across different cell types. In this article, we identified 13,637 AS events from all four cell types, with an average coverage of 81.5% of all known events. We revealed the first profile of cell-type-specific AS events defined in mouse liver, and this profile was associated with a broad range of functional processes of the liver.AS variants had differential distribution patterns across various cell types. In HCs, the AS-regulated genes were highly enriched in functions that include ‘regulation of kinase cascade’, ‘phosphoprotein’ and ‘metabolism’, whereas the genes involved in ’regulation of immune effector process’ in KCs were most frequently regulated by AS. This finding indicated that the genes with distinct cell-type-specific splicing manners were relevant to the core biological functions of respective cell types.Increasing studies reported that some AS events had crucial impacts on multiple biological processes and developmental stages, especially in the nervous system.33,38 In our research, the genes coding the kinase and transcription factors were more likely to be regulated by AS, which might be the important mechanism that AS caused wide impacts on multiple biological processes. More widely, the CEEs were significantly enriched in regions that involved in PPI regulation, which might also be the approach that AS affecting isoform functions.AS is regulated by complicated interplays of cis-elements and trans-acting factors (splicing factors). The splicing factors recognize the ‘binding motifs’ to promote or suppress the splicing of the exon.39 According to Professor Phillip A. Sharp, some splicing factors are required for dominating the specialized splicing patterns and have critical roles in maintaining cellular homeostasis, namely the ‘master splicing factors’.40 Here, we found several relatively high-expressed splicing factors in each cell type, like Esrp2 in HCs and Rbfox2 in LSECs. These splicing factors dominated the formation of the cell-type-specific splicing patterns (like the splicing pattern of Tak1 in HCs and NPCs), demonstrating that the terminal of an alternative exon was depended on the splicing factors, cell types and the motif locations, revealing a precise regulation on the pre-mRNA level in specific cellular contexts. Besides, the functional analysis also showed that they regulated the specialized biological functions in respective cell types, which made them strong candidates for the ‘master splicing factors’ in mouse liver cells.We were most interested in how a single AS event functioned diversely in distinct cell types. The conversion of Tak1-B to Tak1-A activated the downstream JNK and p38 pathways because of the enhanced Tak1-Tab2 interaction. The activated signal pathways had important roles in cellular inflammatory response, consistent with the distribution and the functionality of Tak1-A variant in NPCs. Besides, the conversion triggered a significant up-regulation of genes related to lipids and cholesterol synthesis, whereas lipolysis-related genes were down-regulated, coordinating with the functional predictions of Tak1-B. This example showed how AS regulated the isoform functions to shape the liver cell-type specificities.In summary, our research provided the first profile of cell-type-specific transcriptome and splicing patterns in mouse liver and confirmed that the cell identities were largely defined by cell-type-specific AS events. These events altered isoform functions through remodeling PPI networks and modifying PTM sites and were controlled by a series of splicing factors. Analysis of cell-type-specific splicing enabled us to better demonstrating the functional landscape of hepatic cell types. Spliced genes played diverse roles in the corresponding cell types by differential exon usage even if they exhibited similar expression profiling at the gene level. This information improved our knowledge of additional regulation and appropriate composition of hepatic cell types.This work was partially supported by National Key R&D Program of China (nos. 2016YFC0902400 and 2017YFC0906603), Chinese State Key Projects for Basic Research (‘973 Program’) (nos. 2014CBA02001 and 2013CB910502), National Natural Science Foundation of China (nos. 81770581, 81570526 and 81123001), Innovation project (16CXZ027), the Program of International S&T Cooperation (2014DFB30020 and 2014DFB30010), Natural Science Foundation of Beijing (7152036), Beijing Science and Technology Project (Z161100002616036), Open Project Program of the State Key Laboratory of Proteomics (Academy of Military Medical Sciences, SKLP-O201509) and China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (2015M582850).Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.Supplementary data"

IntroductionMaculavirus is a plant virus typified by Grapevine fleck virus (GFkV).1 The genome of GFkV is a 7,564-base-long single-stranded RNA containing four putative open reading frames each of which encodes replicase (RdRp), coat protein (CP) and one or two proline-rich proteins with unknown functions. The RdRp and CP are phylogenetically related to the corresponding proteins found in members of the genera Tymovirus and Marafivirus. The host range of maculaviruses is restricted to European and American Vitis species, but their vectors have not been identified.In 2005, we identified a 2,379-base-long cDNA clone from the cDNA library of the silkworm Bombyx mori ovary-derived BmN-4 cell line, which had significant homology to the rdrp and cp genes of GFkV.2 Northern blot analysis showed that two transcripts of 6.5 and 1.3 kb are expressed in BmN-4 cells and the shorter transcript is likely a subgenomic fragment containing the cp gene. Cloning and sequencing of the full-length 6,519-base-long cDNA revealed that this RNA contains three putative genes: rdrp, cp and p15. The putative p15 protein does not show significant homology with any known proteins, although the RdRp and CP exhibited high homology to those of GFkV. Virus-like particles containing this maculavirus-like RNA were purified from BmN-4 cells and isometric virions 28 to 30 nm in diameter were observed under electron microscopy. We termed this novel RNA virus Bombyx mori macula-like virus (BmMLV). BmMLV is currently characterized as an unclassified maculavirus.3BmMLV was detected in seven out of eight cell lines derived from B. mori, but not from two other lepidopteran cell lines Spodoptera frugiperda Sf-9 and Trichoplusia ni High Five.2 Infection studies revealed that persistent infections with BmMLV are not established in Sf-9 cells.4 The level of BmMLV cp RNA in BmN-4 cells is comparable to that of a housekeeping gene Actin3 in BmN-4 cells,2 indicating that BmMLV accumulated at extremely high levels in persistently infected silkworm cells. Recently, we found B. mori embryo-derived VF cells that have not been infected with BmMLV.5 We successfully established VF cells persistently infected with BmMLV (designated as VF-MLV) without strong cytopathic effects, suggesting that BmMLV has a potential to establish persistent infections in silkworm cells. At present, however, it is unknown how this ‘insect’ maculavirus replicates and establishes persistent infections only in silkworm cells.In this study, we performed transcriptome analysis of silkworm cells acutely or persistently infected with BmMLV and found that BmMLV p15 is highly expressed in BmMLV-infected cells. Further experiments using infectious cDNA clones showed that p15 is essential for establishing BmMLV infections in silkworm cells. In addition, we observed a gradual decrease in BmMLV RNA during the establishment of persistent infections. Small RNA sequencing and knockdown experiments revealed that BmMLV RNA-derived small interfering RNAs (vsiRNAs) and PIWI-interacting RNAs (vpiRNAs) play essential roles in establishing persistent infections in silkworm cells.2. Materials and methods2.1. Cell linesBmN-4 cells (provided by Chisa Yasunaga-Aoki, Kyushu University, and maintained in our laboratory)6 were cultured at 27°C in IPL-41 medium (Applichem) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum. VF and VF-MLV cells (established and maintained in our laboratory) were cultured at 27°C in IPL-41 medium (Applichem) supplemented with gamma ray-treated 10% fetal bovine serum.52.2. Transfection and Western blottingTransfection of VF cells with BmMLV infectious clones and Western blotting with anti-CP and Actin antibodies were performed as described previously.5 cDNA clones pHMLV-<U+0394>p15 and pHMLV-p15<U+0394>Met + Stop were generated with a KOD -plus- Mutagenesis Kit (TOYOBO) using pHMLV5 as a template.2.3. RNA-seqRNA-seq experiments were performed as described previously.7 RNA-seq libraries were generated from total RNA samples prepared from BmMLV-infected VF cells at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 h post-infection (hpi) and 2 weeks post-infection (wpi), and from VF-MLV cells using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina). The libraries were analysed by the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform based on 100-bp paired-end reads according to the manufacturer’s protocol. De novo assembly of RNA-seq data from eight data sets was performed using Trinity.8 The transcript abundance in each contig was quantified by RSEM.9 Differentially expressed genes (DEGs, P < 0.005) between 0 hpi and other samples were identified by DESeq.10 We selected 150 DEGs with more than 30 transcripts per million in any data set. Raw RNA-seq data were also mapped to the BmMLV genome by TopHat2.11 Clustering analysis was performed as described previously.122.4. Sequence analysis of cloned small RNAsCloning and sequencing of Siwi- and BmAgo3-bound BmN-4 piRNAs were performed as described previously.13 VF cells were infected with BmMLV5 and small RNA libraries were constructed using a Small RNA Cloning Kit (TaKaRa) and sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform. Informatics analysis of small RNAs was performed as reported previously.14 In brief, The 3'-adaptor sequences were identified and removed, allowing for up to two mismatches. Reads shorter than 20 nucleotides (nt) or longer than 32 nt were excluded, thereby obtaining reads of 20–32 nt. Mapping small RNAs to the Bombyx genome15 was performed using bowtie.16 Reads that could be aligned to the genome up to two mismatches were used to calculate the mapping rate of each library. Mapping rates against the genome were used for normalization. Sam files were converted to bam files by SAMtools,17 then to bed files, and the coverage of each nucleotides was calculated by BEDTools.182.5. RNA interference (RNAi) in BmN-4, VF and VF-MLV cellsRNAi experiments in BmN-4 cells were performed as described previously.19 VF and VF-MLV cells (2.5 × 105 cells per 35-mm diameter dish) were transfected with siRNAs (250 pmol per dish) using X-tremeGENE HP (Roche). Transfection was performed twice at 72 h intervals. VF cells were infected with BmMLV during the second transfection. Total RNA was isolated at 96 h after the second transfection.2.6. Reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR)To validate the RNA-seq analysis (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2A), total RNA was reverse transcribed by PrimeScript™ RT reagent Kit (TaKaRa) and RT-qPCR was performed with SYBR Premix ExTaq II (Tli RNaseH Plus). For the RT-qPCR experiments shown in Figs 4A–C, 5A–B, Supplementary Figs S5A–B, S5D, S6A–B and S7A, the total RNA was subjected to reverse transcription with avian myeloblastosis virus reverse transcriptase and oligo-dT primer (TaKaRa). RT-qPCR was performed using a KAPA SYBR FAST qPCR Kit (Kapa Biosystems) and the specific primers listed in Supplementary Table S2. The expression values were calculated using the 2-Ct method. The value of each transcript in control cells was considered to be 100 and the relative levels of transcripts in treated cells were estimated.2.7. Agrobacterium coinfiltration leaf patch assayBmMLV p15 cDNA was amplified using primers p15_supp_F and p15_supp_R from the BmMLV full-length cDNA clone pHMLV, and cloned into the pE7133 vector (pE7133-P15).20 The plasmid pE7133-HC-Pro was also generated by inserting the helper component-protease (HC-Pro) gene of Zucchini yellow mosaic virus (ZYMV) Z5 isolate.21 Subsequently, the fragments between E7 (35S promoter upstream sequence of the cauliflower mosaic virus) and Tnos (polyadenylation signal of the gene for nopaline synthase) of pE7133-P15, pE7133-HC-Pro and pE7133-GUS20 were subcloned into the Agrobacterium binary vector pCAMBIA230022 (designated 35S-P15, 35S-HC-Pro and 35S-GUS, respectively). Each of the constructs was transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain GV2260. Agrobacterium cultures harboring 35S-GFP and 35S-P15, 35S-HC-Pro or 35S-GUS were mixed in equal proportions and coinfiltrated into the Nicotiana benthamiana 16c leaves.23 After 5 days of postinfiltration, GFP fluorescence was observed and photographed using a fluorescence microscope (M205 FA, Leica) with a cooled CCD camera (DFC450 C, Leica).2.8. Accession numbersThe deep sequencing data obtained in this study are available under the accession numbers DRA003575 (RNA-seq), DRA005085–DRA005087 (piRNA-seq).3. Results and discussionBmMLV belongs to the plant virus genus Maculavirus, but this virus propagates to a massive extent in silkworm cells and establishes persistent infections without strong cytopathic effects.2,5 To understand the molecular interaction between this plant virus-like virus and insect cells, we performed RNA-seq experiments using BmMLV and B. mori embryo-derived BmMLV-free VF cells.5 We used total RNA samples prepared from BmMLV-infected VF cells at 0, 6, 12, 24, 48 and 96 hpi and at 2 wpi. We also performed RNA-seq analysis using VF cells that had been persistently infected with BmMLV for more than 2 years (VF-MLV).5 We selected 150 DEGs (P < 0.005) between 0 hpi and other samples by DESeq and classified them into 10 clusters based on their expression patterns (Fig. 1A and B and Supplementary Table S1). The expression patterns of some DEGs were verified in RT-qPCR experiments (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2A). Clusters A–F included DEGs with expression levels that transiently increased following BmMLV infection, but remained at basal levels in VF-MLV cells. The expression levels of the DEGs in clusters A, C and D were higher at 2 wpi than at 0 hpi, whereas the DEGs in clusters B and F declined rapidly at 24 hpi and 2 wpi, respectively and then remained at the basal level. Cluster G was the largest cluster and contained 37 genes encoding transcription factors, enzymes and heat shock proteins. The expression of cluster G genes gradually decreased until 96 hpi and they returned to the basal levels in VF-MLV cells. The DEGs in clusters H and I were up-regulated during transient infection and they remained at high levels in VF-MLV cells. Cluster J contained 21 DEGs with markedly higher expression in persistently infected VF-MLV cells than in acutely infected cells. Two genes, Dscam and fasciclin, which have been shown to function in cell adhesion,24,25 were included in this cluster. RT-qPCR verified the gradual increases in the Dscam and fasciclin mRNA levels and their high expression levels in VF cells at 2 wpi as well as in VF-MLV cells (Supplementary Fig. S2A). Up-regulation of these cell adhesion molecules might lead to the formation of cell aggregates, which were observed frequently during BmMLV infection (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Transcriptome analysis showed that the changes in the mRNA levels of most genes were transient, i.e. the mRNA levels returned to the basal level in the persistent infection stage, whereas the expression levels of a small number of genes, such as cell adhesion molecules, were enhanced and they remained higher even in persistently infected cells.

Mapping of RNA-seq reads onto the BmMLV sequence detected BmMLV replication from 24 hpi and rapid propagation from 48 hpi. The growth peaked at 96 hpi and decreased slightly at 2 wpi (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S3A). In persistently infected VF-MLV cells, the BmMLV RNA level declined to about 60% of that found in BmMLV-infected VF cells at 96 hpi (Fig. 2A). These results demonstrate that BmMLV replication begins from 24 hpi, progresses rapidly until 96 hpi and then declines gradually during persistent infection. We also observed that subgenomic RNA markedly accumulated during BmMLV infection (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S3A). The subgenomic RNA is considered to contain two genes cp and p15.2,cp encodes a CP, but it is unknown whether p15 actually encodes a functional protein.2,5 The p15 RNA expression level was much higher than that of cp RNA, especially in VF-MLV cells (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S3A), thereby suggesting that p15 plays an essential role in the establishment of BmMLV infections in silkworm cells. The putative p15 protein lacks high homology with any known proteins including plant maculavirus proteins, but it shares very low homology (E value = 3e-04) with a hypothetical protein of insect iridovirus (accession number YP_009010649), which suggests that it might be required for infection in insect cells. We established a system where infectious BmMLV virions could be produced via the transfection of VF cells with an infectious BmMLV full-length cDNA clone (pHMLV).5 To understand the role of p15 in the establishment of BmMLV infection, we generated two cDNA clones that lacked p15 (pHMLV-<U+0394>p15) or that possessed a Met codon-defective p15 (pHMLV-p15<U+0394>Met + Stop) (Fig. 2C), and we transfected them into VF cells, before examining virus production in the transfected cells by immunoblotting for the CP protein. We observed CP protein expression in pHMLV-transfected VF cells, whereas we did not detect its expression at all in pHMLV-<U+0394>p15- or pHMLV-p15<U+0394>Met + Stop-transfected cells (Fig. 2D). These results demonstrate that p15 protein but not p15 RNA is required for the establishment of BmMLV infections in silkworm cells. p15 is essential for establishing BmMLV infections in silkworm cells.

The GFP fluorescence was photographed under UV light at 5 days postinfiltration.Plant RNA viruses often encode RNA silencing suppressors in order to counterattack against host antiviral silencing.26 To investigate whether p15 protein functions as a RNA silencing suppressor, we performed an Agrobacterium-mediated transient coexpression assay.27 In this conventional assay, suppression of transgene-induced RNA silencing in patches infiltrated with Agrobacterium cells was examined using GFP fluorescence. A plasmid expressing GFP (35S-GFP) and a plasmid expressing BmMLV p15 (35S-P15) were cointroduced into N. benthamiana leaves by agroinfiltration. As negative and positive controls, either ß-glucuronidase (35S-GUS) or the well-characterized RNA silencing suppressor HC-Pro of ZYMV (35S-HC-Pro), respectively, was coexpressed with GFP. As shown in Fig. 2E, coinfiltration with 35S-GFP and 35S-HC-Pro elicited strong green fluorescence as a consequence of suppression of RNA silencing. On the other hand, coinfiltration with 35S-GFP and 35S-P15 or 35S-GUS triggered RNA silencing and resulted in very weak GFP fluorescence (Fig. 2E). These results indicate that BmMLV p15 protein does not work as a viral RNA silencing suppressor in this system. This result, along with the result that CP expression was completely diminished when p15 of the BmMLV infectious cDNA was mutated or deleted (Fig. 2D), suggested that p15 protein is required for BmMLV replication in silkworm cells. Recent studies have identified additional insect macula-like viruses in mosquitoes, honeybees and mites.28,29Culex Tymoviridae-like virus (CuTLV) and Bee Macula-like virus (BeeMLV) possess p16 and p15 genes, which encode proteins with low sequence identities (16.6% and 17.7%, respectively) to BmMLV p15 protein. On the other hand, mite Varroa Tymo-like virus and plant maculaviruses do not possess p15 orthologues. These findings suggest that insect macula-like viruses have acquired and utilized their unique genes to replicate in insect hosts, i.e., silkworm cells, mosquitoes and honeybees.The amount of BmMLV RNA decreased gradually during the establishment of persistent infections in VF cells (Fig. 2A), thereby indicating the existence of a host silencing mechanism against BmMLV. A previous study showed that an RNAi pathway possibly down-regulates the level of BmMLV rdrp RNA in the B. mori ovary-derived BmN-4 cell line30 that is known to be persistently infected with BmMLV.2 Thus exogenous small RNA-mediated pathways might be involved in decreasing BmMLV RNA in persistently infected cells. Since small RNA libraries obtained from BmN-4 cells are available in public databases,31 a search for BmMLV RNA-derived small RNAs was first made by mapping BmN-4 small RNA sequences onto the BmMLV genome. BmMLV RNA-derived small RNAs were found to be expressed from the entire genomic region (Fig. 3A). These viral small RNAs had a very strong sense-strand bias, and few were mapped to the antisense strand (Fig. 3A and B). The small RNAs mapped to the rdrp region varied in length between 20 and 32 nt and they had weak peaks at around 20 nt, which suggests that they belonged to microRNAs (miRNAs) or small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). miRNAs and siRNAs play biological roles by cooperating with Ago1 and Ago2 proteins, respectively.32 We examined the properties of BmMLV-derived Ago2-bound small RNAs using a small RNA library obtained from BmN-4 cells infected with an Ago2-overexpressing baculovirus.33 They were mapped to both strands with a weak sense-strand bias (Fig. 3A), and had a distinct peak at 20 nt (Fig. 3C). Although this data set was obtained under a different condition from ours, bioinformatic analysis indicates that Ago2-bound small RNAs contain BmMLV-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs), which are produced from double-stranded BmMLV RNA-derived precursor RNAs. In addition, a distinct peak in the length distribution of small RNAs mapped to the cp and p15 regions was observed at 27–28 nt (Fig. 3B), which was similar to that observed in the total small RNAs obtained from naïve BmN-4 cells.13,34 These small RNAs are probably piRNAs that repress transposon activity by cooperating with silkworm PIWI proteins, Siwi and BmAgo3.34,35 In the silkworm piRNA biogenesis pathway called ‘ping-pong’ cycle, Siwi and 1U piRNA complexes cleave their complementary targets across from nts 10 and 11 from the guide piRNAs.34 The cleaved 3' RNA fragments are subsequently incorporated into another PIWI protein BmAgo3 and processed into mature secondary piRNAs with adenine at the position 10 (10A), which precisely overlap with 1U piRNAs by 10 nt. To determine whether BmMLV RNA-derived piRNAs (vpiRNAs) were loaded correctly into PIWI proteins, we sequenced Siwi-bound or BmAgo3-bound small RNAs from BmN-4 cells and mapped them onto the BmMLV genome (Fig. 3A). In contrast to the mapping results obtained for the total small RNAs, the Siwi-bound and BmAgo3-bound vpiRNAs mapped exclusively to the subgenomic region, where cp and p15 are encoded (Fig. 3A). The Siwi- and BmAgo3-bound vpiRNAs had a very strong sense-strand bias, and a small proportion of BmAgo3-bound vpiRNAs were mapped to the antisense strand of the subgenomic region (Fig. 3A). Siwi-bound and BmAgo3-bound vpiRNAs had peak length distribution of 28 and 27 nt, respectively (Fig. 3D and E), which are identical to those observed in transposon-derived piRNAs in BmN-4 cells.13 The Siwi-bound sense vpiRNAs exhibited 1U enrichment, whereas the BmAgo3-bound vpiRNAs lacked this bias (Supplementary Fig. S4). Intriguingly, 10A enrichment was observed in both Siwi- and BmAgo3-bound antisense vpiRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S4), which suggests that some of the vpiRNAs are produced via the Siwi : Siwi homotypic ping-pong cycle, instead of the canonical Siwi : BmAgo3 heterotypic ping-pong cycle. This unique biogenesis feature might result in an extremely strong sense-strand bias in BmMLV vpiRNAs (Fig. 3A). Production of BmMLV-derived small RNAs in BmN-4 cells.

Ago1 and Ago2 proteins are required for the miRNA- and siRNA-mediated pathways,32 respectively, whereas Siwi and BmAgo3 are core components of the piRNA machinery in silkworms.34,35 First, we knocked down Siwi or BmAgo3 mRNA in BmN-4 cells, where the knockdown efficiency was verified by RT-qPCR experiments (Supplementary Fig. S5A). As shown in Fig. 4A, the RNA levels of rdrp and cp were higher in Siwi- or BmAgo3-knocked down cells compared with those in the control cells, thereby demonstrating that vpiRNAs are involved in the suppression of BmMLV propagation in BmN-4 cells. Furthermore, we knocked down Ago1 or Ago2 mRNA (Supplementary Fig. S5B) and examined the expression levels of rdrp and cp in the knocked down cells. We observed enhancement of both the rdrp and cp RNA levels in the Ago2-knocked down cells, but knocking down Ago1 mRNA did not affect the levels of BmMLV RNAs (Fig. 4B). To verify whether exogenous siRNA pathway is involved in BmMLV suppression, we knocked down Dicer-2 (Dcr2) which makes siRNAs from long double-stranded RNAs. As shown in Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S5D, we detected cp and rdrp increase in Dcr2-knocked down cells. These results demonstrate that BmMLV replication is suppressed by exogenous piRNA- and siRNA-mediated pathways in BmMLV persistently infected BmN-4 cells. We also observed cell growth inhibition or reduced cell viability in Ago2-, Siwi-, BmAgo3- or Dcr2-knocked down cells (Supplementary Fig. S5C and E). Considering that the percentage of BmMLV RNA-derived RNA-seq reads was surprisingly high, i.e. more than 15% of the total reads in BmN-4 cells (Supplementary Fig. S3B), a few fold increase in the intracellular amounts of BmMLV might be fatal for the growth and viability of BmN-4 cells.

We knocked down four Ago family genes and then infected the knocked down VF cells with BmMLV. The RNA levels of cp and rdrp were enhanced only when Ago2 was knocked down (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S6A). These results clearly demonstrate that BmMLV is repressed by the siRNA pathway, but not by the piRNA pathway in VF cells when transiently infected with BmMLV. To examine whether the siRNA pathway alone mediates BmMLV suppression in VF cells persistently infected with BmMLV, we knocked down each Ago family gene in VF-MLV cells (Supplementary Fig. S6B) and examined the cp and rdrp levels in the knocked down cells. We found that the amount of BmMLV RNA was enhanced only in Ago2-knocked down VF-MLV cells (Fig. 5B), thereby indicating the involvement of the siRNA pathway, but not the piRNA pathway, in the repression of BmMLV replication in VF-MLV cells. Next, we sequenced small RNAs from BmMLV-infected VF cells (0, 24 and 96 hpi) and VF-MLV cells. Few small RNAs obtained from BmMLV-infected VF cells at 0 or 24 hpi mapped to the BmMLV genome (Fig. 5C). At 96 hpi, the BmMLV RNA-derived small RNAs mapped to the entire BmMLV genome and they exhibited a weak sense-strand bias (Fig. 5C). The peak of the length distribution of these small RNAs was 20–21 nt (Fig. 5D–F), thereby suggesting that they were siRNAs or miRNAs. Given the results of the knockdown experiments (Fig. 5A and B), these small RNAs were vsiRNAs. In addition, we sequenced small RNAs prepared from VF-MLV cells and found that the mapping pattern differed markedly from that of BmN-4 cells (Fig. 3A). The peak of the length distribution of these small RNAs was 20–21 nt and a faint broad peak ranging between 26 and 30 nt was observed for both strands (Fig. 5G), which suggests that vpiRNAs accumulated at much lower levels compared with the vsiRNAs in VF-MLV cells. These results confirmed our observation that BmMLV was repressed by the siRNA-mediated pathway but not by the piRNA-mediated pathway in both transiently and persistently infected VF cells (Fig. 5A and B).

First, these two cell lines might simply possess different silencing pathways against foreign elements. BmN-4 is derived from the B. mori ovary6 and it possesses a complete piRNA pathway.34 On the other hand, VF was established from B. mori early embryos,5 but it is unknown whether this cell line possesses the piRNA pathway. Bioinformatics analysis showed that the VF cells actually expressed both piRNA pathway-related genes and transposon-derived piRNAs (data not shown), and thus VF cells also have the potential for piRNA-mediated silencing. Therefore, a second hypothesis is possible, which involves the difference in the virus accumulation level in the two cell lines. BmMLV RNA-derived reads accounted for 15.7% and 8.3% of the total RNA-seq reads in BmN-4 and VF-MLV cells, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S3), which indicates that BmMLV accumulated in BmN-4 cells at about two times the level found in VF-MLV cells. It is possible to speculate that the silencing process against BmMLV developed in two steps: the first is a canonical siRNA-mediated pathway, and then the piRNA-mediated targeting begins when the virus load reaches a certain threshold during persistent infection. If this is the case, then BmMLV will be repressed by both vsiRNAs and vpiRNAs in VF-MLV cells in the future.In general, the de novo production of piRNAs against exogenous elements is considered to require integration into the active piRNA clusters.36–39 In this study, we detected BmMLV RNA-derived vpiRNAs in silkworm BmN-4 cells. Southern blotting and genomic PCR clearly demonstrated that the BmMLV genome is not integrated into the genomes of BmN-4,2 which indicates that BmMLV RNA-derived vpiRNAs are produced in a non-canonical manner. Similar phenomena have been reported in Drosophila ovarian somatic sheet (OSS) cells,40,Aedes mosquitoes and Aedes cell lines.41–45 OSS cells expressed vpiRNAs for several persistently infected RNA viruses,40 whereas Drosophila did not produce vpiRNA during both acute and persistent viral infections, and thus the piRNA pathway is not required for antiviral defense in adult Drosophila.46 On the other hand, piRNA pathways play roles in silencing RNA viruses in both adult Aedes and Aedes cultured cells,45 so the importance of vpiRNA production in antiviral defense systems even differs within the same order (Diptera). In the present study, we discovered that the piRNA pathway also functioned to combat an RNA virus in lepidopteran cultured cells. At present, it is unknown how the host cells recognize non-integrated exogenous elements and produce piRNAs against them, but silkworm and mosquito cells may provide useful systems for exploring this piRNA-mediated silencing mechanism.In conclusion, the present study determined for the first time the molecular interaction between insect cells and a plant virus-like insect RNA virus. We identified both the host and viral factors that are required to establish persistent BmMLV infections in silkworm cultured cells. Silkworm cultured cells negatively regulate viral growth by siRNA and piRNA pathways, which may prevent lethal infection and allow the virus to establish a persistent infection. On the other hand, BmMLV utilizes a novel protein, p15, to propagate itself in insect cells in an unknown manner (Fig. 6). It would be very interesting to understand how the p15 protein controls the host cell machinery during the establishment of virus infections as well as the origin of this protein. A proposed model for the molecular interaction between silkworm cells and BmMLV. Most virus-derived piRNA (vpiRNAs) are produced from sense subgenomic RNAs (sgRNAs), whereas virus-derived siRNAs (vsiRNAs) are generated from double-stranded BmMLV RNA-derived precursor RNAs. These small RNAs prevent lethal infection and allow the virus to establish a persistent infection. On the other hand, BmMLV utilizes p15 protein to propagate itself properly in silkworm cells in an unknown manner.A proposed model for the molecular interaction between silkworm cells and BmMLV.

IntroductionDevelopment of balanced host–microbe interactions is critical for adaptation of newborn infants to their external environment.1 Newborn infants are normally protected from pathogens but allow exposure to a high density of beneficial (commensal) microbes that facilitate normal development of the immune system, in accord with the “hygiene hypothesis”.2 It is not clear how bacterial colonization affects microbe–host interactions in preterm infants that have an immature innate immune system and limited access to protection from mother’s own milk just after birth.3 Up to 10% of all hospitalized preterm infants suffer from necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC), an intestinal inflammatory disease, associated with formula feeding and gut microbiota dysbiosis.4 To prevent NEC, different interventions to manipulate bacterial colonization have been used, including antibiotics (AB), probiotics and prebiotics. Delaying bacterial colonization via oral administration of AB for the first few days after preterm birth decreases NEC incidence in both infants and pigs.5–8 This NEC-preventive treatment is not used in clinical practice, mainly due to concerns of increased antimicrobial resistance. Nevertheless, it is important to investigate the molecular mechanisms responsible for the enhanced adaptation of the immature intestine when gut bacterial colonization is delayed by AB treatment just after preterm birth. This is critical to identify intestinal pathways that are affected by bacterial colonization and new ways to prevent microbe-induced intestinal dysfunction and NEC.Recent research has documented direct connections between microbial metabolites and epigenetic modifications.9,10 For instance, microbiota-derived folate, choline and methionine are involved in the one-carbon metabolism that contributes to the methyl donor, S-adenosylmethionine, for DNA methylation. DNA methylation may regulate gene transcription, cellular differentiation and normal development.11 Therefore, DNA methylation may play an important role in mediating microbe–host interactions in early life, when rapid adaptation of the immature intestine is critical for survival, especially following preterm birth. In newborn mice, germ-free conditions alter the DNA methylation of the colonic epithelium and affect gene activation, and thereby intestinal functions.12 Correspondingly, the intestinal DNA methylome may be affected by the timing, density and diversity of bacterial colonization just after birth in preterm neonates.Using preterm pigs as a model for preterm infants, we applied reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS) for intestinal DNA methylome profiling and 16S rRNA sequencing for microbiome profiling in animals with or without oral AB treatment for 5 days after birth. We observed marked DNA methylation differences between the two groups of pigs associated with differences in the total load and community structure of bacteria. The epigenome data were integrated with proteome data from a previous study, using the same animal model, to gain further insight into the biological pathways that shape the interface between the gut microbiota and intestinal cells.2. Materials and methods2.1. Animals and their treatmentAll animal procedures were approved by the Danish National Committee on Animal Experimentation. Fourteen preterm pigs from three sows (Danish Landrace×Large White×Duroc) were selected from a previous larger study where the phenotypic characteristics have been described in detail.8 All pigs were caesarean-delivered at day 106 (~90% of gestation). Preterm pigs delivered at 90% gestation show intestinal characteristics of human infants delivered at ~70% gestation. Fourteen pigs showing limited or no severe clinical signs of NEC before tissue collection were chosen for this study on DNA methylation patterns. The newborn preterm pigs were immediately transferred to a piglet intensive care unit and reared in temperature- and oxygen-regulated incubators. The pigs were weighed and fitted with umbilical arterial and orogastric catheters and then subject to passive immunization with maternal plasma, as previously described.8 Pigs were subjected to delayed bacterial colonization, using daily oral boluses of broad-spectrum AB (AB group, n = 7), and they were compared with pigs raised conventionally (CON group, n = 7) with spontaneous microbial colonization and daily boluses of saline. For the AB group, the selection of AB and doses were adapted from the current use of AB (intravenous) to preterm infants in Denmark.7,8 Thus, a combination of ampicillin (30 mg/kg BW thrice daily), gentamicin (2.5 mg/kg BW twice daily) and metronidazole (10 mg/kg BW thrice daily) was used to target a broad range of microorganisms.For nutrition, all pigs were initially provided with parenteral nutrition (PN) via the umbilical catheter, supplemented with minimal enteral nutrition (MEN) with formula via the orogastric tube. The PN solution was based on a commercially-available product (Kabiven, Fresenius Kabi, Bad Homburg, Germany), and its composition was adjusted to meet nutritional requirements of preterm pigs, as previously described.7 The formula diet consisted of three products commonly used for infants (per litre of water: 75 g Liquigen MCT, 80 g Pepdite and 70 g Arla DI-9224; from Nutricia, Allerød, Denmark, and Arla Food Ingredients, Viby J, Denmark, respectively). The provision of MEN was initiated within 5 h of delivery as boluses of 3 ml/kg every 3 h on days 1–2. On day 3, PN supply was stopped and total enteral nutrition with formula was provided as boluses of 15 ml/kg every 3 h until euthanasia and tissue collection on day 5.2.2. Tissue collection, intestinal morphology and inflammatory cytokine analysisThe pigs were euthanized with sodium pentobarbital (200 mg/kg, i.a.). The gastrointestinal tract was immediately removed, and the small intestine was carefully emptied of its contents and weighed. Pieces of the distal small intestine (83% along the length of the small intestine) were snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and kept at  -80°C for subsequent analysis of the DNA methylome and inflammatory cytokines. IL-8 levels in the distal small intestine were analysed with ELISA (R&D Systems, Abingdon, Oxfordshire, UK) following the manufacturer’s instructions and measured as picograms per milligram of wet tissue. In addition, two 1-cm pieces were collected and fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for histological analysis. The paraformaldehyde-fixed samples were embedded in paraffin, sectioned (5 µm), mounted on slides and stained with haematoxylin and eosin. Representative cross-sections were selected from each pig, and at least 10 well-oriented crypts and villi were measured using an Axiophot microscope (Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and NIH image software version 1.60 (softWoRx Explorer version 1.1; Applied Precision, Issaquah, WA). To estimate the epithelial cell proportion in the small intestine tissue from each group, we examined cross sections of the distal small intestine by immunohistochemistry using the epithelial cell marker, cytokeratin (DAKO M3515). Staining was developed with UltraVision LP Detection System (ThermoFisher Scientific). The sections were counterstained with Mayer’s haematoxylin. Images were acquired using the OlyVIA software (OLYMPUS, version 2.9) and the proportion (%) of the positive staining for cytokeratin in cross-sectional area was analysed by the IHC toolbox in ImageJ.2.3. Organic acids and microbiota analysisThe luminal contents of the colon were subjected to organic acid (short-chain fatty acid, SCFA) concentration measurements, using gas chromatography and total bacterial load was quantified using RT-qPCR, as previously described.13 The luminal contents of the distal small intestine were collected for the analysis of gut microbiota. In brief, total DNA was extracted from the distal small intestinal contents, and the v3-v4 hypervariable regions of the 16S rRNA sequence were amplified with PCR. The resultant amplicons were sequenced using the Illumina MiSeq system (Illumina, San Diego, CA), producing paired-end reads. The microbiota community structure was analysed with Mothur, based on the official protocol developed by the Mothur developers.14 The optimized reads were clustered into operational taxonomic units (OTUs), and representative sequences were aligned to the SILVA reference (version: SILVA123). The OTU annotation results were employed to determine the microorganism composition in each sample.2.4. Reduced representation bisulphite sequencing (RRBS)Genomic DNA was extracted from the 14 rinsed intact pieces of distal intestine, using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen) and subjected to RRBS library preparation, as previously described.15 We used whole intestinal tissue samples because whole tissue responses likely better represented the in vivo state of the intestine, with all the interacting cell types, than just isolated cell types (e.g. enterocytes, goblet cells, enteroendocrine cells). In brief, 1.5 µg of genomic DNA was digested with the MspI enzyme (NEB), followed by end repair, A-base tailing and 5-methylcytosine-modified adapter ligation. Size selection was performed to obtain DNA fractions of MspI-digested products in the range of 40–250 bp. Subsequently, bisulphite treatment was conducted using the ZYMO EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit following the manufacturer’s instructions. Twelve cycles of PCR were performed to enrich the DNA fragments, in which each library was integrated with the DNA index. The libraries were analysed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and qPCR for quality control. The libraries were then subjected to paired-end 125 bp multiplex sequencing on the HiSeq 2500 platform. Raw sequencing data were processed via the Illumina base-calling pipeline. Low-quality reads that contained more than 30% ‘N’s or showed a low-quality value (quality value <20) in over 10% of the sequence were omitted from the data analysis. The bisulphite sequence MAPping program (BSMAP)16 was used for sequence alignment to the Ensembl pig reference genome (Sscrofa10.2). The methylation levels of individual cytosines were calculated as the ratio of the sequenced depth of the ascertained methylated CpG cytosines to the total sequenced depth of individual CpG cytosines.2.5. Illumina hiseq sequencing-based bisulphite sequencing PCR (BSP)Gene-specific DNA methylation was assessed by BSP, according to a previously published method.17 IN brief, BSP primers were designed using the online MethPrimer software and listed in Supplementary Table S1. Genomic DNA (500 ng) was converted using the ZYMO EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit (ZYMO) and one-tenth of the elution products were used as templates for PCR amplification. For each sample, BSP products of multiple genes were generated, pooled equally and subjected to adaptor ligation. Barcoded libraries from all 14 samples were sequenced on the Hiseq platform using paired-end 250 bp strategy. Data were processed and analysed using BSMAP, as described above.2.6. Statistical analysisFor phenotypic values, bacterial load, SCFA and cytokine data, comparisons between the two groups were conducted using Student’s t-test, and a two-tailed P-value <0.05 was considered statistically significant. The correlation between the log-transformed relative abundance of the microbiota and concentration of SCFAs was assessed using Spearman’s rank correlation test. A two-sided P-value <0.05 was regarded as statistically significant. Differentially methylated positions (DMPs) were identified according to the methylation levels of cytosines between samples from the two groups using the Mann–Whitney U-test. DMPs showing a mean methylation difference >0.2 and a P-value <0.01 were considered statistically significant. To identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs), pairs of significant DMPs were used to delimit regions exhibiting homogeneous methylation changes, and the interval methylation levels between the two groups were tested using the Mann–Whitney U-test, with a false discovery rate of <0.05. For gene expression analysis, RT-qPCR analysis was performed using QuantiTect SYBR Green PCR Kit (Qiagen) on LightCycler 480 (Roche). Relative quantification of target genes was normalized to housekeeping gene HPRT1 (Supplementary Table S2). Comparisons were made using the Student’s t-test and a two-tailed P-value <0.05 was considered as statistically significant.3. Results3.1. Phenotypic effects of AB treatment in preterm pigsPigs from the two groups in this study were subgroups of pigs from a larger study where detailed clinical characteristics and phenotypic variables have been published previously.8 At autopsy, none of the AB pigs had any NEC lesions in their intestines, while two of seven CON pigs were diagnosed as NEC according to our macroscopic NEC evaluation system.18 One of these NEC pigs showed colon lesions (haemorrhage, local necrosis, pneumatosis intestinalis, NEC score 5) while the other NEC pig showed both colon and distal intestine lesions (severe, extensive pneumatosis intestinalis, haemorrhage, necrosis, NEC score 6). All the AB pigs were given a NEC score of 1, reflecting no visible lesions or abnormalities (Fig. 1a). Histological analysis of the distal small intestine revealed clear villus atrophy in the pig diagnosed as NEC in the distal intestine (Fig. 1b). Compared with CON pigs, the AB pigs showed a higher growth velocity and lower crypt depth (both P < 0.05), but no change in villus height (Fig. 1c). To assess the approximate proportion of epithelial cells, immunohistochemical analyses of the epithelial marker cytokeratin was performed on cross sections of distal small intestine. No significant difference in the proportion of epithelial cells was observed between AB and CON pigs (44.1 vs. 42.2%, P = 0.38, Supplementary Fig. S1).

We then analysed the microbial composition from their intestinal contents using 16S rRNA microbiome sequencing. Data from two pigs in the AB group were omitted due to insufficient reads for OTU annotation. Based on the remaining 12 samples, there was lower inter-individual diversity of the intestinal microbiota in AB versus CON pigs. The two NEC pigs from the CON group was dominated by Clostridium and showed marked compositional difference from the other pigs, as indicated by hierarchical clustering (Fig. 1e). The five healthy pigs from CON group were dominated by Enterococcus and Enterobacter, while most AB pigs were dominated by Enterobacter, except for one pig that was dominated by Staphylococcus (Fig. 1e). Hence, in addition to a decreased total bacterial count, the AB pigs had less abundance of Gram-positive bacteria (Clostridium and Enterococcus) than the NEC and healthy pigs from the CON group, i.e. CON–NEC and CON–Healthy pigs, respectively. Previous studies show that stool samples from preterm infants that develop NEC are dominated by Firmicutes, especially Enterococcus in the early postnatal period.19,20 Therefore, the dominant Enterococcus in CON–Healthy pigs might imply a risk of developing NEC, although normal intestinal morphology was observed in these pigs at autopsy. The level of interleukin 8 (IL-8), a biomarker of NEC in both human infants and rats,21–23 was elevated in the distal intestine of these CON–Healthy pigs (P < 0.05, Fig. 1f). Finally, colonic lactate concentrations, known to be elevated in association with NEC,18 was markedly increased in the CON–Healthy pigs (P < 0.0001, Fig. 1g). The lactate concentration was positively correlated with the relative abundance of Enterococcus (<U+03C1> = 0.61, P < 0.05).3.2. DNA methylation profile in preterm pig intestineNext, we evaluated the DNA methylome of the small intestine in the AB and CON groups via RRBS, which was developed to measure the DNA methylation of high-CG regions at a single base-pair resolution. As we applied a 125-bp paired-end sequencing strategy, MspI-digested fragments of the RRBS library were expanded to 40–250 bp. As a result, we generated a total of 57.65 gigabases (Gb) of clean bases from 14 libraries after quality control analyses. Using the BSMAP, we found that 68.0% of the clean reads could be mapped to the pig reference genome, reaching an average read depth of 8.71–13.59 per strand for each sample. The bisulphite conversion rate of C–to-T reached 99.6%, as calculated based on the methylated level of lambda DNA (Supplementary Table S3). As RRBS enriches high-CpG regions in the genome and mammalian DNA methylation occurs almost exclusively at CGs, we focused on analyses of CpG methylation. Only the CpG sites showing 4× or more coverage per strand were analysed to maintain a high accuracy level for methylation levels, resulting in an average of 4.66 million CpG sites being covered in the analyses for each of the samples. The pig genome contains 56.06 million CpGs, and we therefore managed to examine ~8.31% of all CpGs in the pig genome using this representation strategy.DNA methylation might be biased towards specific alleles in specific genomic regions owing to gene imprinting.24 To address this issue, we applied two methods to analyse allele-specific methylation (ASM) across 14 samples, including an AMR-based method25 and an SNP calling-based method referred to as “SMAP”.26 By integrating the results from these two methods, we sought to reveal genomic regions that most likely showed differential methylation between paternal and maternal genomes, and we checked whether these regions of genomic imprinting could be affected by AB usage. However, no significant differences in ASM levels were observed between the two groups, indicating that the administered oral AB and the different colonization levels had no effect on ASM (Supplementary Fig. S2, data not shown).3.3. Genome-wide DNA methylation changesBased on the above analyses, we next sought to infer the changes in intestinal genomic methylation in response to delayed microbial colonization by AB treatment just after preterm birth. To avoid the potentially confounding influence of X chromosome inactivation on DNA methylation patterns between male and female neonates, only autosomal data were used in this study hereafter. We first examined the global pattern of genome-wide methylation. Hierarchical clustering and principal component analysis (PCA) of the methylation levels of all CpG sites were performed to examine the whole-genome methylation status of these samples. Both clustering and PCA results indicated that the two groups were not clearly separated into two clusters owing to individual epigenomic variation (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. S3). However, based on the average methylation levels observed across all samples, genic regions showed clear divergence between the two groups, suggesting differences in specific genomic regions or CpG sites (Supplementary Fig. S4). Thereby we next carried out pair-wise comparisons to screen for DMPs between the two groups across the whole genome. This revealed 3,850 CpG sites to be DMPs exhibiting methylation level differences of greater than 20% (Fig. 2b). Among these DMPs, 46.6% were distributed within genic regions, including gene body regions or putative regulatory elements of promoters (2 kb upstream and 500 bp downstream from the transcription start sites—TSS).

(d) Correlation between RRBS and BSP data. (e) Heat map depicting the hierarchical clustering of DMR-associated genes for each preterm pig.Based on the identification of DMPs, we further screened for key genome-wide DMRs that can potentially affect gene functions (see Materials and methods). A total of 87 DMRs were identified in the AB versus CON groups (Supplementary Table S4). Compared with the CON group, 47 DMRs were hypomethylated in the AB group. These DMRs were distributed across all the autosomes, with an average length of 47 base pairs. Based on the current gene annotation for the pig genome, 48 DMRs were associated with putative promoters or intragenic regions (Supplementary Table S4 and Fig. 2c). There were 39 genes with gene symbols that were ascertainable from the Ensembl database. Two genes (NNAT and MEST) were recognized as imprinted genes according to an online imprinting gene database (http://www.geneimprint.com (11 January 2018, date last accessed)) and were excluded from the subsequent analyses. To confirm the observed DNA methylation variations, BSP was performed on five genes with DMRs in either putative promoter or gene body. Examination on all individual cytosines within the five genes revealed significant correlation between the RRBS and BSP data (P < 0.0001, R2 = 0.78, Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. S5). According to hierarchical clustering by individual methylation level of the DMRs in these 37 genes, the AB and CON pigs were grouped into two distinct clusters (Fig. 2e). Within the CON group, the two NEC pigs and five healthy pigs were not clearly separated. This suggests that NEC lesions observed on day 5 did not markedly affect the intestinal methylation status.3.4. Integrated methylome–proteome analysesWe next sought to evaluate the functional significance of the identified DMRs. Considering DNA methylation plays an important role for transcription regulation, it is expected that divergent DNA methylation will ultimately lead to changes of protein expression and further trigger changes of cellular functions via protein–protein interactions. To address this possibility, we applied a previously published proteome data set with a series of differentially expressed proteins following antibiotic treatment of preterm pigs for five days after birth27 (Supplementary Table S5). This study used an identical treatment protocol except that the AB were provided both orally and systemically. As DNA methylation at TSS is associated with transcription silencing while the mechanism of methylation in other genomic regions is less known, we selected genes (ARAP1, CPN1, DHCR7, HOXA2, TRMU and ssc-mir-126) containing DMRs adjacent to TSSs and searched BioGRID database for their potential interactions with the divergently expressed proteins obtained from the proteome data. We found that four genes (ARAP1, CPN1, DHCR7 and HOXA2) were involved in extensive protein–protein interaction networks, in which 78 proteins showed either direct or indirect interaction with each other (Fig. 3a). Among these four genes, CPN1 showed direct interaction with complement component 3 (C3), which is an important constituent of the innate immune system that enhances phagocytosis to clear microbes. As CPN1 functions as a suppressor of C3,28 and was hypomethylated in its promoter region (Fig. 3b), it could be therefore up-regulated, leading to decreased C3 expression in the AB group. To test this, we examined the mRNA expression levels of both CPN1 and C3 from a larger set of samples from the original study,8 including 14 pigs from the AB group and 14 pigs from the CON group (of which 8 had NEC and 6 were healthy). Relative to the CON pigs (both CON–healthy and CON–NEC), the AB pigs showed significantly decreased C3 level (Fig. 3c). However, in agreement with the gene expression database,29 the qPCR results showed very low CPN1 expression levels in the small intestine, preventing detailed comparisons between groups (Supplementary Fig. S6). Nevertheless, consistent with that C3 was reduced in the AB pigs, lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) and neutrophil chemotactic factor IL-8 were also reduced in the AB pigs (Fig. 3d). We examined the proportion of neutrophils by immunohistochemical analyses on cross sections of distal small intestine, using the neutrophil marker, myeloperoxidase (MPO). The number of MPO-positive cells among the overall cell population was small and 3.6 versus 4.7 per villus in the AB and CON groups, respectively (P = 0.08, Supplementary Fig. S7). Together with the reduced IL-8 levels, this suggests that that innate immune response was less activated in the AB pigs. Methylome-proteome network analyses.

(c, d) Relative expression of genes in the distal intestine, presented as mean values ± SEM (*P < 0.05; **P < 0.01; ***P < 0.001; ****P < 0.0001).Furthermore, we employed the genes that were differentially expressed in protein level together with all the DMR-associated genes to perform functional enrichment analysis. In agreement with the above results, we found that 2 of the 11 significantly enriched KEGG pathways (Supplementary Table S6) were related to ‘bacterial infection’, including ‘legionellosis’ and ‘pathogenic Escherichia coli infection’. These two pathways were both related to Gram-negative bacteria, supporting the change in LBP expression (Fig. 3d). Interestingly, we also revealed five metabolism-related pathways and four pathways related to vascular functions. Previous studies indicated that the recruitment of immune cells and phagocytosis might result in local depletion of oxygen, which could further trigger a stress response that increases angiogenesis and induces metabolic changes to compensate for oxygen deficits.30–32 We found that, within the glycolysis and gluconeogenesis pathways, the glycolytic enzyme aldolase A (encoded by ALDOA) was down-regulated in the AB group. In contrast, the gluconeogenesis regulatory enzymes fructose-1, 6-bisphosphatase 1 (encoded by FBP1) and mitochondrial PEP-carboxykinase (encoded by PCK2) were up-regulated in the AB group (Supplementary Fig. S8). Together, the enriched KEGG pathways indicate that delayed bacterial colonization following AB treatment may affect intestinal oxygenation, vascular function and tissue metabolism.3.5. Hypoxia-associated vascular endothelial functionsBased on above results, we further studied in greater detail some genes related to possible hypoxia and altered vascular functions of the immature intestine of AB and CON pigs. This is relevant as innate immunity is linked with hypoxia, and hypoxia induces angiogenesis.33,34 Under hypoxic conditions, the expression of hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF1A) will be triggered to mediate the hypoxia response of cells.33,34 We therefore quantified the mRNA expression of HIF1A in the small intestines. Consistent with this, HIF1A expression was reduced in AB versus CON pigs (Fig. 4a). Increased HIF1A expression may stimulates vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 2 (VEGFR2) signalling in order to trigger angiogenesis and compensate for an oxygen deficit.31 In this study, we did not observe any differences in VEGFA and VEGFR2 expression between CON and AB pigs (Fig. 4a). Previous studies suggested that lack of VEGFR2 signalling facilitated NEC.35 This result might indicate these CON pigs also failed to activate the VEGFR2 signalling pathway under hypoxic condition. Another effect of hypoxia is on the vascular tone pathway. Our KEGG analyses had indicated several DMR-associated genes involved in the vasodilation-related pathways, including GNAS and MRVI1 (Supplementary Table S6), which belong to the G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) signalling pathway. GNAS encodes for stimulatory G-protein alpha subunit (Gs-a) while MRVI1 (also called IRAG), had been shown to prevent calcium release within the GPCR signalling and thus contributes to vasodilation.36,37 RT-qPCR results showed the mRNA expression of GNAS and MRVI1 also tended to be decreased in the AB pigs versus NEC pigs, though not significantly (Supplementary Fig. S6).

(b) Three genes (ssc-mir-126, PTPRE, LRP8), related to endothelial homeostasis showed hypomethylation in the promoters or gene bodies in the AB pigs.Finally, we investigated in detail three DMR-associated genes potentially related to endothelial homeostasis. MicroRNA-126 is essential for vascular integrity and inhibits haemorrhage,38 PTPRE negatively regulates endothelial cell proliferation39 and LRP8 initiates endothelial antiapoptosis.40 The DMRs in these genes were all hypomethylated in the AB versus CON pigs (Supplementary Table S4). The DMR within the putative promoter region of MicroRNA-126 was located in the intron of EGFL7 and contained four CpGs (Fig. 4b). Hypomethylation of this region may increase the transcription of MicroRNA-126 and there was a tendency to up-regulation of MicroRNA-126 in the AB pigs (P = 0.29, Fig. 4a). In contrast, PTPRE and LRP8 contained the DMRs within their intron and exon, respectively (Fig. 4b). The DMR in LRP8 also co-localized with a CpG island. The expression of PTPRE was decreased in AB versus CON pigs especially when compared with NEC pigs (P < 0.05, Fig. 4a). The expression of LRP8 was too low to be accurately measured in the small intestine in both groups (Supplementary Fig. S6), as confirmed by the gene database.294. DiscussionThe initial bacterial colonization of gut in early life of infants is critical because the microbiota shapes development of immunity and has effects on metabolism.1 The molecular mechanisms whereby this occurs remain obscure but bacterial products, such as fermentation metabolites, may affect host cells via epigenetic modifications.41 Using preterm pigs as a model for preterm infants, we have demonstrated that differences in bacterial colonization of the immature small intestine induce marked changes in gene expression that are regulated by epigenetic mechanisms. A delay in bacterial colonization, resulting from a relatively modest AB-induced reduction in bacterial density in the small intestine over the first 5 days, caused changes to DNA methylation for intestinal genes related to improved innate immune response, hypoxia-related vascular function and tissue metabolism. These apparent beneficial effects are targets to help prevent the immature intestine from detrimental responses to invading bacteria after preterm birth. Among the CON-reared pigs, the observed intestinal methylation and gene expression levels were similar for pigs with and without NEC lesions, indicating that even moderate differences in intestinal bacterial colonization and density (e.g. 106 versus 108 bacteria), not NEC lesions, was the main factor affecting methylation of genes in the immature intestine just after birth.Preliminary evidence for a dynamic crosstalk between the intestinal methylome and bacterial colonization after birth has been derived from rodents.12,42 The preterm pig is the only model of preterm infants that combines a high sensitivity to intestinal disorders (NEC, feeding intolerance) with many other physiological signs of preterm birth (e.g. respiratory dysfunction, cardiovascular impairments, metabolic dysfunction).18 Recent studies have demonstrated a high similarity of both DNA methylation patterns and gut microbiomes between pigs and humans, supporting that pigs are highly relevant biomedical models for study of human diseases.43–45 In this study, we investigated sections of the distal small intestine because this intestinal region is most commonly affected by NEC lesions, highly populated with bacteria and critical for immune development and bacterial tolerance. Maladaptation to feeding and bacterial colonization in preterm neonates (e.g. NEC) involves all cell types and layers of the small intestine, hence we investigated whole tissue rather than isolated cell populations. Five days after preterm birth, when intestinal lesions were relatively mild in control pigs, the proportion of epithelial cells was similar in the two groups, as indicated by our staining of intestinal cross sections. The short-term AB treatment did not induce any marked change in the already low proportion of neutrophils in the epithelium, and in a previous study a similar AB treatment did not affect the proportion of intestinal goblet cells 7. The observed DNA methylation changes are therefore unlikely to result from microbiota-dependent changes in the relative cell proportions in the immature intestinal mucosa during the first 5 days after birth.Microbial community dysbiosis is an important factor for neonatal gut health and preterm infants with a gut dominated by Firmicutes in the first days after birth may later develop NEC.19,20 In this study, the CON-reared pigs were also dominated by Firmicutes (Enterococcus and Clostridium) on day 5, while all AB-treated pigs were protected from NEC lesions and dominated by Enterobacter. Compared with CON pigs, LBP, IL-8 and C3 were reduced in the distal intestine of AB-treated pigs. LBP is a pattern recognition receptor transferring a variety of ligands from both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria to the host through toll-like receptors (e.g. TLR2 and TLR4).46 The chemokine IL-8 can be induced both by TLR247 and TLR448 and recruits immune cells towards the site of infection. C3 labels the pathogen to facilitate phagocytosis to clear bacteria, including Enterococcus.49 Reduced expression of these genes indicates less need to mount an innate immune response in the AB-treated pigs.Our results demonstrated clear effects of an AB-induced delay in bacterial colonization on intestinal DNA methylation and expression of selected genes. The integrative methylome–proteome analysis revealed that genes involved in bacterial infection, vasodilation-related pathways and metabolic pathways were most affected. These affected functions may be closely associated with differential degree of intestinal hypoxia, induced by variable innate immune response to invading bacteria. Normally, immune cell recruitment to sites of infection and induction of phagocytosis consume excessive oxygen, and induce angiogenesis and glycolysis to compensate for the oxygen deficit.30–32 Accordingly, we observed decreases in C3 and HIF1A transcription in the AB versus CON group. The suppressor of C3, CPN1, might be more expressed due to promoter hypomethylation in response to AB treatment. Similarly, MicroRNA-126 expression tended to be increased in the AB group, probably due to promoter hypomethylation. In mice and zebra fish, loss of MicroRNA-126 impacts endothelial cell proliferation and vascular integrity, resulting in fragile and leaky vessels.50,51 On the other hand, the intragenic DMR of PTPRE was hypomethylated in the AB group together with reduced expression levels. This may be explained by the general positive correlation between gene-body methylation and gene expression observed previously.52 PTPRE is highly abundant in endothelial cells and its down-regulation may indicate increased endothelial proliferation in AB versus CON pigs.39Finally, our results indicated that AB treatment reduced glycolysis and increased gluconeogenesis-related gene expression in the AB group (Supplementary Fig. S8). These effects may be a direct consequence of the decreased tissue hypoxia and less need for activation of innate immune response to combat invading bacteria in the AB group. Effects on tissue metabolism were also supported by DNA methylation differences in genes related to metabolism. For example, the putative promoters of DHCR7 and TRMU showed hypomethylation in the AB group, indicating up-regulation of these two genes. DHCR7 encodes for 7-dehydrocholesterol reductase that produces cholesterol using NADPH, a cofactor used in anabolic reactions. Similarly, TRMU encodes for the mitochondrial tRNA-specific 2-thiouridylase 1 that is closely related with mitochondrial function.53 Thus, the potential up-regulation of DHCR7 and TRMU could be associated with active energy consumption in the intestine of AB pigs without hypoxic stress. In conclusion, a delay in bacterial colonization by oral AB treatment just after preterm birth may provide lower innate immune response, less hypoxic stress, better vascular integrity and increased metabolism in the immature intestine via epigenetic mechanisms.We thank Thomas Thymann, Elin Skytte, Kristina Møller, Jane Povlsen and Karina Ryom for their technical support with animal procedures and laboratory analyses.FundingThis study was supported by the Danish Strategic Research Council [NEOMUNE program, 12-132401], the Agricultural Science and Technology Innovation Program (ASTIP), and the China Scholarship Council [Scholarship No. 201406150073 to X.P.].

IntroductionAs early as 5,000 years ago, Chinese rice wine (Huangjiu) was being consumed by people as a fermented alcoholic beverage.1 Chinese rice wine is made from sticky rice, which is different from other beverages made from malt or fruit. The streamed sticky rice was saccharified by raw wheat koji (a variety of Aspergillus) and fermented to generate alcohol by yeast strain. Nowadays, Chinese rice wine is still hugely popular in China due to its pleasant taste, and high nutritional and pharmacological value.2 However, some harmful byproducts are generated during the fermentation and storage of Chinese rice wine, such as ethyl carbamate (EC),3 a genotoxic carcinogen of widespread occurrence in fermented food and beverages, with particularly high concentrations in stone fruit spirits.4,5 In Chinese rice wine, EC is mainly generated from the reaction of ethanol and urea, and its concentration can reach 160 µg/kg.3 As increasing attention is paid to food safety problems, some researchers have focused on the mechanism of EC formulation in Chinese rice wine, and attempts to reduce its concentration have been made.3,6–8Over the past few decades, researchers have identified proteins responsible for the uptake and catabolism of poorly utilized nitrogen sources such as proline and urea, and found that their genes are repressed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae cells cultured in a nitrogen-rich environment. Conversely, in nitrogen-deficient conditions, their transcription is derepressed. This regulatory phenomenon has been termed nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR).9–11 During the accumulation of EC in wine fermentation, NCR plays an important role in the accumulation urea, the major precursor of EC, by repressing the transcription of urea catabolism-related genes. NCR is reportedly controlled by complicated regulatory systems, such as global GATA family regulators,12 the TOR pathway,13 and the Ssy1p-Ptr3p-Ssy5p sensing pathway.14 However, the exact regulatory mechanism of NCR is still unclear. Above all, a complete genome sequence is fundamental for understanding the genetic and regulatory systems of Chinese rice wine strains. The draft genome sequence of S. cerevisiae Chinese rice wine strain YHJ7 has been published,15 which is closely related to the industrial N85 strain (Supplementary Fig. S1). However, there are still many gaps in the YHJ7 assembly, and detailed annotation of the genome is not available.In the mid-2000s, the emergence of next-generation sequencing (NGS) platforms dramatically reduced the run time and cost (around US $1000 for the human genome) of genome sequencing, and increased the throughput to hundreds of Gbp per run16 compared with first-generation sequencing platforms (Sanger sequencers). However, high/low G + C regions, tandem repeat regions, and interspersed repeat regions remain difficult to sequence using NGS platforms.16 Furthermore, the limited read length from NGS platforms can prohibit sequencing completeness and the accuracy of analysis, resulting in assemblies that are incomplete and fragmented into several thousand contigs.15,17 In 2011, PacBio RS II was developed as the first commercially available third-generation sequencer and it was marketed to address this issue. The system uses a novel and unique single molecule real-time (SMRT) technology which enables the generation of long reads (half of reads >20 kb, maximum read length >60 kb) and reduces the degree of bias (even coverage across regions of differing G + C content).18 Because long reads can easily handle complex regions such as repeats, PacBio long reads have the potential to provide accurate and improved genome assemblies.19In this study, a gapless, near-finished genome sequence of the S. cerevisiae Chinese rice wine N85 strain was achieved by combining second- and third-generation sequencing technologies. Complex approaches were performed to assemble and annotate the N85 genome, and over 6,000 proteins and 238 long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) were identified. Moreover, many genomic variants were identified that could be responsible for genomic evolution. The first complete genome sequence of Chinese rice wine brewing yeast, strain N85, is a milestone in studying Chinese rice wine, as well as other related beverages brewing. It will help to understand the evolutionary history of beverage brewing strains and improve the complicated brewing processes from a traditional and experiential way to a modern and scientific way. In addition, further detail analysis of the genome of strain N85 will provide more genetic information for improvement the general quality of Chinese rice wine.2. Materials and methods2.1. Yeast strain and growth conditionsSaccharomyces cerevisiae strain N85 (MATa/a) was the strain generally used for Chinese rice wine production and provided by Guyuelongshan wine company (Shaoxing, China), one of the biggest and oldest Chinese rice wine producer. The yeast strain was pre-cultured on YPD plates (10 g/l yeast extract, 20 g/l peptone, 20 g/l glucose, 20 g/l agar) at 30°C for 24 h. A single colony was activated in YPD media (30°C, 200 rpm) then grown in sole nitrogen medium (1.7 g/l yeast nitrogen base, 20 g/l glucose, 10 mM each of glutamine, arginine, and urea). All cultivations were performed in shake flasks (200 rpm) at 30°C and growth was monitored by determining the optical density at 600 nm (OD600).2.2. DNA and RNA sequencingFollowing a 1 h incubation under the conditions described above, genomic DNA and RNA was isolated as described previously in.15 DNA/RNA quantity was determined using a Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific, MA, USA) and integrity was determined with an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer (Palo Alto, CA). For NGS of genomic DNA, the libraries were constructed using Nextera DNA sample preparation kit (Illumina, CA, USA). Next, libraries were sequenced using MiSeq reagent kit v3 (Illumina, CA, USA) on MiSeq platform, or TruSeq SBS kit v3-HS (Illumina, CA, USA) on HiSeq 2000 platform. For third generation DNA sequencing, the DNA sample was sequenced using the PacBio RS II technology with a C2 chemistry sequencing kits (Pacific Biosciences, Melon Park, CA). For RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq), all RNA samples were prepared as biological duplicates and subjected to removal of rRNA or Poly-A filtering before cDNA library generation. From these libraries, 100 bp paired-end or strand-specific reads were produced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000. Library preparation and sequencing of DNA and RNA on the Illumina platform was performed at BioMarker Inc. (Beijing, China), and the PacBio sequencing was performed at Shanghai Bohao Inc (Shanghai, China).2.3. Genome assemblyThe genome of strain N85 was assembled using two approaches, one using a classical reference assembly, and the other using a hybrid de novo assembly (Supplementary Fig. S2). The hybrid strategy for genome assembly was carried out in three distinct and contiguous steps: (i) de novo generation of contigs; (ii) ordering of the de novo contigs generated and their concatenation into supercontigs; (iii) closing of the remaining gaps using a de novo iterative approach. Specifically, regarding the reference-guided genome assembly, filtered short reads were used for direct alignment to the publically-available S. cerevisiae S288c (version Scer3) and YHJ7 genome sequences using the CLC Genomics Workbench version v8.0 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/products/clc-genomics-workbench/ (19 January 2018, date last accessed)). Regarding the hybrid de novo assembly, de novo genome assembly was first performed using one or both of the PacBio and Illumina datasets by several methods, including the CLC Genomics Workbench version v8.0, A5-miseq v2,20 SSPACE-LongRead v1.1,21 SPAdes v3.5.0,22 PBcR,23 and hierarchical genome assembly process (HGAP) v2.0.24 Second, the order and orientation of contigs from the de novo assembly were determined by aligning contigs to the reference-guided assembly with a minimum identity value of 90% between the de novo contigs and the reference genome using CLC Genomics Workbench version v8.0 software. In this manner, most de novo contigs could be concatenated into supercontigs by overlapping regions.2.4. Genome annotationGene features were annotated in the high-quality genome sequence using three different approaches: ab initio, evidence-, and homology-based predictions (Supplementary Fig. S3). For the ab initio prediction, AUGUSTUS v3.0.325 was employed with the predefined parameter set for the S. cerevisiae genome. For the evidence-based prediction of transcripts, two annotation methods were performed; one used TopHat226 to map RNA-Seq reads to the N85 genome with default parameters to identify the possible location of introns and exons27 that were subsequently integrated in a hint-based run of AUGUSTUS; the other used TRINITY28 to run mapping-free transcript assembly with the RNA-Seq data. For the homology-based prediction of transcripts, S288c open reading frames (ORFs) downloaded from Saccharomyces genome database (SGD), and exonerate29 was employed to align the ORFs to the genome of strain N85.To compare coding differences between N85 and S288c, local BLASTp searches were carried out using the amino acid sequences of the predicted ORFs as queries, and amino acid sequences of all ORFs in the S288c as database. The following threshold settings were used: e-value < 1 × 10-5, identity >80%, and an alignment length >50%.2.5. Detection of isoforms and ncRNAsFor the detection of lncRNAs, Tophat2 was used for spliced read mapping with the following non-standard parameters: ‘no-mixed’, ‘no-discordant’, ‘b2-very-sensitive’, ‘max-intron-length 10 100’, and for strand-specific samples ‘libtype fr-first strand’. The number of reads within exons and genes were calculated by using the Cufflinks pipeline,26 used as gene expression values, and normalized using the number of reads per kilobase on exon regions per million mapped reads. Alternative splicing events (isoforms) were also predicted using the Cufflinks software,26 and mapped reads were visualized with SpliceGrapher.30 All identified isoforms and ncRNAs were manually checked using integrative genomics viewer.312.6. Detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms and analysis of copy-number compare with S288cTo estimate the genetic distance between the N85 and S288c reference strains, all Illumina reads were mapped to reference genomes using BWA-MEM.32 Biallelic single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were called by the SAMtools v0.1.19 ‘mpileup’ command and the VCFutils ‘varFilter’ command with ‘-D 200 -d 5’.Per-position read counts were calculated from BAM files of mapped reads using the ‘gennomecov’ utility of BEDTools v2.15.0.33 Reads were counted using a sliding window (1 kb) and used to find copy-number variations (CNVs). CNVs were identified using HMMcopy,34 based on the ReadDepth method. To control false-positives, only CNVs with a length >2 kb were selected. The boundaries of CNVs were confirmed by visual inspection in the integrated genome viewer. We calculated the overlap of each gene with SNPs/CNVs from gene ontology (GO) gene sets using FungiFun2 (https://elbe.hki-jena.de/fungifun/fungifun.php (19 January 2018, date last accessed)). Bonferroni adjusted P-values and the false discovery rate were recorded.2.7. Analysis of the genome variations between N85 and sake strainsThe genome sequences of sake strains K7 and K11 were downloaded from SGD (http://www.yeastgenome.org/ (19 January 2018, date last accessed)). The differences between Chinese rice wine strain N85 and sake strains K7 and K11 were analysed at contig and sequencing read levels. First, the genome sequences of strain K7 and K11 were compared with that of strain N85 through local BLASTn with parameters as follows: -outfmt 17 -evalue 1e-5 -num_threads 8 -parse_deflines. The results in SAM format were visualized and manually investigated in integrative genomics viewer.31 Second, all Illumina sequencing reads of the genome of strain N85, which could be aligned to N85 genome, were mapped into the scaffolds of strain K7 and K11 through CLC Genomics Workbench version v8.0. The resulting unmapped reads were assembled again to detect the unique regions of N85 genome.2.8. Nucleotide sequence accession numberData from the whole-genome shotgun project have been deposited at the EMBL database under the accession number LN907784-LN907800.3. Results3.1. Genome sequencing and assembly of the N85 genomeGenomic DNA from S. cerevisiae strain N85 was sequenced using PacBio RS and Illumina HiSeq/MiSeq platforms. The average read length and coverage value from both sequencing platforms are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. De novo assembly of PacBio reads was performed using the RS HGAP24 assembly protocol version 3.3 in SMRT analysis version 2.2.0 (Pacific Biosciences) and resulted in 324 contigs (each with a length >500 bp, and an N50 value of 75,828 bp for all contigs). Subsequently, hybrid assembler PBcR35 and SPAdes22 were used to assemble the PacBio and Illumina reads together, and this generated 601 and 284 contigs, respectively. Additionally, we assembled the genome using only Illumina MiSeq and HiSeq reads with SPAdes, resulting in >1,000 contigs, and the N50 value was <10,000 bp when assembled with only paired-end MiSeq reads. The gap between contigs from each assembly method was further closed using SSPACE-LongReads.21 The assembly processes and results are summarized in Table 1 and Supplementary Fig. S2. Summary of the de novo hybrid assembly resultsaFor each assembly, only contigs >500 bp in length were considered.bHybrid represents the combination of HiSeq, MiSeq, and PacBio datasets.Summary of the de novo hybrid assembly resultsaFor each assembly, only contigs >500 bp in length were considered.bHybrid represents the combination of HiSeq, MiSeq, and PacBio datasets.De novo genome assemblies were further improved by combining the different hybrid assembly contigs and reference-guided assembly (see Section 2.3). Illumina reads were mapped to the S288c reference genome sequence using CLC genomic workbench to generate consensus sequences, which were used to place these contigs into 16 chromosomal and 1 mitochondrial sequences. The final assembly of the strain N85 genome showed high collinearity and structural conservation with that of the S288c reference (Fig. 1), excluding some repetitive or telomeric regions. Genome sequences that are derived from assembling reads potentially suffer from errors, especially around regions with repetitive sequences. Specifically, the ribosome DNA repeats in Chromosome XII appeared to be incorrectly assembled, and were manually adjusted based on the assembly of the closely related YHJ7 strain.15 Finally, the gapless and near-finished genome sequence of S. cerevisiae strain N85 was obtained, which contains 16 chromosomal and one mitochondrial sequences and is 12.09 million bp in total (Supplementary Table S2).

Multiple approaches used to annotate the N85 genomeIn order to achieve a high-quality gene annotation of the S. cerevisiae strain N85 genome, four different annotation approaches were performed. First, all ORFs in the model S. cerevisiae S288c were downloaded from the SGD and aligned to the N85 genome using exonerate.29 A total of 8,082 predicted ORFs were generated, and 6,236 of these were retained when the percentage coverage of the alignment cut-off was >50%. Second, ab initio gene prediction was performed with AUGUSTUS,25 which generated 6,786 draft predicted ORFs. Thirdly, the total reads from RNA-Seq experiments were mapped onto the genome of S. cerevisiae strain N85 using TOPHAT2 to generate exon and intron ‘hints’ in AUGUSTUS.25 With the help of these hints, local AUSGUSTUS genome prediction was carried out, resulting in 5,320 hints-based predicted ORFs. Lastly, total RNA-Seq reads were used to create the unbiased mapping-free transcriptome assembly using TRINITY,36 which generated 15,371 draft transcripts. The results of the final three methods were filtered by amino acid length (>100), and 6,405, 5,339, and 10,487 ORFs were retained, respectively.To compare coding differences between N85 and S288c, the amino acid sequences of the predicted ORFs were aligned to those of all S288c ORFs. 5,187, 4,968, and 5,267 S288c homologous genes were extracted from AUGUSTUS, AUGUSTUS-Tophat, and TRINITY predictions, respectively (Supplementary Table S3). Combining these S288c homologous genes and those from the exonerate prediction, 6,464 S288c homologous genes were identified in strain N85. Among them, 4,694 S288c homologous genes were present in all four predictions (Fig. 2A). Moreover, we identified 111, 86, and 82 non-S288c genes that were missing from the S288c genome annotation using AUGUSTUS, AUGUSTUS-Tophat, and TRINITY predictions, respectively (Supplementary Table S3). In total, 171 non-S288c genes were identified by merging all these non-S288c genes, and 17 non-S288c genes were common to all three predictions (Fig. 2B). Consistent with a previous study, we detected a large region (24 kb) in Chromosome XIV that includes three non-S288c genes (g5159, g5160, and g5161) that are only present in Asian yeast strains (Fig. 2C). In addition, we also detected some N85-specific regions that are not present in YHJ7, including the region in Chromosome XII that includes two novel genes g4241 and g4242 (Fig. 2C). The expression of these novel non-S288c genes was validated by RNA-Seq data, but their function requires further investigation. Annotation of the S. cerevisiae N85 genome.

Approximately, 20 million poly-adenylated RNA-Seq reads and 2 billion strand-specific ribosome-removed RNA-Seq reads were obtained, which allowed us to confirm the orientation of transcripts and predict anti-sense transcripts. After read mapping and transcript assembly, we classified all expressed transcripts longer than 200 nucleotides into coding genes and lncRNAs. Using these sequencing datasets, we detected 238 lncRNAs, most of which are novel lncRNAs not annotated in the databases (Fig. 3A). Consistent with previous studies, lncRNAs were expressed at significantly lower levels than coding genes (Fig. 3B, Wilcoxon test, P < 10-5). However, the function of these novel lncRNAs requires further investigation in the future. Besides lncRNAs, 619 transcript isoforms of N85 genes were also annotated using transcriptome analysis (Fig. 3A), and the expression levels of isoforms were slightly higher than those of genes without alternative splicing (Fig. 3B).

Genome variations in strain N85 compared with the model strain S288cTo examine genetic variation in N85, the Illumina short reads were mapped to the S288c reference genome, which identified 57,278 SNPs and 8,624 indels in N85 (Table 2). As expected, ~99% of these SNPs have been observed in the closely related YHJ7 strain. Although N85 is almost homozygous, 2,131 heterozygous sites were found in the diploid sequenced N85 strain (Table 2). The SNP distribution was not random, and approximately one-third of all detected SNPs were intergenic (Table 2), even though only about 25% of the S. cerevisiae genome is noncoding. More than 30% of SNPs detected in coding regions are nonsynonymous, resulting in changes to the encoded protein sequence. Interestingly, nonsynonymous mutations are more frequent in homozygous SNPs than in heterozygous SNPs (24 vs. 22%, respectively; P < 0.01, Chi-squared test). Moreover, several genes have gained or lost stop codons (Table 2). Genetic variations identified in the S. cerevisiae strain N85aHom: homozygous; Het: heterozygous. YHJ7-homologs represents those SNPs that shared with YHJ7 were filtered from the total N85 SNPs.Genetic variations identified in the S. cerevisiae strain N85aHom: homozygous; Het: heterozygous. YHJ7-homologs represents those SNPs that shared with YHJ7 were filtered from the total N85 SNPs.The nonsynonymous to synonymous substitution rate (Ka/Ks) relative to the S288c strain was assessed to identify fast-evolving genes. Genes with Ka/Ks values significantly >1 were classified as under positive selection. We identified 232 genes with Ka/Ks values > 1 (Supplementary Table S4). GO term analysis revealed that these genes were mostly associated with transcriptional control. Several stress-responsive transcription factors appear to have evolved rapidly in N85, including the GATA zinc finger protein GZF3, which regulates nitrogen catabolic gene expression, and two genes (HKR1, Ka/Ks = 1.94; MSB2, Ka/Ks = 1.22) involved in the HOG pathway, which have been shown to play a key role in the adaption of Chinese rice wine strains.37Sequencing of the N85 strain in its natural ploidy state allowed analysis of gross chromosomal rearrangements and aneuploidies. Based on the sequencing read depth, there were no gains or losses of whole chromosomes in the N85 genome (Supplementary Fig. S4), discounting polyploidy or aneuploidy. A total of 76 amplification and deletion events were detected in N85, covering 1.57 Mb of the genome (Fig. 4). The size of these regions ranges from 1 to 18 kb, and most were detected in subtelomeric regions. GO enrichment analysis of CNV regions revealed that genes involved in cellular responses to nitrogen starvation, asparagine metabolic processes, and cellular aldehyde metabolic processes are most heavily influenced by CNVs.

The genome differences between Chinese rice wine strain N85 and sake strainsIn general, the genome of Chinese rice wine strain is quite similar with those of sake strains after manually reviewing the BLASTn results between strain N85 and K7 as well as K11. However, some genomic variations may explain the differences between Chinese rice wine and sake to some content. Four hundred indels were identified in the genome of strain N85 compared with both sake yeasts K7 and K11. Among them, 116 indels were found in gene coding regions. Some affected genes were found to involve in the production of organic acids (KGD2, HSP31, BNA3), amino acids catabolism (STR2, HOM6, SPE2, CYS3, ARG2). Previous study suggested that strain with deficient a-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase (KGD2) produced fewer ethanol during wine brewing.38 The low ethanol content was compensated by an increase of organic acids, such citrate succinate, fumarate, and malate.38,BNA3 encodes a putative carbon-sulphur lyase responsible for volatile-thiol release. Deletion of BNA3 reduced the release of 4-mercapto-4-methylpentan-2-one, which makes an important contribution to the aroma of wine, in both laboratory and wine yeast background.39 Besides, the mutation of CYS3, which also encodes a putative carbon-sulphur lyase, led to over production of another sulphur compound, methyltetrathiophen-3-one, which was previously shown to contribute to wine aroma.39ARG2 locates in arginine biosynthesis pathway and encodes acetylglutamate synthase, which catalyses the first step in the biosynthesis of the arginine precursor, ornithine.In addition to indels, 25 regions in N85 genome were found to be absent either in the genome of strain K7 or that of K11, through mapping unmapped reads back to N85 genome. Five of these regions were identified to be absent in genomes of both sake strains. All of them are coding regions in the genome of strain N85, which encode the alpha-glucoside permease (MPH3), the sorbitol dehydrogenase (SOR1), a component of vacuolar cation channel (YVC1), and two putative proteins with unknown function (YGL262W and YGL263W). SOR1 and MPH3 locate on the subtelomeric paralogous blocks of Chromosome X. However, the effects of the gain or loss of these genes on Chinese rice wine and sake are still unclear.3.6. Genome browser for N85To visualize gene sequences, annotated genes, and genetic variants in the genome of S. cerevisiae strain N85, a JBrowse-based genome browser was developed and deposited on the website (http://www.ligene.cn/hygd (19 January 2018, date last accessed)). As shown in Fig. 5, the basic genome browser functionality can provide genome annotation views via an overhead bar that offers a visual indication of the chromosome position. Although only gene annotation and mutation information is currently available, further large-scale datasets will be integrated in the future. We also aim to implement additional analysis tools for BLAST searching, primer design, and sequence alignment, to help the scientific community to use the developed genome resources.

DiscussionChinese rice wine is a traditional fermented alcoholic beverage with many health benefits.40 Recently, the annual consumption of Chinese rice wine has been steadily increasing, and now is more than 2 million kilolitres.41,42 However, the complete genome sequence of the Chinese rice wine strain used for fermentation has not been reported, which makes it difficult to further improve the quality of this popular product. The purpose of the current study was to genetically characterize the S. cerevisiae strain N85 by sequencing the genome using both PacBio and Illumina platforms. Assembly was achieved by combining the long but relatively low-quality PacBio reads43 with the short but higher quality Illumina reads using a complex approach, and a high-quality genome of the N85 strain was generated. The assembled gapless and near-complete genome is equivalent in length to that of the model S288c strain. Due to the high integrity of the assembled genome, a larger number of protein coding genes were annotated through multiple annotation approaches compared with the gapped genome of the YHJ7 strain.15 This comprehensive annotation also identified additional non-S288c genes,15 which are important for functional and evolutionary analysis. Furthermore, the annotated genes in the N85-specific regions may be to explain the different evolutionary routes of Chinese rice wine strains.In addition, genome comparison between Chinese strain and Japanese strains revealed a series of variations in coding regions, which encodes genes involved in the production of organic acids and the catabolism of amino acids. These variations might explain the difference of flavour and nutritional value between Chinese rice wine and sake. Notably, some variants were identified in the coding sequence of ARG2, who encodes acetylglutamate synthase in arginine biosynthesis pathway. Arginine is the precursor of urea, which is considered to be the major precursor of EC. The mutation in ARG2 may lead to the higher concentration of EC in Chinese rice wine than that in sake. Besides, previous study revealed that two subtelomeric paralogous blocks in the genome of strain S288c, containing HXT15-SOR2-MPH2 on Chromosome IV and HXT16-SOR1-MPH3 on Chromosome X, were lost in the genome of strain K7.44 However, a part of the second block was identified in the genome of strain N85, containing SOR1-MPH3. These differences among the genome of laboratory, Chinese rice wine, and sake strains may suggest strains underwent different evolutionary tracks to cope with each environment.LncRNAs and alternative splicing are two important elements of transcription. LncRNAs are claimed to play an important role in the regulation of gene expression at transcriptional, post-transcriptional, and translational levels.45,46 Moreover, alternative splicing is a major contributor that determines the environmental fitness of an organism. Recently, various isoforms of the transcription factor GAT1 were discovered in S. cerevisiae that are involved in nitrogen catabolite repression regulation.47 In this work, numerous isoforms and novel lncRNAs were identified, enriching our existing knowledge in this area. Furthermore, future analysis of their functions could deepen our understanding of Chinese rice wine fermentation. It should be emphasized that current methods for annotating isoforms are not reliable; some annotated isoforms may be false-positives, and the accuracy of the results will be improved when the sequencing technology evolves and generates longer sequences.The presence of highly conserved SNP sites shared in the N85 and YHJ7 genomes but not in the S288c genome indicated that the two strains originated from a common ancestor that diverged from the ancestor of the model S288c strain, and underwent adaptation during Chinese rice wine fermentation. However, the enrichment of SNPs in intergenic regions in the N85 genome might be due to reduced functional constraints in intergenic sequences during the evolutionary history of this strain. The enrichment of nonsynonymous mutations in homozygous genes suggests the function of heterozygous genes is much more stable, and homozygous SNPs appear to make a greater contribution to functional adaption in the N85 strain. During the fermentation of Chinese rice wine, yeast suffer high concentrations of sugars resulting from the digestion of rice starches in the fermentation mash. The enrichment of nonsynonymous SNPs in the HOG pathway is indicative of adaptive evolution of the strain over its long history in Chinese rice wine fermentation. Notably, this phenomenon was also observed in the genome of another Chinese rice wine strain, namely YJH7.15 Similar enrichment was also identified in GZF3, one of four global transcriptional regulators of nitrogen catabolite repression, which may be responsible for the accumulation of EC in Chinese rice wine. Variations in genome structure, such as polyploidy, aneuploidy and copy number, have repeatedly been associated with domestication and adaptation to specific niches in experimentally evolved microbes.48 Moreover, due to their plastic and dynamic nature, loss or gain of genes in subtelomeric regions occurs more frequently than in other regions, which may accelerate adaptive evolution.49 Analysis of structural variation suggests that CNVs in the N85 genome may underlie niche adaptation.5. ConclusionWe combined sequencing data from Illumina and PacBio sequencing platforms to generate the first gapless and near-complete genome assembly of the S. cerevisiae strain N85 industrial strain used in Chinese rice wine brewing. Our study revealed many genes and genetic variations that may help the strain to cope with the high glucose and ethanol concentrations in the fermentation environment. Industrial rice wine producers, even other beverages producers, will likely benefit from having access to a complete N85 genome to improve their production progresses and products quality. In addition, our findings provide a rich genetic resource for the S. cerevisiae fundamental and applied research communities.FundingThis work was supported by The National Key Research and Development Programme of China (2017YFC1600403), the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31670095, 31770097), the Key Research and Development Programme of Jiangsu Province (BE2016689), the Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities (JUSRP51701A), the Six Talent Peaks Project in Jiangsu Province (2015-JY-005), the Distinguished Professor Project of Jiangsu Province, and a grant from Zhejiang Provincial Natural Science Foundation of China (LY14C060001) to Y.

IntroductionAdaptation to high altitude has contributed to the high level of plant and animal species biodiversity found on numerous mountains across the world.1 It is well known that animals (including humans) living in highlands have evolved unique genetic adaptations in order to maintain oxygen homeostasis.2 In plants, UV-B tolerance and cold tolerance appear to be critical for survival at high altitude.3 However, the genetic mechanisms by which immobile plants adapt to high-altitude conditions remain largely unknown due to a lack of appropriate genome resources.Species of the Brassicaceae family have a wide range of global distributions and adaptations, as well as different life histories and mating systems, and they therefore comprise an ideal system for many types of study.4,5 Genome resources are critically important for all these studies.6,7 Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technology have facilitated the ability of the scientific community to sequence the genomes of an increasing number of Brassicaceae species for multiple purposes.8–10 A previous genome study of an alpine polyploid Brassicaceae species suggested that expansion of numerous gene families was correlated with increased tolerance of cold and of UV-B stress.3 However, such expansions may have arisen purely from genome duplications rather than because of high-altitude adaptations.Eutrema is a genus in the Brassicaceae that contains more than 30 species, most of which are distributed in eastern Asia. In addition to the model plant E. salsugineum (Pall.) Al-Shehbaz & Warwick, which is used for studies of abiotic stress, and the commercial crop wasabi, E. japonicum (Miq.) Koidz, the genus contains numerous montane and/or alpine species.11 Most of these species occur in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau (QTP) and have originated recently in response to geologic and climatic changes since the Pliocene.12 In this study, we report the de novo genome sequence assembly and comparative genomic analysis of an alpine plant, E. heterophyllum, from the eastern QTP, and its lowland congener, E. yunnanense, both of which originated from a very recent common ancestor and are diploid perennials with chromosome numbers of 2n = 14 and similar selfing breeding systems,12 therefore providing an ideal basis for genetic comparisons without the complicating effects of either genome duplication or phylogenetic evolution. In addition, these two genome assemblies provide important genetic resources for future comparative studies of this genus and family and of high-altitude adaptation in alpine plants.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials, genomic DNA and total RNA extractionWe selected and sequenced a pair of Eutrema species that met three criteria: (1) diploid (2n = 14), (2) having diverged recently and (3) growing at contrasting altitudes in their natural distributions (Supplementary Fig. S1). One individual of E. heterophyllum was collected in June 2015 at the Zhuodala pass (~4,700 m above sea level; asl) in Ganzi County, Sichuan Province, China. Fresh and healthy leaves, flowers and root were harvested and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, followed by storage at -80 °C in the laboratory prior to DNA/RNA extraction. For comparison, fresh samples of leaf, leafstalk and root tissues were obtained from one E. yunnanense plant collected in April 2014, from Xinning County (~600 m asl), Hunan Province, China. We used the CTAB method to extract high-quality genomic DNA from 5 g of leaf tissues for each species. The quality of the high-molecular weight DNA was checked by 1% agarose gel electrophoresis. Around 200 µg of genomic DNA was used for library construction. We extracted total RNA with RNAiso Plus reagent (Takara, Japan) for each tissue collected from both species (i.e. leaves, flowers and roots for E. heterophyllum, and leaves, leafstalks and roots for E. yunnanense). The quality of the extracted RNA was verified by 1% agarose gel. DNase treatment was performed before library construction. For each sample, 5 µg of the total high-quality RNA was used for sequencing.2.2. Genome sequencing and assemblyWe constructed Illumina libraries with small (200-, 500- and 800-bp) and large (2-, 5-, 10- and 20-kb) inserts and then sequenced them following the Illumina protocols (Illumina, San Diego, CA) using the Illumina HiSeq X Ten platform at Novogene (Tianjin, China). Short reads were first subjected to quality filtering using Trimmomatic v0.33,13 error correction using BFC (version r181)14 and mate-pair data deduplication using FastUniq v1.1.15 We then used SOAPec v2.0116 to estimate the genome size as well as the level of genome-wide heterozygosity, which was based on the 17-mer frequency distribution. We adopted the Platanus17 pipeline, which can efficiently assemble genomes with various levels of heterozygosity. Both genomes were initially assembled into scaffolds using Platanus (version 1.2.2)17 with the first round of gap closing. An additional gap closing procedure was performed with GapCloser (version 1.12).16 Finally we evaluated genome assemblies for gene coverage using the CEGMA18 and BUSCO (version 2.0)19 pipeline.2.3. Repeat identificationTo structurally annotate repeat sequences in the two Eutrema genomes, we used the TEdenovo pipeline from the REPET package (v2.5) with default parameters.20 The pipeline performed a self-comparison for the input genome using the BLASTER software (version 2.25)21 to identify and classify repeated elements. In order to attain more comprehensive prediction of TEs, we employed the pipeline to carry out structural detection analysis using LTRharvest (version 1.5.8).22 RECON v1.0.8,23 PILER v1.024 and GROUPER v2.2721 were then employed to cluster the matches detected. By performing a multiple sequence alignment using the Map algorithm,25 a consensus sequence for each cluster was generated to represent the ancestral TE. These consensus sequences were then classified by looking for characteristic structural features and similarities to known TEs in Repbase (20.05),26 and by scanning against the Pfam library27 with HMMER3.28 To annotate all TEs across the genome, we further employed the TEannot pipeline21 with the default parameters. This pipeline mines the genome sequence using repeated sequences identified in the previous TEdenovo pipeline to produce classified non-redundant consensus repeat sequences along with short simple repeats, which are exported in GFF3 format. We followed the method of Maumus and Quesneville29 to calculate the age of repetitive DNAs.2.4. Gene predictionA combination of ab initio, homology-based and transcript-based methods was used for gene prediction. We first built a comprehensive transcriptome database with the PASA pipeline.30 After quality control with Trimmomatic v0.33,13 Illumina RNA-seq reads were assembled into de novo transcripts using Trinity.31 Then two sets of genome-guided transcripts were built using (1) the genome-guided mode implemented in Trinity and (2) the HISAT-StringTie pipeline.32 We performed ab initio prediction with Augustus (v3.2.2)33 using Arabidopsis thaliana as the species model and our comprehensive transcriptome dataset as the input cDNA hint. We used GlimmerHMM (v3.0.4)34 with the pre-trained directory for A. thaliana genes to generate another set of ab initio predictions. For homology-based prediction, protein sequences of 26,531 E. salsugineum genes35 as well as the UniRef90 dataset36 for all Brassicaceae species were aligned to the genome assemblies using SPALN2.37 Gene models from the three main sources (i.e. aligned transcripts, ab initio predictions and aligned proteins) were merged to produce consensus models by EVidenceModeler.30 Weights of evidences for gene models were manually set as: ab initio predictions, weight (Augustus) = 1 and weight (GlimmerHMM) = 1; protein alignments, weight (E. salsugineum) = 2 and weight (Brassicaceae_UniRef90) = 1; transcripts, weight (PASA) = 10. The EVM consensus predictions were updated by performing an additional round of PASA annotation in order to add UTR and alternatively spliced isoform annotations to gene models.2.5. Functional annotationWe used BlastP38 (with E-value = 1 × 10-5) to assign functional descriptions by carrying out sequence homology searches against different sources, including protein datasets from SwissProt39 and the Arabidopsis genome annotation version TAIR1040. Motifs and domains within gene models were identified by deploying InterProScan (version 5.20.29)41 with the options -dp -goterms -iprlookup -pathways -t p against multiple publicly available databases (Pfam, PROSITE, PRINTS, SMART, TIGRFAMs, Gene3D, PANTHER, etc.). We used AHRD (https://github.com/groupschoof/AHRD (24 January 2018, date last accessed)) to gather information from the search results and added Gene Ontology (GO) information using the GO annotation database42 for A. thaliana (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/GOA/arabidopsis_release; (24 January 2018, date last accessed)).2.6. Comparative genomic analysisWe downloaded the protein-coding genes of 13 Brassicaceae species (A. thaliana, A. lyrata, Brassica rapa, Capsella rubella, Leavenworthia alabamica, Sisymbrium irio, Aethionema arabicum, Arabis alpina, Raphanus raphanistrum, Cardamine hirsuta, Schrenkiella parvula, Thlaspi arvense, E. salsugineum; see Supplementary Table S4). We used OrthoMCL43 to delineate gene families and cluster all genes into paralogous and orthologous groups. Gene family expansion and contraction analysis was performed with CAFE3 software.44 Functional enrichment analysis was carried out by agriGO v2.0.45 We used R46 to perform clustering analysis for the gene families of the greatest size in E. heterophyllum. The transformed z-score profile was obtained from the number of genes per species for each family, and the hierarchically clustered (complete linkage clustering) ones, using Pearson correlation as a distance measure. The 2,235 single-copy gene families were used to reconstruct phylogenies with RAxML.47 Alignment of protein sequences was performed with PRANK48 and they were then back translated into coding sequences with PAL2NAL.49 The MCMCtree program within the PAML package v4.9a50 was used to estimate divergence time. The split of the two major lineages within the Brassicaceae was constrained to be between 20 and 30 million years ago.51 We used MCScanX52 to call intra- and inter-species gene collinearity. Synonymous substitutions were calculated for aligned gene pairs within identified collinearity blocks using the codeml program implemented in PAML.2.7. SNP calling and demographic history reconstructionWe used the pairwise sequentially Markovian coalescent (PSMC) model53 to estimate the history of effective population sizes (Ne) based on genome-wide diploid sequence data. This method has been previously applied to human and other vertebrates, as well as plants, for inferring demographic histories over long evolutionary periods. The quality-filtered Illumina pair end reads with insert sizes of ~500 bp for each species were mapped to the corresponding genome assemblies using BWA (version 0.7.10-r789).54 For SNP calling, we used the SAMtools (v1.4) pipeline.55 The settings for PSMC analysis (-p and -t options) were chosen manually according to suggestions given by the authors (https://github.com/lh3/psmc (24 January 2018, date last accessed)). We also performed 100 rounds of bootstrapping with the same parameters. The results were combined and plotted using the plot tool in PSMC. A generation time of 3 years and a mutation rate of 7 × 10-9 per site per year were applied.2.8. NLR genes and integrated domainsNLR (nucleotide-binding site with leucine-rich repeat) genes in the E. heterophyllum and E. yunnanense genomes were directly extracted from the InterProScan results using the Pfam domain of the nucleotide-binding adaptor shared by APAF-1, R proteins and CED-4 (NB-ARC, PF00931) as query. We further applied the same strategy to identify NLRs in protein sequences from 13 cruciferous species with genomes available. After excluding typical Pfam domains contained in NLRs (i.e. PF01582 for Toll/interleukin-1 receptor [TIR], PF13855 for leucine-rich repeat [LRR] and PF05659 for Resistance to Powdery Mildew 8 [RPW8]), we obtained a list of additional domains that were likely to be fused with NLR proteins. We did not detect TIR2 (PF13676) in our annotated NLRs; this is a TIR domain newly identified among NLR proteins.56 However, most previously characterized gene fusions were recaptured in this study, indicating that the approach we used for domain searching was conservative and generally reliable. A maximum likelihood tree of phloem protein 2 domains was constructed with RAxML under the PROTGAMMA model with BLOSUM62 matrix, specifying 500 bootstrap replicates. The gene tree was visualized in FigTree v1.4.2 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/ (24 January 2018, date last accessed)).2.9. Positive selection in SCC3 genesThe ratio of non-synonymous substitutions per non-synonymous site (dN) to synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS), or <U+03C9>, is a commonly used indicator of selective pressure acting on protein-coding genes, with <U+03C9> > 1 representing positive selection, <U+03C9> = 1 representing neutral evolution and <U+03C9> < 1 representing purifying selection. To identify signals of positive selection, we extracted SCC3 sequences from all Brassicaceae genomes. A gene tree of aligned protein sequences was constructed using RAxML under the PROTGAMMA model with BLOSUM62 matrix, specifying 500 bootstrap replicates. We used codeml in the PAML software package (v4.9a) to perform the branch-site test among duplicated SCC3 paralogs for a series of pairs of alternative versus null models, aiming to find out whether or not any proportion of coding sites within each paralog has <U+03C9> > 1 compared with the background level. Log-likelihood values for each pair of nested models were compared using the likelihood ratio test (LRT) to obtain the P-value of significance.3. Results3.1. Genome assembly and annotationAfter Illumina sequencing and quality control, we obtained 111.87 and 97.29 Gb of Illumina short reads from seven sequencing libraries, corresponding to an estimated 249× and 230× base-pair coverage, for E. heterophyllum and E. yunnanense, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). The estimated genome size of ~400 Mb for both species is larger than that of their congener E. salsugineum,35 with a higher level of genome-wide heterozygosity in the low-altitude species E. yunnanense (Supplementary Fig. S2). A de novo assembly pipeline allowed us to generate genome assemblies that captured 350 and 413 Mb in 149,415 and 317,771 contigs for the two Eutrema genomes, of which 328 and 386 Mb (81% and 91% of the estimated genome sizes) were represented in scaffolds of 1 kb or greater (Table 1). Repetitive DNA constitutes 67% and 70% of, respectively, the E. heterophyllum and the E. yunnanense genome. Long terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposons are the most abundant among these repetitive sequences (Supplementary Table S2), having contributed to a recent wave of TE burst (Kimura divergence = 5, Supplementary Fig. S3). Gene completeness analysis revealed that we had achieved more than 95% completeness of gene coverage for both genomes (Supplementary Table S3). We predicted 29,606 genes for E. heterophyllum and 28,881 for E. yunnanense (Table 1). Clustering of predicted proteomes for 15 Brassicaceae genomes yielded a total of 27,193 gene families, which comprised 380,484 genes (~85% of all 448,886 genes; see Supplementary Table S4). Genome assembly and annotation statistics for two Eutrema speciesGenome assembly and annotation statistics for two Eutrema species3.2. Comparative phylogenomics and demographic historiesWe analysed the phylogenetic relationships of 15 Brassicaceae species (Supplementary Table S4) using four-fold degenerate third-codon transversion (4DTv) sites in 2,193 one-to-one orthologous genes identified across their genomes. The nuclear-genome phylogeny (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S4) is congruent with the plastome phylogeny reported previously.51 We dated the divergence of the two species to 3.5 (1.5–7.2) Mya (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S5). Clustering analysis of gene family size revealed that many duplicated genes were retained in genomes known to be polyploid (Fig. 1). We failed to detect any additional whole genome duplication in the two Eutrema species when compared with A. thaliana using synonymous substitutions per synonymous site (dS) age distribution analysis (Supplementary Fig. S6). We identified 581,883 and 807,391 heterozygous sites in, respectively, the E. heterophyllum and the E. yunnanense genome. Consistent with the results of analysing K-mer frequency distribution (Supplementary Fig. S2), E. heterophyllum had a lower heterozygous SNP rate (1.75 × 10-3) than E. yunnanense (2.18 × 10-3). A sharp peak was observed in the distribution of genome-wide SNP density for E. heterophyllum (Fig. 2A), suggesting that mutations within this genome are more evenly distributed than those in the E. yunnanense genome. PSMC analysis based on the local SNP densities of heterozygous sites revealed distinct demographic histories for the two species, in that the high-altitude E. heterophyllum showed a decrease-increase-decrease trend while the population size of the low-altitude E. yunnanense decreased continuously in the recent past (Fig. 2B).

Red arrow denotes the estimated divergence time of the two species.3.3. Expansion of NLR genes and analysis of domain integrationIn comparison with other Brassicaceae species, we found that 141 and 178 gene families had significantly expanded (P < 0.05) in the E. heterophyllum and E. yunnanense genomes, respectively (Supplementary Tables S5–S8). Among the gene families that had expanded within the high-altitude E. heterophyllum, GO terms including ‘response to stress’ and ‘nucleotide binding’ (adjusted P < 0.05, Supplementary Fig. S7) were overrepresented, while no particular GO term was enriched in the case of the low-altitude E. yunnanense. The terms enriched in E. heterophyllum could be largely attributed to 10 clusters of disease resistance genes encoding nucleotide-binding site with leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins (Supplementary Table S6). We noticed that most of these NLR gene families had also expanded in the genomes of three other Brassicaceae species, A. alpina, A. lyrata and C. hirsuta, of which the former two are well documented as alpine plants (Fig. 3). Two NLR families shared across these species account for ~20% of the total number of NLR genes that differ between E. heterophyllum and E. yunnanense (Supplementary Table S5). Overall, the gene families expanded in E. heterophyllum overlap significantly with those expanded in each of these three species (P < 0.01, Fisher’s exact test) (Fig. 3; Supplementary Fig. S8). These results imply that parallel expansion of gene sets, particularly within the NLR genes, may have repeatedly occurred in alpine plants.

Numbers of significantly expanded gene families among the four genomes that contain the largest number of NLRs are shown. Counts of the significantly expanded NLR gene families are given in parentheses.Plant NLR genes can fuse with additional domains (hereafter referred to as NB-IDs) that serve as ‘baits’ for pathogen-derived molecules.56 We identified 112 NB-IDs with 82 distinct integrated domains across the Brassicaceae genomes (Supplementary Fig. S9; Supplementary Table S9). Within the fused domains, 22 were present in at least two genomes (Supplementary Table S10). Interestingly, in E. heterophyllum, we found that integration of one domain encoding phloem protein 2 (PP2, Pfam ID: PF14299), characteristic of a group of plant lectins involved in responses to various stresses,57 was shared by two other species, A. alpina and C. hirsuta (Fig. 4). It is worth noting that the NLRs fused with this domain were clustered into the same gene family that had undergone expansion in all these genomes (Supplementary Table S5). Obviously, the fusion of PP2 arose independently in these three species (Fig. 4), probably in response to the same class of pathogens.

See online version for color display.3.4. Species-specific gene duplications and high-altitude adaptationWe also analysed the functional enrichment of genes that were duplicated specifically in the high- or low-altitude species. In the high-altitude E. heterophyllum, we observed 30 enriched GO terms within the biological process ontology, including ‘response to stimulus’, ‘response to stress’, ‘reproductive process’ and ‘cell cycle’. However, only four terms within the biological process ontology, ‘developmental process’, ‘anatomical structure development’, ‘multicellular organism development’ and ‘multicellular organismal process’, were recovered for the low-altitude E. yunnanense (Supplementary Tables S11–S14).A close examination of the families expanded in E. heterophyllum revealed multiple genes that are involved in plant reproduction and DNA damage repair (DDR), probably in response to UV-B radiation and other abiotic stresses imposed by the harsh alpine environment. For example, more copies were found for NBS1, RPA32 and SNI1, which are involved in homologous recombination (HR) using the intact sister chromatid, and KU80 and XRCC4, which participate in the non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ) process (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Table S11); HR and NHEJ are the two major pathways for the repair of double-strand breaks.58 Duplicated genes involved in the regulation of the cell cycle (SIM, ATXR5 and ICK3) were also detected for E. heterophyllum (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Table S11); SIM is a plant-specific CDK inhibitor binding CDKB1; 1, probably specifically controlling endocycle onset during the G2/M transition.59Duplication of genes related to DDR in E. heterophyllum.

The expression profiles in FPKM (fragments per kilobase per million reads mapped) of paralogs are plotted as log10 values. See online version for color display.Of the genes with the largest family sizes (z-score normalized) in E. heterophyllum, two (SCC3 and SMC3) encode subunits of the cohesin complex, a well-known ring-shaped molecule with a critical role in sister chromatid cohesion.60 In E. heterophyllum, we found four copies of SCC3 and three ones of SMC3 (Fig. 5B). Most of these copies were expressed in leaf, root and/or flower tissue (Fig. 5B). A duplication of SCC3 was also found in A. lyrata, another alpine crucifer species (Fig. 6). Using the branch-site model, we showed that duplicated SCC3 copies were under positive selection (Fig. 6). The average pairwise identity between the amino acid sequences of the SCC3 genes in the high-altitude E. heterophyllum is only 61.1%, indicating that the duplication of this gene may have occurred very early. Intriguingly, although only one intact SCC3 gene was found in the low-altitude E. yunnanense, multiple SCC3 fragments were identified (Supplementary Fig. S10). Of these, one fragment was found within gene pairs that are collinear between the two Eutrema species (Supplementary Fig. S11). These findings suggest that duplication of SCC3 arose before the divergence of these species and subsequent pseudogenization may have occurred in E. yunnanense.

ICE2 encodes a transcription factor that confers rapid freezing tolerance in A. thaliana.61 The product of FAB1 is involved in membrane lipid synthesis and photosynthesis collapses in the Arabidopsis fab1 mutant due to degradation of chloroplasts when plants are exposed to low temperature for long periods.62,63,VIN3, which is induced by prolonged winter cold, is essential for the repression of FLC during vernalization.644. DiscussionIn this study, we performed de novo genome assemblies for E. heterophyllum and E. yunnanense, a pair of diploid perennials, which have diverged recently but have contrasting altitude preferences. Compared with previously published Brassicaceae genomes that were assembled from Illumina short reads,8,65 our genome assemblies were of high quality in terms of continuity and gene coverage, making them suitable for subsequent comparative genomic analysis and thus representing important genetic resources. Phylogenomic analysis confirmed the close relationship and the diploid nature of these two Eutrema species. However, the contrasting demographic histories of the two species may reflect their different responses to the local climatic oscillations that occurred during the Quaternary. The dramatic genomic differences observed here may have partly contributed to the high- or low-altitude adaptations that they exhibit.The NLRs are among the most variable genes across plant species. Variation in these genes between high- and low-altitude A. thaliana populations was discovered recently.66 We found an increase in the number of gene copies for some NLR groups in E. heterophyllum and other alpine species of the family Brassicaceae. In addition, we identified a fused domain encoding PP2 among these expanded NLR genes and confirmed the independent acquisition of this domain in different species. According to a recent comprehensive study of fused domains in plant species, this domain also exists in NLRs of Malvaceae and Poaceae species.56 Thus members of the PP2 family have fused with NLR genes multiple times in different angiosperm lineages. Further studies are needed to investigate whether and how plant immune receptors are involved in high-altitude adaptation in other alpine species.In the high-altitude E. heterophyllum, we found that many genes related to reproduction and DDR had undergone duplications, probably in response to abiotic stress. It should be noted that most of these reproduction-related genes remain as single copies in most angiosperms.67 In addition, two genes in this category (SCC3 and SMC3) that have undergone duplication events encode cohesin subunits, and similar copy number variations have also been found in animals, where they may cause distinct functional changes in the cohesin complex.68–71 To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of duplication and possible subfunctionalization of cohesin subunits in plants. We have further shown that duplications of SCC3 in Eutrema species occurred early, before their divergence. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that the apparent multiple partial SCC3 sequences identified in E. yunnanense may be due to the fragmented nature of the draft genome, the evidence for pseudogenization in this species is strong. The duplication, followed by subsequent loss, of SCC3 in E. yunnanense may be correlated with its initial occurrence (or its ancestral distribution) in the high-altitude QTP and subsequent migration to the lower-altitude region.12 As the cohesin complex has a profound impact on reproduction as well as on gene regulation, duplication of these subunits may have played an important role in plant adaptation to harsh alpine environments. In addition, duplication of genes related to cold acclimation in the high-altitude E. heterophyllum may be correlated with plant adaptation to the low and rapidly changing temperatures experienced in alpine habitats.In summary, we assembled de novo genomes of two Eutrema species and inferred genetic changes in the alpine species that may underlie high-altitude adaptation, although further tests in more species using multiple approaches are needed. The genome resources that we have developed for the two Eutrema species will be very useful for many studies in this genus, the Brassicaceae as a whole, and alpine plants in general.

IntroductionHigh-throughput genotyping platforms are essential tools for various genetic studies that involve genetic mapping, genome-wide association studies, phylogenetic analyses, marker-assisted selection (MAS) and genomic selection.1,2 Recent advances in sequencing technologies have greatly facilitated the discovery of polymorphisms in the whole genome. The 9K iSelect3 and 90K iSelect4 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays have been developed for allohexaploid wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) by transcriptome sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology. These arrays comprise many gene-based SNPs that allow an individual plant to be genotyped at all sites simultaneously and tend to be robust marker platforms. Therefore, these arrays have been widely used for germplasm characterization and quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping.5–12However, array-based markers are inflexible and have a relatively high per-sample cost. The number of polymorphisms detected by the markers on an array chip tends to substantially decrease in lines that are genetically distant from those used to design the array. When the 9K iSelect array, which was designed based on SNP information of American and Australian varieties, is used in Japanese varieties, a low polymorphic rate is detected, particularly in varieties grown in the southern regions (latitude 33–37°N).13 In this region, the wheat harvest season overlaps with the rainy season, and mainly domestic genetic resources have been used to breed varieties with resistance to pre-harvest sprouting and Fusarium head blight. On the other hand, in northern regions from Hokkaido (42–45°N) to Tohoku (37–41°N), there is less rain during the harvest season and several North American varieties were introduced to improve flour quality. In many cases, the polymorphisms detected in American and Australian varieties are not conserved in Japanese varieties. Furthermore, when Axiom HD wheat genotyping arrays (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA, USA) were used in Japanese materials, only 3.1% of the markers were categorized as ‘PolyHighResolution’, which defines markers with good cluster resolution and at least two examples of the minor allele (unpublished). However, a different set of markers in this array were of high quality and were more polymorphic in Japanese materials than in samples from varieties processed by the WISP (http://www.wheatisp.org/ (5 February 2018, date last accessed)) in the design of the array. Thus, the usefulness of array-based markers largely depends on the source of the polymorphisms. Additionally, genotype calls remain complicated because of the polyploid nature of wheat, and allele data should be interpreted with caution. These disadvantages are deleterious for MAS in wheat breeding programs because a cost-effective genotyping platform with a rapid turnaround time, low per-sample cost and very low rate of missing data is required for efficient MAS. Furthermore, MAS usually relies on a set of specific markers for specific QTLs and genes using a medium throughput system, rather than random genes or markers.Available array platforms are limited in their application to the D genome, because the genetic coverage of the D genome is highly inadequate.14 This tendency is also observed using other whole-genome genotyping platforms, such as DArT and genotyping by sequencing (GBS), which also have comparatively fewer D genome markers.15–17 Marcussen et al. reported that the origin of the D genome was 1–2 million years later than that of the A and B genomes.18 Furthermore, the D subgenome of hexaploid wheat was established by polyploidization ~0.4 million years later than the other subgenomes. The shorter time for accumulation of nucleotide polymorphisms induced by natural mutations might influence the scarcity of markers in the D genome. Therefore, to conduct studies focused on chromosomes in the D genome, new markers must be developed. However, the discovery of polymorphisms in wheat is hampered by its large genome size (16 Gb) and high repeat content (approximately 80%).19 Although the cost of sequencing is decreasing, sequencing the whole genome remains prohibitively expensive, particularly in species with large genomes. Henry et al.20 reported that exome capture combined with NGS can be used to successfully and efficiently detect Ethyl methanesulfonate-induced mutations. These authors compared the cost effectiveness among plant species with various genome sizes and concluded that this approach is increasingly advantageous as the genome size increases. Therefore, wheat is a suitable material for sequence capture in terms of cost effectiveness. Furthermore, this technique is useful in controlling the distribution of targets along chromosomes.Genotyping by multiplexing amplicon sequencing (GBMAS) (Lab protocols of Schnable Lab., Iowa State University: http://schnablelab.plantgenomics.iastate.edu/resources/protocols/ (5 February 2018, date last accessed)) and genome-tagged amplification (GTA)21 are new genotyping platforms that combine multiplexed PCR and multiplexed samples using bar codes with NGS. These methods appear to be suitable for MAS due to higher flexibility in choosing combinations of marker number and sample number. However, designing PCR primers for wheat is hindered by the close homology of the three genomes (A, B and D) and the high sequence similarity among the genes and gene family members. Recently, the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (IWGSC) offered a solution for distinguishing genomes using the chromosome-arm sorting technique.22 Using the differences among homoeologous sequences, genome-specific primers that span target polymorphic sites can be designed. Genotyping by amplicon sequencing using genome-specific amplicons could be highly beneficial for simplifying genotype calls and achieving robust analysis for MAS.The objective of this study is to develop an efficient approach for locating polymorphisms across the wheat genomes using the advantages of a sequence capture technique. To evaluate this approach, we designed D genome-specific primers and constructed linkage maps using multi-sample genotyping by amplicon sequencing.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and DNA extractionGenomic DNA was extracted from leaves of Triticum aestivum cv. ‘Kitahonami’ and cv. ‘Hatsumochi’ using a DNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). ‘Kitahonami’ is a winter wheat variety adapted to Hokkaido and has superior properties, such as high yield, high flour yield and high noodle-making quality. In contrast, ‘Hatsumochi’ was the first registered waxy (glutinous) variety and is adapted to the Kanto region (Central Japan). Diversity analyses indicated that modern Japanese varieties were separated into three groups corresponding to adaptation regions, and these two varieties fall into separate groups13,17; thus, we expected to observe a reasonable level of polymorphism between them. To construct the genetic map, a population of 94 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was developed by crossing ‘Hatsumochi’ and ‘Kitahonami’ then using the single-seed descent method to advance to the F9 generation. The total genomic DNA was extracted from the leaves of the RILs using the automated DNA extracting machine PI-50a (Kurabo Industries Ltd., Osaka, Japan).2.2. Capture probe design and preparation of librariesA workflow of sequence capture, polymorphism detection and designing genome-specific primers is described in Fig. 1. To design the capture probes, we selected 8,892 wheat expressed sequence tag (EST) and full-length cDNA sequences from NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ (5 February 2018, date last accessed)) and TriFLDB23 (Supplementary Table S1). Of these, 4,895 EST sequences were selected earlier during our design of PCR-based Landmark Unique Gene (PLUG) markers24 and were known to be evenly distributed across the wheat chromosomes. Most of the remaining 3,997 sequences were EST sequences derived from mapped 9K iSelect probes3 showing polymorphisms in Japanese varieties, and additional sequences to fill in gaps in coverage were based on bin-mapped wheat ESTs25 that were selected based on the barley physical map.26 Using the syntenic relationships among rice, barley and wheat, the selected sequences were estimated to be evenly distributed across the seven Triticeae chromosomes (Supplementary Table S1). All sequences were compared with one another, and only one representative homoeologous copy of each gene was selected for probe design. DNA capture of genomic DNA of ‘Hatsumochi’ and ‘Kitahonami’ was performed with a SeqCap EZ Developer Kit (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) following the manufacturer’s protocol.

HTM; Hatsumochi, KH: Kitahonami, SurvSeq: IWGSC survey sequence.22In total, 1,000 ng of each DNA sample was sheared using a Covaris LE220 (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA, USA) focused ultrasonicator to fragments that averaged 600 bp. An NEBNext Quick DNA Library Prep Master Mix set for 454 (New England Biolabs Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) was used to construct two genomic libraries. These libraries were amplified and fractionated from 500 to 700 bp before hybridization using a SeqCap EZ reagent Kit. To avoid hybridization with repetitive regions in the wheat genome, 1,500 ng of each amplified genomic library was mixed with 10 µL of SeqCap EZ reagent Kit in the presence of 10 µg PCE (plant capture enhancer, Roche Diagnostics) in a 0.2-mL thin-wall tube.2.3. Detection of nucleotide polymorphisms between ‘Hatsumochi’ and ‘Kitahonami’The enriched genomic DNAs were sequenced using the next-generation sequencer GS FLX plus (Roche Diagnostics). Reads were mapped to the wheat survey sequences22 using 454 Sequencing System Software 2.7 (option: -mi 98). The detected polymorphisms against the survey sequences, including SNPs and Indels, were supported with at least three reads in each variety. From them, polymorphic sites between ‘Hatsumochi’ and ‘Kitahonami’ were extracted. The predicted effects of the polymorphisms were analysed using SnpEff27 with IWGSC ver. 2.2 annotation data (https://wheat-urgi.versailles.inra.fr/Seq-Repository/Genes-annotations (5 February 2018, date last accessed)).2.4. Design of genome-specific primersThe flanking sequences of target polymorphism sites were obtained and blasted against the IWGSC survey sequences using PSI-BLAST,28 and three homoeologous sequences in terms of their chromosomal locations were identified. The three sequences were aligned by MAFFT ver. 6.86429 with a default parameters and imported into an in-house Java pipeline. This pipeline requires an alignment file of the homoeologous sequences in a target region. Based on the polymorphisms among the genomes, the pipeline automatically detects genome-specific primer pairs of 18–22 nucleotides at an amplicon length of approximately 300 bp. The primers contained nucleotides specific to the target sequence at the first and/or second positions from their 3' end. The forward and reverse primers for the first PCR were tailed with the common sequence tags CS1 (5'-ACACTGACGACATGGTTCTACA-3') and CS2 (5'-TACGGTAGCAGAGACTTGGTCT-3'), respectively, to allow for the addition of adapters during the second round of PCR according to the protocol of the Access Array for Ion Torrent PGM Sequencing System (Fluidigm Corporation, San Francisco, CA, USA).2.5. Library preparation and amplicon sequencingThe reaction mix for the first PCR contained a total volume of 10 µL consisting of 1× Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Qiagen), a primer mix (described below) and 20–50 ng of template DNA. The primer mix contained 48 sets of randomly selected locus-specific primers, with CS1 or CS2 tails attached. The first PCR program consisted of a denaturation step at 95 °C for 15 min, followed by 32 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 90 s at 60 °C and 1 min at 72 °C, and a final extension for 10 min at 72 °C. The product from the first PCR of each sample was diluted 100-fold with sterilized distilled water, and 2 µL of the diluted product was used as the template for the second PCR. To perform bidirectional amplicon tagging in the second PCR, a forward fusion primer containing Ion A adapter, barcode, and the CS1 sequence and a reverse fusion primer containing Ion P1 adapter and the CS2 sequence were used with a portion of the template, while a second portion was amplified with an A-adaptor–barcode–CS2 and P1 adaptor–CS1 primer combination.The 10-µL second PCR mix contained 1× Multiplex PCR Master Mix (Qiagen) and 400 nm forward and reverse fusion primers, and PCR was run using the following profile: 15 min at 95 °C, followed by 15 cycles of 30 s at 94 °C, 90 s at 60 °C and 1 min at 72 °C, and a final extension step of 10 min at 72 °C. All second PCR products were mixed in equivalent volumes (2 µL of PCR product per sample). The pooled product was purified using Agencourt AMPure XP Reagent beads (Beckman-Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) as follows: 12 µL of pooled products, 24 µL of TE buffer and 36 µL of well-mixed AMPure XP beads were vortexed. After a 10-min incubation at room temperature, the sample was placed onto a magnetic separator for 1 min, and the supernatant was discarded. The beads with sample attached were washed twice with 180 µL of freshly prepared 70% ethanol. Finally, the purified PCR products were suspended in 40 µL of low TE buffer. The quality of the amplicon library was assessed using an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, and a high sensitivity kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) was used to define the region covering all PCR library peaks (300–450 bp). The purified library was quantified using a Qubit dsDNA HS assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), with dilution to a concentration of 5 pM. Sequencing was performed using an Ion Torrent PGM system with an Ion PGM 400 sequencing kit and 318 chips (Thermo Fisher Scientific). A schematic diagram of the experimental procedure is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1.2.6. Data processing and genotype callingThe removal of the Ion Torrent sequencing adaptor sites and demultiplexing of the barcodes to separate the different samples were automatically performed by Torrent Suite ver. 5 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Further analysis was conducted using a custom Java script. First, the CS1 and CS2 tail sequences were removed. Second, the sequences were aligned to reference sequences using a BLAST-like alignment tool. The reference sequences consisted of internal sequences in the primers of each marker. Third, based on the alignment results of each sample-marker combination, the total number of aligned reads containing A, C, G and T bases, null alleles or missing values (NaN) and nucleotide deletions (“–”) in the base position of interest were counted. Fourth, the alleles were defined according to the bases with the highest read counts. The minimum read count was set to 5. Heterozygous site (H) was called when two alleles each had more than 40% of the total reads. Finally, the results of the genotype calls were summarized and exported into a tabular form.2.7. Construction of the linkage mapThe wheat PstI (TaqI) v.3 DArT array (Diversity Array Technology Pty Ltd., Bruce, Australia) and 9K SNP array3 were used to genotype 94 RILs. Publicly available SSR markers (GrainGenes 2.0) and functional markers30 of the Wx-A1, Wx-D1 and Pina-D1 genes were also used. The data obtained using DArT, 9K, SSR and the newly developed markers (TARC) were merged, and polymorphic markers between parents were extracted. Poor-quality genotypes and genotypes with more than 10% missing data or segregation distortion were removed. Because redundant markers are completely correlated or identical and cannot provide additional information, only one of a redundant set of markers was used in map construction. MapDisto 1.7.531 was used to identify linkage groups. Mapped markers corresponding to those on the hexaploid wheat consensus map3,15,32 were used as anchors to assign each linkage group to a particular chromosome and to orient linkage groups on short and long chromosome arms.2.8. Polymorphism survey using multiple genotypesTo increase the resources for nucleotide polymorphism detection, four additional varieties, namely ‘Shunyou’, ‘Tohoku224’, ‘Kinuhime’ and ‘Yumechikara’, were subjected to capture sequencing. The first three varieties are adopted to the Kanto and Tohoku regions (Central and Northeastern Japan), while the ‘Yumechikara’ variety is adopted to the Hokkaido region. The procedures used for DNA extraction, library preparation, sequencing by GS FLX plus (Roche Diagnostics) and mapping to the reference sequences22 were identical to those described above. To identify highly polymorphic sites, we performed pair-wise comparisons among the six varieties used. The detected polymorphisms, including SNPs and Indels, were supported with at least one read as either “Reference” or “SNP” in a given variety. If reads supported both “Reference” and “SNP”, we identified that variety as heterozygous at that site.3. Results3.1. Detection of polymorphisms between ‘Hatsumochi’ and ‘Kitahonami’Using the next-generation sequencer GS FLX plus, 1,114,867 (536,055,413 bp) and 1,304,168 (615,634,987 bp) reads were obtained from the enriched genomic DNA of ‘Hatsumochi’ and ‘Kitahonami’, respectively. The average lengths of the sequences were 481 bp for ‘Hatsumochi’ and 472 bp for ‘Kitahonami’. Based on the criteria described above, 12,551 nucleotide polymorphisms were detected between these two varieties (Supplementary Table S2). Using the survey sequences,22 we localized these polymorphisms to each chromosome or chromosome arm. As shown in Table 1, the number of polymorphisms varied among the chromosomes and genomes. The number of polymorphisms on the D genome were approximately one-sixth and one-fifth of those on the B and A genomes, respectively. Relatively fewer polymorphisms were observed in the Group 4 chromosomes than in the other groups. The cumulative numbers of polymorphic sites according to the gene models are shown in Fig. 2. Most polymorphisms were found in genic regions, including both the 500-bp upstream and downstream regions (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table S2). In the intron regions, 5,220 polymorphisms were detected, meaning the intron regions carried the highest percentage (41.6%) of the total polymorphisms.

Validation of polymorphisms by amplicon sequencingThree hundred and ninety-six D genome-specific primers were designed using the primer-picking pipeline described above. The details regarding the primers are provided in Supplementary Table S3. Preliminary analysis of primers using gel electrophoresis of PCR products indicated that single PCR products with the expected fragment sizes were obtained using 380 of the 396 primer sets. Multiple products or a lack of bands were observed using the remaining primer sets. The PCR products from the 380 successful primer sets were mixed and sequenced using GS FLX plus. In total, 442,564 (average length 322.7 bp) and 640,147 (average length 327.2 bp) reads were obtained from the amplicons of ‘Hatsumochi’ and ‘Kitahonami’, respectively. The sequences derived from 312 markers were mapped to reference sequences without interference from off-target or homoeologous sequences (Table 2). Mixtures of homoeologous sequences were observed using 44 markers, which were classified according to the degree of the mixture as follows: low (<30%), medium (30–50%) and high (>50%). The alleles in markers with a low level of mixture could automatically be defined; in contrast, manual examination of the data was required to define alleles in markers with medium and high levels of mixture. The polymorphisms detected with 334 of the markers were consistent with those obtained using sequence capture (Supplementary Table S3). Thirty-six markers failed to validate the polymorphisms because of mixtures of homoeologous sequences, while 17 markers showed low read coverage. Nine markers did not show polymorphisms at the target sites.

Genotyping by amplicon sequencing in 96 multiplexed samplesThe ‘Hatsumochi’/‘Kitahonami’ RILs were genotyped using an Ion PGM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) according to the procedure described above. The variations in the number of reads per sample and per maker are shown in Fig. 3. The number of reads per sample was relatively stable, and the average read count was 34,873. However, the variation in the number of reads per marker was high. The difference between the most and least sequenced markers was more than 150-fold. The markers with large product sizes tended to show a low number of reads (data not shown). Based on mapping to the reference sequences, we classified markers into eight classes (Table 2). The alleles in markers in classes 1–3 could automatically be defined, while those in markers in classes 4–6 had to be defined manually. Class 7 indicates markers with mixtures of sequences and indels, and class 8 represents no or quite low reads. The genotypes of 96 samples using 359 markers were obtained, and missing values accounted for only 1.2% (392 of 33,746 data points). Variations in the number of reads per sample (a) and per marker (b).

Error bars in the lower figure indicate standard deviations among 96 samples.3.4. Extension of D genome maps using the newly developed markersBy combining the data obtained using the newly developed markers (defined as TARC markers) with those obtained using DArT, 9K array and SSR, genotyping data for 3,956 markers was obtained (Supplementary Table S4). According to the grouping of redundant markers, 1,408 markers were considered non-redundant and were used for map construction using MapDisto software.31 After filtering by redundancy, the number of DArT and 9K markers was reduced to 42.9% and 25.9% of the initial number, respectively. In contrast, of the 359 TARC markers, 261 (72.7%) remained after filtering. Using the default settings of MapDisto, 32 linkage groups were extracted from the 1,399 markers. Nine markers were unassigned. Three linkage groups were not assigned to chromosomes because of the lack of sequence information for the markers. The linkage map covered 3,994.7 cM, with an average chromosome length of 189.6 cM, and the lengths of the individual chromosomes varied from 95.3 cM (6D) to 275.4 cM (3B). Chromosomes 1A, 2A, 3A, 5D, 7B and 7D consisted of two linkage groups, and chromosome 6D consisted of three linkage groups. Only maps of the D genome are illustrated in Fig. 4. The complete set of linkage maps is shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. The number of loci per chromosome varied from 29 (4D) to 112 (2B), with an average of 66 loci per chromosome. Using a maximum of 0.61 for chromosome 1A and a minimum of 0.21 for chromosome 4D, the overall marker density was 0.36 markers per cM. The D genome linkage maps were compared with previous maps without the TARC markers. The total length of the D genome increased from 878.4 cM to 1333.1 cM, and the average distance between markers changed from 1.45 to 2.09 cM. In comparison, the A genome map length was 1222.7 cM with 2.58 cM between markers on average and the B genome 1425.4 cM with 2.80 cM between markers. The TARC markers were distributed across the seven wheat chromosomes and significantly filled the previously observed gaps (Fig. 4). Furthermore, the TARC markers successfully extended the long arms of 1D, 2D, 4D and 6D and the short arms of 2D and 4D. Linkage maps of the D genome using the ‘Hatsumochi’/‘Kitahonami’ RILs.

Detection of polymorphisms among the six varietiesUsing the GS FLX plus, 8,253,381 reads were obtained from the six varieties. Of these reads, 5,473,010 reads were uniquely aligned to the IWGSC survey sequences.22 Using the criteria described above, 31,542 polymorphic site candidates were detected (Supplementary Table S5). The pair-wise comparisons among the six varieties are shown in Table 3. The number of polymorphisms among the varieties ranged from 9,491 (‘Tohoku224’ vs. ‘Kinuhime’) to 19,926 (‘Hatsumochi’ vs. ‘Yumechikara’) and averaged 15,498 sites. Based on the mapping of the results to the IWGSC survey sequences, 5,986 polymorphic sites were predicted to be on the D genome and, therefore, can be considered potential markers for the D genome (Supplementary Table S5).

DiscussionIn allohexaploid wheat, marker development is hampered by a large genome size, a high proportion of highly repetitive sequence (>80%), and the presence of three different genomes in which corresponding genes share a high level of sequence similarity. Because of these characteristics of the wheat genome, nucleotide polymorphisms have been obtained primarily using transcript sequences33,34 or restriction-site flanking sequences.16,17 Although these methods have greatly contributed to increasing the number of markers, they do not provide a method of controlling the chromosomal locations of the detected polymorphisms. Therefore, although the number of polymorphisms is high, a significant bias occurs in the distribution of polymorphisms across the genome. Thus, targeted development of markers is required to saturate linkage maps. In this study, gene-enriched libraries were prepared using custom capture probes. To design the probes, we used positional information from sources such as the consensus linkage map (International Triticeae Mapping Initiative, ITMI),32 bin-mapped ESTs,25 PLUG markers35 and the barley physical map.26 Through this process, the map length in the D genome increased dramatically from 878.4 cM to 1333.1 cM (Fig. 4), and we were able to successfully develop markers in regions that were not covered by commercially available marker platforms, including DArT and 9K arrays. Because of the large genome size of wheat (16 Gb), the extraction of reliable polymorphic sites supported by sufficient read depth was believed to require a high-performance sequencer. However, in this study, using the GS FLX plus (Roche diagnostics), we obtained only 536 and 616 Mb sequences from the genomic DNA of ‘Hatsumochi’ and ‘Kitahonami’, respectively, indicating that less than 4% of the genome was sequenced in each variety. Despite this low coverage, we detected 12,551 polymorphic sites with an average read depth of 5.4 and 5.9 in ‘Hatsumochi’ and ‘Kitahonami’, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). These observations indicated that the SeqCap EZ reagent kit (Roche Diagnostics) enriched the target sites by approximately 160-fold compared with whole genome analysis and greatly contributed to the effectiveness of polymorphism detection. In reference to the gene models of the IWGSC survey sequences,22 most polymorphic sites were located near genes, indicating that we successfully eliminated repetitive sequences and effectively enriched the targets. The elimination of repetitive elements is important for genome mapping because these elements usually distort the mapping results. In this study, more than 40% of the polymorphic sites were in intron regions, and thus could not be found using transcriptome analyses. Because intron regions have a higher level of polymorphisms than exon regions, enriched genomic sequencing is a beneficial approach for developing gene-related markers. Furthermore, based on SnpEff analysis,27 60 and 1,630 polymorphisms were predicted to have high and moderate effects on the corresponding gene functions, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). Therefore, the strategy used in this study effectively identified polymorphisms that could potentially be related to agronomically important traits.In allohexaploid wheat, the presence of three homoeologous genomes poses a challenge in SNP detection. Although a difference in degree is observed, many markers on the commercially available SNP arrays are affected by interference from the other two homoeologous sequences.36 In this study, the genome-specific primers were highly beneficial for defining alleles. Approximately 80% of the marker loci were successfully genotyped using the locus-specific approach when we validated the polymorphisms using the two parental varieties (Table 2). When we used the RIL populations, more than 70% of the markers were grouped into classes 1–3, indicating that these markers could be genotyped similarly to diploid species. Based on these results, our strategy of designing genome-specific primers was effective and demonstrated the importance of obtaining a priori knowledge of the polymorphisms among genomes by comparing the homoeologous sequences of interest.The variations in the read number among samples and markers were investigated (Fig. 3). In this study, we did not equilibrate the multiplex PCR samples from individual wells before mixing samples. Despite this simplification of the process, the read numbers among the samples were relatively uniform, except for one outlier sample that had an extremely low number of reads. Therefore, the protocol used in this study is beneficial for processing many samples. In contrast, the read numbers varied among the markers, with the read number ranging from nearly zero to more than 200 per sample. Markers with longer amplicons tended to have fewer reads (data not shown); however, other factors, such as the annealing efficiencies of the primers, also affected the read numbers. Because the multiplex levels of the samples and markers were determined according to the minimum number of reads required for each marker, a uniform distribution of read numbers among the markers is important. Further optimization of the multiplex PCR conditions will be beneficial in minimizing missing genotype values.Because amplicon sequencing primers are typically designed to flank the site of interest, other polymorphisms in addition to the site of interest can sometimes be identified. When applying the method described in this paper to breeding or genetic analysis, the detection of new polymorphisms that are independent of the target sites could provide additional haplotype information for the samples of interest, and such haplotype information substantially improves power in the detection of marker-trait associations.37 Informative markers that contain more than two polymorphic sites could reduce the marker number required for an investigation, thereby reducing the cost for genotyping, and help in performing various genetic studies, such as association mapping and genomic selection in breeding programs.Because the existing SNP arrays are substantially deficient in the number of D genome markers, we developed markers for the D genome to demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach. The polymorphism rate of the D genome is lower than that of the other two genomes, which is attributed to the evolutionary history of the D genome. According to recent studies, interploidy natural hybridization and subsequent introgression played a significant role in the diversification of common wheat,38 and therefore, the D genome had fewer opportunities to exchange genetic material than the A and B genomes. Although the polymorphic rate is low, comparable numbers of important genes and QTLs on the D genome are described in the catalog of gene symbols for wheat.39 Recent genome-wide association studies for pre-harvest sprouting using Chinese wheat landraces40 and European winter wheats41 reported QTLs on 1D, 3D and 5D chromosomes. Additionally, resistant genes against wheat yellow mosaic virus and soil-borne wheat mosaic virus were found on chromosomes 2D and 5D, respectively.6,42 For the fine mapping of these agronomically important genes or QTLs, the number of markers must be increased around the regions of interest. From the polymorphism survey using six varieties, around 6,000 polymorphic sites were detected on the D genome, and some sites have been successfully used to develop markers (data not shown). Therefore, the polymorphic information obtained in this study is a useful resource for the further development of markers across the genome.In this study, we proposed efficient strategies for the detection of nucleotide polymorphisms among varieties of interest and the design of locus-specific primers to achieve robust high-throughput genotyping. The IWGSC’s continuous effort to obtain the first reference sequence of the spring wheat variety ‘Chinese Spring’ is opening the post-genomic era (http://www.wheatgenome.org/ (5 February 2018, date last accessed)). In this era, the motivation for collecting genomic resources using in-house materials is likely to increase. By comparing the polymorphic sites found in this study with probe sequences in publicly available SNP arrays, at least two-thirds of the total sites did not show any similarity with those probes in BLASTn searches (Supplementary Tables S2 and S5). The high percentage of new polymorphic sites indicates the importance of polymorphism surveys using materials of interest. In addition to the number of polymorphic sites, the polymorphic frequencies among materials are also important. Compared with the existing SNP arrays, the polymorphic sites among the six varieties in this study provided highly polymorphic markers among Japanese materials, particularly among varieties from Central and Western Japan (data not shown). To date, the germplasm used in genomic studies has been limited to the leading varieties in developed countries. However, for specific traits, such as resistance to disease or abiotic stress, many sources of germplasm from around the world remain unexamined. Because the method described in this study is less expensive, more flexible and more reliable than previous methods, this method is suitable for pan-genome studies that must process many haplotypes.Data AvailabilityAll sequences analysed in the present study were deposited into the DDBJ/GenBank/MMBL database with accession numbers DRA006270.

IntroductionPlant genomes have experienced more gene duplication events than most other eukaryotes.1 These duplications are largely classified into whole genome duplications (WGDs) and small-scale duplications (SSDs). WGD events are concentrated in the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction period.2 SSDs such as retroduplication and tandem duplication have occurred continuously at a high rate during plant evolution, indicating that SSDs may be a key factor for plant speciation or phenotypic differences in close relatives.3–8 SSDs tend to be lineage-specific in land plants.4 There is a clear functional bias between WGD and SSD in plants.4,9 SSDs tend to be associated with stress responses,4,8–10 and are likely important for adaptive evolution to rapidly changing environments in close relatives.SSD genes functionally diverge through either neo-functionalization or sub-functionalization, which may contribute to speciation.11,12 SSD genes can also retain functional redundancy through the long-term fate of becoming pseudogenes,13,14 dosage selection15,16 or avoiding developmental errors.17–19 Functional divergence of duplicated genes can be inferred by selection pressures based on the non-synonymous substitution rate (KA) versus the synonymous substitution rate (KS). Genes undergoing positive selection (KA/KS > 1) and purifying selection (KA/KS < 1) are associated with functional divergence and constraint, respectively.20 Most earlier studies compared selection pressures in WGDs with those in SSDs, or selection pressures in anciently duplicated genes (several hundred million years [MY] ago) in plants.21–24 There are little data with which to examine selection pressures in recent SSDs in plants. Because selection pressure likely varies during the speciation process, it is important to examine the selection pressures immediately after gene duplications among close relatives.Recently, there are many plant genomes assembled by Illumina DNA-sequencing reads.25 However, SSDs tend to be underestimated in contigs generated by only Illumina DNA-sequencing.26,27 It is likely that genomes generated by BAC are useful to examine SSDs. However, construction of such a library takes much budget and time to generate highly qualified genomes. In the present study, we tried to generate reliable orthologous genes by only paired-end Illumina DNA-sequencing reads using available genomes of close relatives. We then inferred SSDs in a species after the divergence of closed species throughout the reading depth of Illumina DNA sequencing.The Arabidopsis lineage seems to be the best lineage to examine recent SSDs in plants because Arabidopsis has two BAC library-based genomes in Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis lyrata.28,29 In particular, A. thaliana has a large amount of functional data for its annotated genes. To comprehensively examine SSDs in Arabidopsis, we investigated an additional Arabidopsis species—A. halleri. The divergence time between A. lyrata and A. halleri is supposed to be ~2 MYA,30 and the divergence time between either A. halleri or A. lyrata and A. thaliana is ~10–11 MYA.31 Among recently diverged three Arabidopsis species, there are phenotypic variations such as self-compatibility and heavy-metal tolerance. A. thaliana has self-compatibility, but the others are self-incompatible.32–34 Therefore, A. halleri and A. lyrata have large petals to attract pollinator insects, and the anthers are separated from the stigma to avoid autopollination.35,A. halleri is known as a Zn/Cd hyper-accumulator33,34 and some wild populations of A. lyrata are tolerant of serpentine soils, which are characterized by a high heavy-metal content,36 while A. thaliana is not.A. halleri has highly variable morphologies with respect to leaf, flower colour and development of stolons among the subspecies. To examine SSDs in the Arabidopsis lineage, we focused on A. halleri subsp. gemmifera which grows in the Russian Far East, northeastern China, Korea, Taiwan and Japan across lowland and highland areas. We collected the plants in Mt. Ibuki, Shiga, Japan. We then extracted the plant DNAs, and performed the paired-end Illumina DNA sequencing. After generating contigs from the Illumina DNA-sequencing reads, we inferred A. halleri orthologous genes against the A. thaliana and A. lyrata genes. The number of SSDs was inferred both from phylogenetic analysis of orthologous genes and the reading depth of Illumina DNA sequencing. As outgroup species for the three Arabidopsis species, we used five non-Arabidopsis species in Brassicaceae for which genome sequences are already determined. There is trans-specific polymorphism in Arabidopsis; in particular, some genes have undergone gene flow in Arabidopsis.37 Here, excluding genes that have undergone gene flow in Arabidopsis, we generated three sets of orthologous gene groups (OGGs) among five non-Arabidopsis species, A. thaliana, A. lyrata and A. halleri in Brassicaceae (Fig. 1). Each OGG represent genes derived from one ancestral gene in each speciation event. By identifying the genes in each OGG, we examined the evolutionary process in the Arabidopsis lineage. Although a BAC library-based genome for A. halleri is unavailable, there is an available A. halleri genome based on long-insert mate paired reads and short-insert paired-end reads in Illumina DNA sequencing.38,39 The available A. halleri genome was originated from A. halleri subsp. gemmifera which was the same subspecies in our plant material. The collection site was in Tada mine, Hyogo, Japan. Microsatellite analyses suggested that our plant material collected from Mt. Ibuki, Shiga, Japan was genetically closed to the plant with the available genome.40 Thus, it is likely that A. halleri genes inferred from the available genome are similar to our inferred A. halleri genes. To validate our overall results, we also examined SSDs based on the available A. halleri genome, Three sets of OGGs among non-Arabidopsis species, A. thaliana, A. lyrata and A. halleri. OGGs between A. lyrata and A. halleri were defined as AL–AH OGGs. There were 25,833, 26,428 and 26,007 AL–AH OGGs based on Illumina paired-end DNA-sequencing reads without any pseudogene-like genes, Illumina paired-end DNA-sequencing reads including pseudogene-like genes and the available A. halleri genome, respectively. OGGs among A. thaliana, A. lyrata and A. halleri were defined as AT–AL–AH OGGs. There were 22,105, 22,684 and 21,537 AT–AL–AH OGGs based on Illumina paired-end DNA-sequencing reads without any pseudogene-like genes, Illumina paired-end DNA-sequencing reads including pseudogene-like genes and the available A. halleri genome, respectively. OGGs among non-Arabidopsis species (B. rapa, B. stricta, C. grandiflora, C. rubella, E. salsugineum), A. thaliana, A. lyrata and A. halleri were defined as nonA-AT–AL–AH OGGs. There were 17,669 and 17,925 non-A-AT–AL–AH OGGs based on Illumina paired-end DNA-sequencing reads without any pseudogene-like genes and the available A. halleri genome, respectively.Three sets of OGGs among non-Arabidopsis species, A. thaliana, A. lyrata and A. halleri.

OGGs among non-Arabidopsis species (B. rapa, B. stricta, C. grandiflora, C. rubella, E. salsugineum), A. thaliana, A. lyrata and A. halleri were defined as nonA-AT–AL–AH OGGs. There were 17,669 and 17,925 non-A-AT–AL–AH OGGs based on Illumina paired-end DNA-sequencing reads without any pseudogene-like genes and the available A. halleri genome, respectively.In a previous report, selection pressures of genes duplicated after the divergence of A. thaliana and A. lyrata were examined in the A. thaliana lineage.23 These lineage-specific duplicated genes tend to have undergone positive selection. Here, we examined the selection pressures in duplicated genes in the other lineage after the split between A. thaliana and A. lyrata. This lineage was further split into the A. halleri–lyrata lineage and A. halleri lineage (Fig. 2). We then examined whether gene duplications in either the A. halleri–lyrata or A. halleri lineage contributed to functional divergence in the retained duplicate genes. Gain rates through gene duplication in land plants. The divergence times among moss (P. patens), rice (O. sativa), poplar (P. trichocarpa), B. rapa, A. thaliana, A. lyrata and A. halleri were taken from previous reports.30,31,72–75 Gene gains through gene duplication were estimated for each branch. The gene gains in two branches were estimated in this study. One was the A. halleri-lyrata lineage, which represents the evolutionary process of the A. halleri lineage between the divergence of A. thaliana and the divergence of A. lyrata. The other was the A. halleri lineage, which represents the evolutionary process of the A. halleri lineage after the divergence of A. lyrata. Gene gains were divided by ancestral gene numbers and branch lengths corresponding to times (MY). The rate of gene gain was defined as the number of genes gained through gene duplication per gene per MY.Gain rates through gene duplication in land plants.

Gene gains were divided by ancestral gene numbers and branch lengths corresponding to times (MY). The rate of gene gain was defined as the number of genes gained through gene duplication per gene per MY.Duplicated genes may have undergone purifying selection in the Arabidopsis lineage. The gene dosage hypothesis proposes that duplicate genes can be fixed for increased gene dosage, keeping redundant functions among duplicated genes. In A. halleri, the expression of HEAVY METAL ATPASE 4 (HMA4) has been enhanced by cis-regulatory mutations and increased gene copy number for metal hyperaccumulation.41 This is an example of increased gene dosage by gene duplication. Consequently, duplicated genes with purifying selection tend to be associated with increased gene dosage.To understand the contribution of duplicated genes to the speciation process in Arabidopsis within the last 10 MY, we first examined the frequency of gene duplications in the A. halleri–lyrata and A. halleri lineages. We then examined the relationship between gene duplication and selection pressure based on the KA/KS ratio. Finally, we examined the over-represented functional categories of genes under positive and purifying selection.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sampling and illumina paired-end DNA-sequencing analysisArabidopsis halleri subsp. gemmifera is one of the three subspecies of A. halleri, and grows in the Russian Far East, northeastern China, Korea, Taiwan and Japan.42 In 2008, a leaf sample was collected from an individual of A. halleri subsp. gemmifera on Mt. Ibuki, Shiga, Japan. DNA was extracted from the leaf using a DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Venlo, The Netherlands). A 300-bp paired-end DNA library was constructed according to the paired-End Genomic DNA Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA), and 93-bp paired-end reads were obtained from the Illumina GAIIx sequencer.A total of 44.5 Gb reads were generated by Illumina DNA paired-end sequencing. Using the Trim Galore (www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk) software, sequences with low-quality base calls (Phred score < 20) were trimmed off from the 3' end of the reads. Adapter sequences started with ‘AGATCGGAAGAGC’ were completely removed from the reads. Approximately 28% of reads had either low-quality scores or adapters and were trimmed by Trim Galore. When a paired-end read was completely removed by this procedure, the other read was used as a single-end read. Given that mitochondrial and chloroplast genomes have much higher copy numbers than the nuclear genome, sequencing reads mapped to either the mitochondrial or chloroplast genome in A. thaliana (https://www.arabidopsis.org, TAIR10) or A. lyrata (http://genome.jgi.doe.gov, FilteredModels6) by BLASTN version 2.2.29 (e-value < 1.0) were excluded from the following procedures.43 Assuming that the genome size of A. halleri was 255 Mb,44 the sequencing coverage was estimated to be ~135× (34.4/0.255 Gb).2.2. Gene sequences of Brassica rapa, Boechera stricta, Capsella grandiflora, Capsella rubella, Eutrema salsugineum, A. thaliana and A. lyrataGene sequences in B. rapa (BrapaFPsc_277_v1.3), B. stricta (Bstricta_278_v1.2), C. grandiflora (Cgrandiflora_266_v1.1), C. rubella (Crubella_183_v1.0) and E. salsugineum (Esalsugineum_173_v1.0) were collected from Phytozome (https://phytozome.jgi.doe.gov, version 10). Gene sequences in A. thaliana and A. lyrata were collected from TAIR (https://www.arabidopsis.org/, version 10, TAIR10_cds_20110103) and JGI (http://genome.jgi.doe.gov, FilteredModels6), respectively.2.3. Assembly of A. halleri genes orthologous to A. lyrata genes based on illumina paired-end DNA-sequencing readsWe first generated A. halleri contigs from a total of 44.5 Gb Illumina DNA-sequencing reads using several assembly software tools such as Platanus 1.2.4,45 ABySS 1.5.2,46 SOAP-denovo247 and CLC Genomics Workbench 7.0.3 (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/) software. A higher proportion of genes in closely related species tend to be mapped to reliable assembled sequences. As the closest species, 32,670 annotated A. lyrata genes were mapped to each type of assembled DNA segment by the gmap (version 2014-08-20) software with default parameters, which takes into account exon–intron junctions.48 The A. halleri contigs generated by the ABySS software with 63 K-mer size (N50 size = 5,331 bp) had the highest mapping rate to the 32,670 annotated A. lyrata genes with >80% coverage (Supplementary Table S1). Some of the matched regions were truncated by terminal codons. When coding sequences up to the terminal codon had >80% similarity to and 80% coverage for an A. lyrata gene, the coding sequence was defined as the orthologous A. halleri gene sequence to an A. lyrata gene. Following this procedure, we generated 22,727 orthologous gene pairs between A. halleri and A. lyrata. However, an A. lyrata gene sequence was frequently mapped to different A. halleri contigs depending on the region of the A. lyrata gene because the whole sequence of each A. halleri gene was split into several contigs. To further identify A. halleri genes orthologous to A. lyrata genes, we re-assembled the A. halleri contigs based on the mapping information of A. lyrata genes. To collect additional A. halleri genes orthologous to A. lyrata, unmapped A. lyrata genes were re-mapped to the assembled DNA segments by TBLASTN version 2.2.29 (e-value < 1 × 10-5).43 However, the contigs mapped separately by A. lyrata genes may not be orthologous syntenic regions. To focus on only syntenic contigs between A. halleri and A. lyrata, we defined syntenic contigs to which more than two A. lyrata genes within less than five spacer genes in A. lyrata genome were mapped. When an A. lyrata gene was separately mapped to two syntenic contigs between A. lyrata and A. halleri, the contigs were concatenated following the direction of the A. lyrata gene. The A. lyrata gene was then mapped to the concatenated contigs. We thus obtained an additional 3,106 A. halleri gene sequences with >80% similarity and 80% coverage against A. lyrata genes. Finally, we succeeded in identifying 25,833 (79.1%) A. halleri genes orthologous to 32,670 A. lyrata genes. Given that all identified A. halleri genes were paired with A. lyrata genes, a total of 25,833 pairs were defined as A. lyrata–A. halleri (AL–AH) OGGs.In the above procedures, we did not identify pseudogene-like A. halleri genes which are orthologous to A. lyrata genes. Consequently, duplication frequency may be underestimated in either the A. lyrata–A. halleri or the A. halleri lineage. Therefore, we also identified 26,428 orthologous A. halleri regions truncated by terminal codons with >80% similarity and 80% coverage against A. lyrate genes.These analysis procedures and findings are summarized in Supplementary Figure S1.2.4. Validation of A. halleri lineage-specific duplicated genes by droplet digital PCRTo calculate the read coverage of each A. halleri gene, the mapped count was divided by the number of genes to which a read was mapped by BOWTIE2 version 2.2.3.49 Reads per kilobase of exon model per million (RPKM) values were calculated for each A. halleri gene. For 12 A. halleri genes whose copy numbers were known (Supplementary Table S2), we designed primer pairs using the following parameters in the Primer3Plus software:44 primer length of 18–24 bases, amplicon length of 70–150 bp, Tm value of 57–63°C and GC composition of 40–60%.50 To obtain enough genomic DNA for droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), we mixed the genomic DNAs from four individuals of A. halleri from Mt. Ibuki. The genomic DNA was sonicated with the Covaris M220 system (25 s in frequency sweeping mode). The concentration of the sonicated genomic DNA sample was 6 ng/µl. The peak size of sonicated DNA fragments was 2,382 bp according to the Fragment Analyzer system (Advanced Analytical, Ankeny, IA, USA) with the High Sensitivity Genomic DNA Analysis Kit (Advanced Analytical). Each ddPCR reaction was performed with ddPCR EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA). Each reagent was divided into ~20,000 droplets with a droplet generator (Bio-Rad QX-200). Cycled droplets were measured with a QX200 droplet reader (Bio-Rad).To find A. halleri genes whose DNA concentrations were robustly inferred by ddPCR, we first identified uniquely mapped regions (>80 bp) in A. halleri genes from the Illumina DNA-sequencing reads. Among the A. halleri genes with uniquely mapped regions, we manually chose 50 A. halleri genes with a variety of RPKMs. We designed a pair of primers for each gene in the Primer3Plus software using the parameters described earlier. To examine the specificity of the targeted DNAs, we performed real-time PCR analysis using the protocol for the Mx3000P qPCR System (Agilent Technologies). The PCR analyses were performed using SsoFast EvaGreen Supermix (Bio-Rad) and the products were analysed using the Mx3000P multiplex quantitative PCR system (Agilent Technologies). Specific and multiple reactions should result in a single and multiple melting peaks corresponding to the PCR products. Of the 50 primer pairs, 25 showed a clear raised curve for all three replicates. Thus, for the copy number assay by ddPCR, we used 13 primer pairs for unknown copy number genes, 10 pairs for single-copy genes in a broad range of plant species and 2 pairs for a three-copy gene (Supplementary Table S2).2.5. Assembly of A. halleri genes orthologous to A. lyrata genes based on the available draft A. halleri genomeCoding genes of A. halleri were generated on the draft A. halleri genome using long-insert mate paired reads and short-insert paired-end reads in Illumina DNA sequencing.38 On the genome, we used annotated coding genes. We performed BLAST search between the annotated coding A. halleri and A. lyrata genes by BLASTP. The best matching pairs were defined to be AL–AH OGGs with more than >80% similarity to and 80% coverage at amino acid level. We succeeded in identifying 26,007 (79.6%) A. halleri genes which were orthologous to 32,670 A. lyrata genes. Out of 26,007 orthologous pairs of A. halleri and A. lyrata genes, 22,105 (22,105/26,007 = 85%) A. lyrata genes were inferred in the AL–AH OGGs based on only Illumina paired-end DNA-sequencing reads. The number of specifically identified A. halleri genes based on Illumina paired-end DNA sequencing and the available A. helleri genome was 3,728 and 3,902, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, either method had a particular advantage to infer the orthologous genes.A. halleri genes duplicated in the A. lyrata lineage were identified with the Inparanoid algorithm51 Given the best-match pair, A1 and B1, an A. halleri gene that had a smaller sequence distance to A1 (or B1) than the distance between A1 and B1, was added to the AL–AH OGG containing A1 and B1 (seeds). This process was continued until all qualified A. halleri genes were assigned to seed pairs of the genes. 2.6. Selection pressures in the A. halleri-lyrata and A. halleri lineagesTo infer selection pressure in the A. halleri–lyrata lineage, we focussed on orthologous groups that followed the speciation process among the genes of the five non-Arabidopsis species (B. rapa, B. stricta, C. grandiflora, C. rubella, E. salsugineum), A. thaliana, A. lyrata and A. halleri. In each orthologous group, a multiple alignment was made to match the coding regions with the computer programme MAFFT v7.215 with default parameters.52 Using the phylogenetic tree and multiple alignment, we constructed the common ancestral sequences among A. thaliana, A. halleri and A. lyrata, and the common ancestral sequence between A. halleri and A. lyrata with codeml (model = 1, NSsites = 0) in PAML. For each pair of ancestral sequences, the synonymous (KS) and non-synonymous substitution rates (KA) were calculated using yn00 (code = 0, weighting = 0, commonf3x4 = 0) in PAML. To determine whether the KA/KS ratio was significantly <1, two maximum likelihood values were calculated with the KA/KS ratio fixed at 1 and with the KA/KS ratio as a free parameter. The ratio of the maximum likelihood values was then compared with the <U+03C7>2 distribution. A P-value representing the deviation of the two models was then calculated for the A. halleri-lyrata lineage.To infer selection pressure in the A. halleri lineage, we generated a tree file for the A. thaliana, A. lyrata and A. halleri genes. In each of the orthologous groups, a multiple alignment was made to match the coding regions by the computer programme MAFFT.52 Using the tree file and multiple alignment file, we constructed the common ancestral sequences among A. thaliana, A. halleri, and A. lyrata with codeml (model = 1, NSsites = 0) in PAML. Although we used a representative A. halleri gene sequence to infer the ancestral sequence, proper A. halleri genes had sequence variation when they were lineage-specific duplicated after the split from A. lyrata. From the Illumina DNA-sequencing reads mapped to A. halleri genes by BOWTIE2 version 2.2.3 with default parameters,49 the sequence variation was examined in each A. halleri gene by the Picard software with default parameters (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/). When a variable sequence was observed in the A. halleri genes, the codon sequence including the variable nucleotide was concatenated into the representative A. halleri genes. Alignments between A. halleri genes including codons with variable nucleotides and the ancestral sequence were modified by adding codons of the ancestral sequence against concatenated codons including variable nucleotides. KA and KS were calculated in each pair of ancestral and A. halleri gene sequences including variable sequences using yn00 in PAML. To determine whether the KA/KS ratio was significantly <1, two maximum likelihood values were calculated with the KA/KS ratio fixed at 1 and with the KA/KS ratio as a free parameter using codeml in PAML. The ratio of the maximum likelihood values was then compared with the <U+03C7>2 distribution. A P-value representing the deviation of the two models was then calculated for each A. halleri gene. These analysis procedures are summarized in Supplementary Figure S3.2.7. Inference of over-represented gene ontologiesAssuming that A. halleri and A. lyrata genes have similar GO assignments in A. thaliana in the same OGG, we obtained gene ontology (GO) assignments for the A. thaliana genes from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (www.arabidopsis.org). Among the top three GO categories (cellular components, molecular functions, and biological processes), we analysed only biological processes. For each GO category in the biological processes category, the expected ratio was inferred to be the ratio between the number of genes assigned to the GO category and the number of genes not assigned to the GO category among all annotated A. thaliana genes. In each GO category, the observed ratio in each category of OGGs was compared with the expected ratio by a <U+03C7>2 test for different categories of OGGs. The ratios were processed in the R software environment (www.r-project.org) and normalized among different arrays using Z-scores calculated using genescale in the R library. A heatmap was generated using heatmap.2 in the R library. To correct for multiple testing, the false discovery rate (FDR) was estimated by the R-library Q-VALUE software. The null hypothesis was rejected if FDR values were < 0.01.3. Results and discussion3.1. Duplication frequency in the A. halleri-lyrata lineageTo examine the frequency of duplication events in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage (Fig. 2), we first used 25,833 AL–AH OGGs based on Illumina paired-end DNA-sequencing reads. We searched for an orthologous A. thaliana gene for each AL–AH OGG by BLASTP searches between AL and AH OGG protein sequences and annotated A. thaliana protein sequences.43 When both the A. lyrata and A. halleri genes in an AL–AH OGG had the best hit to the same A. thaliana gene, the A. thaliana gene was considered an orthologous candidate gene. Of 25,833 AL–AH OGGs, 93.3% (24,019/25,833) had orthologous candidate genes in A. thaliana. Among these, we searched for orthologous groups that were consistent with the species tree. To do this, the synonymous substitution rates (KS) were calculated among the A. thaliana, A. lyrata, and A. halleri genes in each orthologous group using yn00 in PAML.53 When the KS between A. lyrata and A. halleri was lower than both the KS between A. thaliana and A. lyrata and the KS between A. thaliana and A. halleri, we assumed that the topology of the orthologous group was consistent with the species tree. Among the 24,019 AL–AH OGGs, 22,602 (22,602/24,019 = 94.1%) had the same topology as the species tree. In the 22,602 AL–AH OGGs, 16,704 and 2,370 A. thaliana genes were uniquely and multiply assigned to AL–AH OGGs, respectively. To examine the duplication frequency in A. halleri-lyrata lineage, we considered two evolutionary scenarios for the 2,370 A. thaliana genes multiply assigned to 5,898 OGGs. One is that gene duplication events occurred in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage. That is, the assigned A. thaliana gene is orthologous to the AL–AH OGGs. The other is that gene loss events occurred in the A. thaliana lineage after gene duplication in the common ancestor among A. thaliana, A. lyrata and A. halleri. In this case, the assigned A. thaliana gene is not orthologous to the AL–AH OGGs. To examine these two possible scenarios, we collected AL–AH OGGs to which an A. thaliana gene was assigned as an orthologous gene. We then calculated the KS between the A. thaliana gene and AL–AH OGG, and searched for the closest pair of the AL–AH OGG against the A. thaliana gene. When the KS between the chosen AL-AH OGG and the other AL-AH OGG was lower than the KS in the closest pair, the other AL–AH OGG was defined as sharing the A. thaliana gene as an orthologous gene. Of the 5,898 AL–AH OGGs, 497 had no orthologous A. thaliana genes and 5,401 had 2,370 orthologous A. thaliana genes. In the following analyses, 22,105 (16,704 + 5,401) AL–AH OGG with 19,074 (16,704 + 2,370) orthologous A. thaliana genes were defined as A. thaliana–A. lyrata–A. halleri (AT–AL–AH) OGGs (Supplementary Table S3). These analysis procedures are summarized in Supplementary Figure S4.In A. lyrata-halleri lineage, 22,105 AT–AL–AH OGGs were derived from the 19,074 genes, which represent the number of genes in the common ancestor of A. thaliana, A. lyrata and A. halleri. Thus, 3,031 (22,105-19,074) gains through gene duplication were supposed to have occurred in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage. The gain rate (total gene duplication gains during a given time period divided by the estimated duration per gene) was inferred to be 1.8–2.0 × 10-2 (3,031 gains/19,074 genes/8–9 MY) in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage. Additionally, we examined 26,428 AL–AH OGGs including pseudogene-like A. halleri genes (Supplementary Table S4), and identified 22,684 AT–AL–AH OGGs derived from the 19,318 orthologous A. thaliana genes. The gain rate was inferred to be 1.9–2.2 × 10-2 (3,366 gains/19,318 genes/8–9 MY) in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage. The gain rate in OGGs including pseudogene-like genes (Fig. 4C) is similar to OGGs without pseudogene-like genes, indicating that addition of pseudogene-like A. halleri genes did not affect duplication frequency in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage.Second, we used 26,007 AL–AH OGGs based on the available A. halleri genome. Of 26,007 AL–AH OGGs, 91.0% (23,682/26,007) had orthologous candidate genes in A. thaliana (Supplementary Table S5). Among the 23,682 AL–AH OGGs, 21,984 (21,984/23,682 = 92.8%) had the same topology as the species tree. In the 21,984 AL–AH OGGs, 16,800 and 2,058 A. thaliana genes were uniquely and multiply assigned to AL–AH OGGs, respectively. Since 2,058 A. thaliana genes multiply assigned to 5,183 OGGs, 5,183 OGGs were classified into 446 OGGs which had no orthologous A. thaliana genes and 4,737 OGGs which had 2,058 orthologous A. thaliana genes. Following the above procedure, 21,537 (16,800 + 4,737) AL–AH OGG with 18,858 (16,800 + 2,058) orthologous A. thaliana genes were defined as AT–AL–AH OGGs. The gain rate was inferred to be 1.6–1.8 × 10-2 (2,679 gains/18,858 genes/8–9 MY) in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage. Taken together, the gain rate without pseudogene-like A. halleri genes was 1.6–2.0 × 10-2 in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage (Fig. 2).In our previous study, we inferred the gain rate of gene duplication in the lineage leading to Arabidopsis after the divergence of moss.4 Using the same method, we re-estimated the gain rates in three times periods—after the divergence of moss (Physcomitrella patens), rice (Oryza sativa) and poplar (Populus trichocarpa). The gain rates were 1.8–3.5 × 10-3 in the three branches, ~10 times lower than in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage (Fig. 2). One explanation for this gain rate is that even though many genes were fixed and retained, a large number of them did not survive in the long run. This explanation is consistent with the gradual decay of paralog synonymous substitution rates observed in several eukaryotes over time.54,55Note that the effect of tandemly duplicated genes on these gain rates needs to be considered because tandemly duplicated genes have undergone gene conversion, which leads to identical sequences among tandemly duplicated genes in the same species.56 Consequently, our procedure may have failed to identify some orthologous A. halleri genes among the A. lyrata tandemly duplicated genes. In such cases, our method would have missed the duplication event in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage, meaning our gain rate is underestimated in the A. lyrata-halleri lineage. Thus, tandemly duplicated genes did not disturb the trend of a higher gain rate in A. halleri-lyrata in comparison with other land plants.3.2. Duplication frequency in the A. halleri lineageThe copy numbers of the A. halleri genes were unclear from AT–AL–AH OGGs. However, the absolute copy number of an A. halleri gene could be experimentally inferred by the absolute DNA concentration of the gene by ddPCR.57 First, to examine the relationship between copy number and DNA concentration, we focussed on known three-copy genes, HMA441 and MTP1,58 and 10 singleton genes that share a single copy in a broad range of plants.59 The concentration of HMA4 was 627.5 ± 40.39 and 626.75 ± 39.38 copies/µl (four replicates for each of the two primer pairs, average of each primer pair ± 95% CI). The concentration of MTP1 was 605.0 ± 22.39. Conversely, the concentration of the 10 singleton genes was 193.30 ± 9.06 copies/µl (four replicates for each of the 10 primer pairs, average of all 10 primer pairs ± 95% CI). The average DNA concentration was ~3.2 times higher for the three-copy genes compared with the single-copy genes (Fig. 3A), indicating that the copy number corresponded to the DNA concentration inferred by ddPCR. Relationship between the Illumina DNA-sequencing read depth and the copy number inferred by ddPCR. (A) The Y-axis represents copy numbers per µl inferred by ddPCR.

The regression line was calculated with the simple formula Y = aX; a was inferred by the least squares method.The copy numbers of the A. halleri genes could also be inferred by the reading depth of the Illumina DNA-sequencing reads. The reading depth was defined as the RPKM. To examine whether RPKM values corresponded with copy numbers, we focussed on 25 A. halleri genes that had a wide variety of RPKMs (see section 2). For these genes, the copy number estimated by digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) was compared with the RPKM. Consequently, we found that RPKM was significantly correlated with concentration (Fig. 3B, R2 = 0.94). This result indicated that RPKM values could be used an index of copy numbers for A. halleri genes.To infer duplication frequencies by RPKM values, we focussed on 285 AT–AL–AH OGGs with single-copy genes in a broad range of plant species such as Arabidopsis, Carica, Populus, Vitis, Oryza, Selaginella and Physcomitrella.59 The RPKM values of the A. halleri genes showed a normal distribution (Supplementary Fig. S5A). To call duplicated genes, the top 5% (309) of RPKMs was defined as the threshold for duplicated genes. That is, A. halleri genes with an RPKM < 309 were defined as non-duplicated genes, A. halleri genes with RPKM values from 309 to 618 (309 × 2) were defined as two-copy genes, and A. halleri genes with RPKM values of 618–927 (309 × 3) were defined as three-copy genes. Following this rule, in 22,105 AT–AL–AH OGGs based on Illumina paired-end DNA-sequencing reads, we identified 2,488 multiply duplicated A. halleri genes and 3,378 gain events through gene duplications in the A. halleri lineage (Supplementary Table S3). The gain rate (total gains from gene duplication during a given time period divided by the estimated duration per gene) was 7.6 × 10-2 (3,378 gains/22,105 genes/2 MY).However, the gain events may have been over-estimated because duplication events occurring in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage caused an increase of RPKMs. Therefore, excluding A. halleri genes that were duplicated in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage, we counted the number of gain events in the A. halleri lineage. Among the currently retained A. halleri genes, we focussed on 16,946 A. halleri genes that had not undergone gene duplication in the A.halleri-lyrata lineage. These 16,946 genes had undergone 1,958 gain events through gene duplication in the A. halleri lineage. The re-estimated gain rate was 5.8 × 10-2 (1,958 gains/16,946 genes/2 MY). The gain rate (5.8–7.6 × 10-2) of duplicate genes in the A. halleri lineage was approximately four times higher than the gain rate (1.6–2.0 × 10-2) in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage (Fig. 2). As mentioned earlier, the gain rate difference can be explained by a rapid decay of duplicated genes. However, this gain rate did not include gene duplications derived from pseudogenes which were on the earlier process of decayed genes. To determine the decayed effect in the A. halleri lineage, we focussed on 22,684 AT–AL–AH OGGs including pseudogene-like genes (Supplementary Table S4). Out of 22,684 OGGs, the gain rate in the A. halleri lineage was 1.2 × 10-1 (5,665 gains/22,684 genes/2 MY). Thus, the gain rate including pseudogenes-like A. halleri genes was approximately two times higher than the gain rate (7.6 × 10-2) without any pseudogene-like A. halleri genes. This result indicates that pseudogene-like A. halleri genes accelerated the gain rates in the A. halleri lineage. To determine whether pseudogenes tended to have a higher duplication rate in comparison with non-pseudogene-like genes, we fosused on 1,159 AT–AL–AH OGGs composing only pseudogene-like A. halleri genes among 22,684 AT–AL–AH OGGs including pseudogene-like genes. We then identified 713 pseudogene-like A. halleri genes experiencing gene duplications in either the A. halleri-lyrata or the A. halleri lineage. In the case of 22,105 AT–AL–AH OGGs without any pseudogene-like A. halleri genes, we identified 6,752 A. halleri genes experiencing gene duplications in either the A. halleri-lyrata or the A. halleri lineage. The proportion (713/1,159 = 62%) of duplicated genes in pseudogene-like A. halleri genes was significantly higher than that (6,752/22,105 = 31%) of duplicated genes in the other A. halleri genes (P-value = 1.9 × 10-107 by <U+03C7>2 test, Table 1), indicating that most of pseudogenes tended to appear via gene duplication in Arabidopsis. Taken together, it is likely that most of recently duplicated genes in Arabidopsis may be on the process of decayed genes but some of duplicated genes significantly contributed to functional divergence among Arabidopsis species. Comparison of gene duplication to non-gene duplication ratio in either A. halleri-lyrata or A. halleri lineage between OGGs including pseudogene-like A. halleri genes and OGGs without any pseudogene-like A. halleri genesComparison of gene duplication to non-gene duplication ratio in either A. halleri-lyrata or A. halleri lineage between OGGs including pseudogene-like A. halleri genes and OGGs without any pseudogene-like A. halleri genesUsing 21,537 AT–AL–AH OGGs based on the available A. halleri genome, we identified 1,248 gain events in 838 genes (Supplementary Table S5). The gain rate was 2.9 × 10-2 (1,248 gains/21,537/2MY). The gain rate was approximately half in comparison with the gain rate (5.8–7.6 × 10-2) inferred by RPKMs. Therefore, copy number information inferred by ddPCR was compared with the number of A. halleri lineage-specific duplicated genes. Most of OGGs had single-copy genes in A. halleri although various duplication frequencies were inferred by ddPCR (Supplemental Fig. S5B). These results indicate that some of gene duplication tended to be missed in a genome assembly based only on Illumina short reads. This shows that the reading depth of raw Illumina reads may be informative for inferring the number of recently duplicated genes.3.3. Selection pressures in the A. halleri-lyrata lineageWe found that 23–30% of OGGs had undergone gene duplications in the Arabidopsis lineage at high gain rates (1.6–7.6 × 10-2 gains/gene/MY), which were 10 times higher than the rates inferred by comparative genomics among Arabidopsis, poplar, rice and moss (Fig. 2). Therefore, we were interested in investigating the functional divergence of duplicated genes in Arabidopsis. To infer the functional divergence of duplicated genes in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage, we tried to infer the ancestral sequences of the most recent common ancestor of A. thaliana, A. lyrata and A. halleri. To define the node of the most recent common ancestor among A. thaliana, A. lyrata, and A. halleri, we used an orthologous non-Arabidopsis gene as an outgroup sequence for each of AT–AL–AH OGGs and performed BLASTP searches of AT–AL–AH protein sequences against all five non-Arabidopsis (B. rapa, B. stricta, C. grandiflora, C. rubella, E. salsugineum) protein sequences.43 When the best-hit non-Arabidopsis gene was the same for the A. thaliana, A. lyrata and A. halleri genes, the non-Arabidopsis gene was considered a candidate orthologous gene to the AT–AL–AH OGG. For each of candidate genes, we searched for candidate orthologous groups that were consistent with the species tree. To do this, we generated a phylogenetic tree by the neighbour-joining method using the PAUP software (set outroot = mono, dset distance = hky).60,61 When the topology of the gene tree was the same as that of the species tree, we assumed that the topology of the orthologous group was consistent with the species tree. There were 22,105 and 21,537 AT–AL–AH OGGs based on Illumina paired-end DNA-sequencing reads and the available A. halleri genomes, respectively. Out of 22,105 and 21,537 AL–AH OGGs, we identified 17,669 and 17,925 orthologous groups that followed the speciation process among non-Arabidopsis, A. thaliana, A. lyrata, and A. halleri genes, respectively (Supplementary Table S3). These OGGs were defined as non-A-AT–AL–AH OGGs. These analysis procedures are summarized in Supplementary Figure S6.Based on the phylogenetic tree in each non-A-AT–AL–AH OGG, we inferred the ancestor sequences of all nodes using codeml in the PAML package,53 and calculated KA and KS in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage. First, among the 17,669 OGGs base on Illumina paired-end DNA-sequencing reads, we found 481, 8,313 and 8,875 genes with positive selection (KA/KS > 1), purifying selection (KA/KS < 1) and unclear selection respectively, by the maximum likelihood approach (Supplementary Table S3). To address whether the duplicated genes contributed to functional divergence in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage, the proportions of positive selection and purifying selection in 1,782 duplicated genes were compared with those in 15,887 non-duplicated genes. In this test, the null model was the ratio of duplicated genes to non-duplicated genes without any particular selection pressure in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage. The proportions of positive selection in the duplicated genes was significantly higher than those in the non-duplicated genes (P-value = 2.8 × 10-57 by <U+03C7>2 test, Fig. 4A). The proportion of purifying selection in the non-duplicated genes was significantly higher than in the duplicated genes in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage (P-value = 1.2 × 10-33 by <U+03C7>2 test, Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we did the same analysis in 17,925 OOGs based on the available A. halleri genome (Supplementary Table S5). We found the same trend for only positive selection in the OOGs (P-value = 3.0 × 10-36 for positive selection, P-value = 0.05 for purifying selection by <U+03C7>2 test, Fig. 4B). These results indicate that gene duplication induced functional divergence in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage. Gene duplication and selection pressure in the A. halleri-lyrata and A. halleri lineages.

Selection pressure in the A. halleri lineageTo infer selection pressure in the A. halleri lineage, we generated ancestral sequences of the A. lyrata and A. halleri genes using A. thaliana genes as outgroups. When an A. halleri gene did not have any sequence variation in the Illumina DNA-sequencing reads, KS and KA were simply calculated by comparing the ancestral sequence to the representative A. halleri gene sequence. When sequence variation for a representative A. halleri gene sequence was identified from the Illumina DNA-sequencing reads, KS and KA were separately calculated for the varied sequences (see Materials and Methods, Supplementary Fig. S4). Among the 22,105 AT–AL–AH OGGs based on Illumina paired-end DNA-sequencing reads, we found 568, 7,717, and 13,820 genes with positive selection (KA/KS > 1), purifying selection (KA/KS < 1) and unclear selection, respectively, in the A. halleri lineage by the maximum likelihood approach (Supplementary Table S3). To examine the relationship between the effect of gene duplication and selection pressures in the A. halleri lineage, the proportions of positive selection and purifying selection in 2,488 duplicated genes were compared with those in 19,617 non-duplicated genes. In this test, the null model was the ratio of duplicated genes to non-duplicated genes in the A. halleri lineage. As observed in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage, the proportions of positive selection in the duplicated genes were significantly higher than those in the non-duplicated genes (P-value = 2.3 × 10-6 for positive selection by <U+03C7>2 test, Fig. 4C), while the proportion of purifying selection in the non-duplicated genes was significantly higher than in the duplicated genes (P-value = 1.9 × 10-26 by <U+03C7>2 test, Fig. 4C). We did the same analysis in 21,537 AT–AL–AH OOGs based on the available A. halleri genome (Supplementary Table S5). We found the same trend in the OOGs (P-value = 9.9 × 10-15 for positive selection, P-value = 2.2 × 10-18 for purifying selection by <U+03C7>2 test, Fig. 4D). These results indicate that gene duplication induced functional divergence in the A. halleri lineage as well.Functional divergence may not occur immediately after gene duplication. To determine whether gene duplication in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage affected selection pressures in the A. halleri lineage, we classified the 22,105 AT–AL–AH OGGs based on Illumina paired-end DNA-sequencing reads into 5,159 OGGs with gene duplications and 16,946 OGGs without any gene duplications, focusing on the A. halleri-lyrata lineage. The proportions of positive selection and purifying selection in the duplicated genes in the A. halleri lineage were compared with those in the non-duplicated genes. In this test, the null model was the ratio of duplicated genes to non-duplicated genes in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage. The proportion of positive selection in the duplicated genes was significantly higher than those in the non-duplicated genes (P-value = 1.3 × 10-72 for positive selection by <U+03C7>2 test, Fig. 4E). The proportion of purifying selection in the non-duplicated genes was significantly higher than in the duplicated genes (P-value = 1.9 × 10-85 by <U+03C7>2 test, Fig. 4E). We did the same analysis in 21,537 based on the available A. halleri genome. We again found the same trend (P-value = 4.8 × 10-81 for positive selection, P-value = 1.1 × 10-39 for purifying selection by <U+03C7>2 test, Fig. 4F). These results indicate that gene duplication in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage contributed to functional divergence in the A. halleri lineage.To determine whether gene duplications in the A. halleri-lyrata or A. halleri lineage contributed to functional divergence in the A. halleri lineage, we focussed on two categories of OGGs—genes not duplicated in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage but duplicated in the A. halleri lineage (1,593 OGGs), and genes duplicated in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage but not duplicated in the A. halleri lineage (4,264 OGGs). The proportions of positive selection and purifying selection in the A. halleri lineage were compared in the two categories. In this test, the null model was the ratio of the two categories of OGGs (1,593 and 4,264 OGGs). The proportions of positive selection in genes duplicated only in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage were significantly higher than in genes duplicated only in the A. halleri lineage (P-value = 7.3 × 10-9 for positive selection by <U+03C7>2 test, Fig. 4G). Conversely, the proportion of purifying selection in genes duplicated only in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage was significantly lower than in genes duplicated only in the A. halleri lineage (P-value = 2.9 × 10-8 by <U+03C7>2 test, Fig. 4G). We did the same analysis in 21,537 based on based on the available A. halleri genome. We found the same trend (P-value = 0.04 for positive selection, P-value = 0.02 for purifying selection in the available genome by <U+03C7>2 test, Fig. 4H). These results indicate that gene duplication in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage was the main determinant of the elevated proportion of positive selection in the A. halleri lineage.3.5. Functional bias of genes under positive or purifying selection in the A. halleri-lyrata and A. halleri lineagesWe found that gene duplication contributed to functional divergence in comparison with non-duplicated genes in Arabidopsis but many duplicated genes had been retained with purifying selection, which induces an increase of gene dosage. Thus, we were interested in investigating the functional bias in duplicated and non-duplicated genes with positive/purifying selection in the A. halleri-lyrata and A. halleri lineages. OGGs based on Illumina paired-end DNA-sequencing reads were classified into duplicated and non-duplicated genes in the A. halleri-lyrata and A. halleri lineages. The OGGs were then further classified by positive and purifying selection. This gave a total of eight classes. In each class, we examined the degree of over-representation in 1,504 GO categories compared with the number of GO categories assigned to A. thaliana genes (see Section 2) (Fig. 5). Although two classes with no duplication and purifying selection were clustered into one group, the other six classes were not essentially clustered with each other. These results indicate that the evolutionary direction of A. halleri was quite different in the A. halleri-lyrata and A. halleri lineages with respect to either gene dosage by gene duplication or functional divergence by positive selection. Over-represented functional categories. The X-axis represents different kinds of OGGs. OGGs were classified into duplicated genes and non-duplicated genes in the A. halleri-lyrata (AHL) and A. halleri (AH) lineages. The OGGs were then further classified by positive or purifying selection. The Y-axis represents 1,504 GO categories (biological processes) assigned to A. thaliana genes belonging to the OGGs. The key shows the relationship between colour and the z-score of over-representation in the GO categories. Red and green indicate low and high over-representation, respectively. The ratio of observed gene numbers in selected OGGs to expected gene numbers inferred from the data for all annotated genes was calculated in each GO category. Over-represented functional categories. The X-axis represents different kinds of OGGs. OGGs were classified into duplicated genes and non-duplicated genes in the A. halleri-lyrata (AHL) and A. halleri (AH) lineages. The OGGs were then further classified by positive or purifying selection. The Y-axis represents 1,504 GO categories (biological processes) assigned to A. thaliana genes belonging to the OGGs. The key shows the relationship between colour and the z-score of over-representation in the GO categories. Red and green indicate low and high over-representation, respectively. The ratio of observed gene numbers in selected OGGs to expected gene numbers inferred from the data for all annotated genes was calculated in each GO category. To examine the kinds of genes associated with phenotypic differences among A. thaliana, A. lyrata and A. halleri, we identified significantly over-represented GO categories in OGGs with gene duplication and purifying selection, OGGs with gene duplication and positive selection and OGGs with non-duplication and positive selection in the A. halleri–A. lyrata and A. halleri lineages. OGGs with non-duplication and purifying selection were disregarded in the analysis because such genes tended to have the same functions in A. halleri, A. lyrata and A. halleri. From the GO categories assigned to the A. thaliana genes belonging to the OGGs, over-represented GO categories were identified (Supplementary Table S6; see Section 2, FDR < 0.01).When we focussed on metal and zinc tolerance or accumulation among A. thaliana, A. lyrata and A. halleri, both A. lyrata and A. halleri had a higher tolerance to metal and zinc than A. thaliana.36 In particular, both metal and zinc tend to be accumulated in A. halleri compared with A. lyrata.62,63 This observation suggests that metal tolerance is enhanced in the A. halleri–A. lyrata lineage, and that metal accumulation is enhanced in the A. halleri lineage. Genes associated with metal and zinc transporters/responses were highly duplicated with purifying selection in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage, indicating that the dosages of genes associated with metal responses and transporters had been enhanced in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage. Furthermore, genes associated with metal and zinc responses were highly duplicated with purifying selection in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage, indicating that the dosages of genes associated with metal and zinc responses had been enhanced in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage. Thus, tolerance or accumulation of metal and zinc was enhanced in the A. halleri-lyrata and A. halleri lineages through gene duplication.Genes associated with the reproductive system, cell cycle, various developments, various metabolites, epigenetics, metabolites, abiotic and biotic responses were subject to positive selection in either the A. halleri-lyrata or A. halleri lineage (Supplementary Table S6). However, we do not have any clear idea why such genes were subject to positive selection. Additionally, genes associated with various ubiquitous processes tended to be duplicated in either the A. halleri-lyrata or the A. halleri lineage with purifying selection (Supplementary Table S6). These over-represented functional categories may contribute to phenotypic differences between A. thaliana and either A. lyrata or A. halleri through high dosages. However, we do not know the phenotypic differences associated with these functional categories. These duplicated genes might have been retained because increased gene dosages associated with these functional categories were not too disadvantageous for A. halleri. To avoid gaining novel functions, these genes may be under purifying selection. In the future, these duplicated genes may be lost if disadvantageous functions appear. Indeed, the A. halleri-lyrata and A. halleri lineages have extraordinarily high retention rates of duplicated genes in comparison with earlier plant lineages. These observations indicate that most of the duplicated genes in the A. halleri-lyrata and A. halleri lineages may be lost in future evolution.3.6. Concluding remarksIn this analysis, we generated 25,833 A. halleri genes that were orthologous to 79.1% of the annotated A. lyrata genes from contigs generated from only paired-end reads of Illumina DNA-sequencing. On the other hands, we inferred 26,007 AH-AL OOGs based on the available A. halleri genome. Out of 32,670 A. lyrata genes, 79.6% were identified as orthologous genes to A. halleri genes. Thus, our method inferring orthologous genes is compatible to a method to infer orthologous genes based on the available genome. However, it has significant limitations for examining gene loss, exon shuffling and heterozygosity because it does not infer any new genes in the genomes. Nevertheless, the number of duplicated genes inferred by reading depth of Illumina DNA-sequencing reads is likely to be more reliable in comparison with duplicated genes identified on scaffolds generated by Illumina DNA-sequencing reads (Supplementary Fig. S5B). Therefore, this procedure is useful for inferring lineage-specific duplicated genes resulting from such events as SSDs.The gain rates based on 25, 833 AL–AH OGGs based on both Illumina paired-end DNA-sequencing reads and the available A. halleri genome were 1.6–2.0 × 10-2 per gene per MY in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage (Fig. 2). Furthermore, using the only mapping coverage of the Illumina DNA-sequencing reads, the gain rate was inferred to be 5.7–7.6 × 10-2 in the A. halleri lineage because gene duplication tended to be missed in a genome assembly based on Illumina short reads. That is, the gain rates were inferred to be 1.6–2.0 and 5.7–7.6 × 10-2 per gene per MY in the A. halleri-lyrata and A. halleri lineages, respectively. The gain rate in the A. halleri lineage was approximately four times higher than in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage. Using our previous data, we re-estimated the gain rates in the three time periods after the divergence of mosses, rice and poplar (Fig. 2). The inferred gain rates (1.8–3.0 × 10-3) were ~10 times lower than in the Arabidopsis lineage (Fig. 2). Thus, gain rates tend to increase as the evolutionary period gets younger. One explanation for this gain rate difference is that duplicated genes tend to rapidly decay over time. This explanation is supported by a higher rate of pseudogenization in recently duplicated genes in comparison with non-duplicated genes (Table 1). Also, several previous reports showed that younger duplicated genes tended to be relaxed compared with older duplicated genes.54,55,64–67 That is, most anciently duplicated genes tend not to be retained in current species. Consequently, the gain rates inferred in earlier evolutional periods tend to decrease.To investigate the functional divergence of duplicated genes in the A. halleri-lyrata and A. halleri lineages, we identified OGGs under either positive or purifying selection in these lineages based on the ratio of nonsynonymous and synonymous substitution rates (KA/KS). Interestingly, the proportions of positive and purifying selection tended to increase and decrease, respectively, when gene duplication occurred in either the A. halleri-lyrata or A. halleri lineage. This result indicates that gene duplication tends to enhance functional divergence in comparison with non-duplicated genes in the Arabidopsis lineage. In contrast, the general observation is that duplicated genes tend to have less functional divergence in yeasts, plants and mammals.24,68,69 This is because functionally important genes are more likely to be retained as duplicates.68 This contradictory relationship might derive from the duplication ages. Most previous analyses have examined recently observed selection pressures in anciently duplicated genes. When functional divergence was examined in recently duplicated genes, the duplicated genes tended to have higher functional divergence than singletons.70 Together, these results suggest duplicated genes tend to have higher functional divergence immediately after duplication than singletons.How long gene duplication accelerates functional divergence remains an open question. To address this, we examined whether gene duplication in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage (2–10 MYA) accelerated functional divergence in the A. halleri lineage (<2 MYA). Interestingly, we found that gene duplication in the A. halleri-lyrata lineage enhanced the proportion of positive selection in the A. halleri lineage (Fig. 4E–H). This result indicated that the functional divergence of duplicated genes was accelerated several MY after gene duplication. If gene duplication is too deleterious for a gene, the gene tends to be lost immediately after duplication. If not, duplicated genes may be retained for a long period without functional divergence because functional divergence may be evolutionarily disadvantageous. Therefore, immediately after duplication, most duplicated genes might be under functional constraints in comparison with genes duplicated several MY earlier. Indeed, many recently duplicated genes have functional redundancy in A. thaliana17,18 and in mammals.71 These young duplicated genes tend to be less functionally constrained than singletons, and may have the potential to obtain an essential function to survive in new environments.Finally, we examined the kinds of genes that were duplicated and/or under positive selection in the A. halleri-lyrata and A. halleri lineages. Different functional categories tended to have experienced gene duplication and/or selection pressure in the A. halleri-lyrata and A. halleri lineages. For example, A. halleri is known as a heavy metal hyper-accumulator with high metal tolerance. A. lyrata is tolerant of heavy-metal ions in the soil to some degree but A. thaliana is not. Genes related to heavy-metal tolerance and accumulation tended to be highly duplicated with purifying selection in the A. halleri-lyrata and A. halleri lineages. Earlier studies reported that metal tolerance was enhanced by increasing gene dosage through gene duplication.41 Our results supported this trend at a genomic scale. Taken together, the results of our study reveal that lineage-specific duplicated genes have contributed to species-specific evolution in Arabidopsis.4.

In addition to the genetic information encoded in the nucleotide sequence, an epigenetic level of information is encoded in DNA modifications, which play a fundamental role in the differentiation and development of eukaryotic cells, in cancer development and prevention, aging, and acclimation to cellular and environmental stimuli.1,2 DNA modification is carried out by methyltransferases, which transfer methyl groups from the universal substrate S-adenosyl-methionine (AdoMet) to their respective recognition sequences. Among bacteria, epigenetic modifications have been most commonly associated with the genome-wide methylation of specific DNA sequences, which are linked to restriction-modification (RM)-based defense mechanisms against foreign DNA, such as the DNA from phages.3,4 C5-cytosine methylation is regarded as the most common DNA modification in eukaryotes,5 but N6-adenine methylation has also been reported.6–8 Prokaryotic DNA methyltransferases typically catalyze N6-adenine, N4- or C5-cytosine methylation.In addition to the methyltransferases in RM systems, many prokaryotic genomes harbour orphan DNA methyltransferases that act independently of the RM systems. Most of these solitary or orphan methyltransferases are not well characterized, but functions in the regulation of gene expression, DNA replication, repair, and others have been suggested.9 One of the most widespread and best characterized orphan methyltransferases is the E. coli Dam enzyme, an N6-adenine-specific methyltransferase modifying the target sequence GATC. Dam methylation plays an important role in DNA repair and replication (reviewed in [9]) but also in the regulation of gene expression10 or phase variation of uropathogenic E. coli.11,12 Dcm, which mediates cytosine DNA methylation, is another widespread orphan methyltransferase activity found in 162 strains of E. coli.13 The molecular details of how DNA methylation regulates gene expression and subsequently the cell cycle have been elucidated in the bacterial model system Caulobacter crescentus.14Single molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing permits the parallel estimation of the methylation status of specific nucleotides. It was first used for the direct methylome profiling of Mycoplasma pneumoniae.15 More recently, SMRT sequencing has been applied to characterize the methylomes of 230 prokaryotic strains, revealing that the majority of them contain extensive and variable DNA methylation patterns.16 Cyanobacteria, which are the only prokaryotes that perform oxygenic photosynthesis and are increasingly used as cell factories in green biotechnology,17 have been only scarcely characterized with regard to epigenetic modifications. In Anabaena sp. PCC 7120, four different orphan methyltransferases were detected in addition to the enzymes of the endogenous RM systems.18 A high degree of adenine methylation was reported for the marine cyanobacterium Trichodesmium sp. NIBB1067.19 In the present study, we analyzed the methylome of the model cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (hereafter Synechocystis), which seems to be virtually free of endogenous restriction endonucleases.20 Nevertheless, the chromosomal DNA of Synechocystis was found to be methylated, and the genome contains several orphan methyltransferase genes. Only the cytosine-specific orphan methyltransferase M.Ssp6803I, encoded by gene slr0214, was previously analyzed.20 The M.Ssp6803I-dependent modification of the m5CGATCG motif improved the integration efficiency of external DNA into the Synechocystis chromosome.21 Here, we present the first methylome analysis of Synechocystis, which identified five DNA methylation recognition sequences and the corresponding methyltransferases.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strains and culture conditionsSynechocystis sp. 6803 substrain PCC-M22 was used in all experiments. The axenic strain was maintained on agar plates supplemented with BG11 mineral medium23 at 30°C under constant illumination. Transformants were initially selected on media containing 10 µg ml-1 kanamycin (Km; Sigma), while the segregation of clones and cultivation of mutants was performed at 50 µg ml-1 Km. For physiological characterization, axenic cultures of the different strains (Supplementary Table S1) were grown photoautotrophically in BG11 medium, either under slight shaking in Erlenmeyer flasks at 50 µmol photons s-1 m-2, or under bubbling with CO2-enriched air (5% [v/v]) in batch cultures at 29°C under continuous illumination of 180 µmol photons s-1 m-2 (warm light, Osram L58 W32/3). Contamination by heterotrophic bacteria was evaluated by microscopy or spreading of 0.2 mL culture on LB plates. The E. coli strains TG1, TOP10, and DH5a were used for routine DNA manipulations. E. coli was cultured in LB medium at 37°C. Growth was followed by measurements of the optical density at 750 nm (OD750) for Synechocystis and at 500 nm (OD500) for E. coli.2.2. Methylome analysisFor SMRT sequencing, high quality genomic DNA was isolated using the CTAB protocol.24 Libraries were prepared according to the large SMRTbell gDNA protocol (Pacific Biosciences) with 10 kb insert size. Genomic DNA was sequenced with a PacBio RS II platform. Base modifications were analyzed using the program RS_Modification_Detection.1 from Pacific Biosciences (v. 2.3.0). For bisulfite sequencing, ~200 ng of DNA were bisulfite treated with the Zymo Gold kit (Zymo Research) and libraries constructed using the Ovation Ultra-Low Methyl-Seq library kit (NuGEN) following manufacturer’s instructions, followed by sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq2500 system yielding 2 559 017 raw reads. The sequences were quality filtered and adapter trimmed using Trimmomatic v0.3625) and FastQC v0.67 (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/ (1 February 2018, date last accessed)) leaving 2 552 913 reads for further analysis. For mapping to the Synechocystis chromosome and quantitative evaluation we used Bismark (v0.17 with default options26) in conjunction with Bowtie 2.27 All SMRT and Illumina sequencing raw data are available from the National Center for Biotechnology Information at https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/8378604 (1 February 2018, date last accessed) (BioProject ID: PRJNA430784, BioSample: SAMN08378604, SRA: SRS2844079).2.3. DNA manipulationsThe isolation of total DNA from Synechocystis was performed as described previously.20 All other DNA techniques, such as plasmid isolation, transformation of E. coli, ligations and restriction analysis (restriction enzymes were obtained from Promega and New England Biolabs) followed standard methods.28 For the restriction analyses using chromosomal DNA from Synechocystis, the restriction endonucleases were used in a 10-fold excess and were incubated for at least 16 h at 37°C to ensure complete digestion. Synthetic primers were deduced from the complete genome sequence of Synechocystis29 for the specific amplification of putative DNA-specific methyltransferase-coding genes (Supplementary Table S2). Interposon mutagenesis was used to generate mutants defective in these genes. For this purpose, DNA fragments containing their encoding sequences were amplified by PCR and cloned into pGEM-T (Promega). The aphII gene, conferring Km resistance from pUC4K (Pharmacia), was introduced into selected restriction sites (see Supplementary Table S1, Figs 2, 3, and 5), and verified constructs were transferred into Synechocystis as described.202.4. Generation of complementation strainsFor the ectopic expression of sll0729 and ssl1378, their coding sequences were fused to the regulatory sequences of the ziaA gene. The upstream region of ziaA, including PziaA, its 5'-UTR, and the upstream ziaR-gene, as well as sll0729 or ssl1378, were amplified by PCR (for oligonucleotides, see Supplementary Table S2). The PCR products were digested with ClaI, followed by heat inactivation. The digested products were ligated and re-amplified with PCR, and the resulting PziaA::sll0729 and PziaA::ssl1378 fusions were cloned into the self-replicating, broad-host range vector pVZ322 via XbaI/XhoI cleavage sites. The resulting plasmids were introduced into <U+0394>sll0729 via conjugal transfer, as described previously.302.5. Generation of recombinant proteins and methyltransferase assayFor overexpression and purification of the putative DNA-specific methyltransferases, the open reading frames (ORFs) were amplified from chromosomal DNA by PCR using primers for the directed in-frame cloning with the N-terminal His-tag into vectors of the pBAD/His A, B, C series (Invitrogen). Correct insertions were verified by sequencing. For overexpression, recombinant cells of the methyltransferase-defective E. coli strain TOP10 were cultured at 30°C in LB medium. The expression of the recombinant protein was induced at OD500 = 1.0 by addition of arabinose (0.002% final concentration). The proteins were extracted from E. coli by sonication, and the fusion proteins were purified on a Ni-NTA matrix (ProBondTM Resin, novex, life technologies) after elution with an imidazole gradient. The resulting protein fractions were evaluated using SDS gels containing 12% acrylamide. The recombinant proteins were detected by immuno-blotting with an antibody specific for the N-terminal His-tag (Invitrogen).The DNA-specific methyltransferase activity was assayed by incubation of non-methylated chromosomal DNA of Micrococcus lysodeikticus (Sigma) with [3H]-AdoMet (Amersham), as described.20 The protein content was estimated according to reference.312.6. Phylogenetic analysisThe phylogenetic comparison included up to 20 of the most similar proteins found in BlastP searches32,33 against Genbank with the amino acid sequence of M.Ssp6803II (Sll0729). In addition, the characterized DNA methyltransferases M.Ssp6803I (Slr0214), M.Ssp6803III (Slr1803) and some closely related proteins, as well as functionally characterized methyltransferases, were included. The protein sequences were aligned using ClustalW34 embedded in the BioEdit software package. Extended sequence parts were manually removed from the N-terminal and C-terminal ends. The phylogenetic tree was calculated in MEGA5 using the neighbour joining method.353. Results3.1. The Synechocystis methylomeSMRT and bisulfite sequencing were used to analyze the Synechocystis methylome. The mCGATCG motif was previously characterized but the nature of the methylation could only be inferred based on protein similarity.20 Bisulfite sequencing permits the direct detection of 5-methylcytosines, which was found for this motif, yielding m5CGATCG (Supplementary Fig. S1). In addition, SMRT sequencing indicated that the Synechocystis genome harbours at least four further methylation recognition sequences, which were found on the chromosome with different frequencies: GGmCC, Gm6ATC, GAm6AGGC, and GGm6AN7TTGG/CCAm6AN7TCC (Fig. 1, Table 1). The SMRT sequencing results showed the methylation of GGmCC at the first C but failed to identify the precise modification. While SMRT sequencing can detect m6A with high accuracy and sensitivity, it is less sensitive towards m4C and performs badly on m5C methylation.36 However, standard bisulfite sequencing protocols may also be used to map m4C, because m4C is partially resistant to bisulfite-mediated deamination.37 Indeed, we observed a GGmCC methylation frequency of ~50% (Supplementary Fig. S1), matching previous records on the efficiency of bisulfite treatment for the detection of m4C.37 In contrast, the methylation at C5 position of m5CGATCG motifs was detected to 100% by bisulfite sequencing (Supplementary Fig. S1) but was not observed by the SMRT method. The fact that the GGCC methylation was detected both by SMRT and by bisulfite sequencing suggests that it is at the N4 position (GGm4CC). The bisulfite sequencing data were used for a global analysis of the methylation of CGATCG and GGCC sites (Supplementary Fig. S2). This analysis revealed 80–85% methylated m5CGATCG sites. About 10% of the sites seem to be not completely or unmethylated (Supplementary Fig. S2A). In the case of the GGCC methylation site, bisulfite sequencing revealed 90% of all sites being GGm4CC (Supplementary Fig. S2C). The great majority of modifications of GGCC and CGATCG sites is consistent with previous restriction analysis, where DNA isolated from Synechocystis was resistant to treatment with methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes HaeIII (recognition sequence GGCC), PvuI (recognition sequence CGATCG), and MboI (recognition sequence GATC).20 Similarly, the DNA of the marine cyanobacterium Trichodesmium sp. NIBB1067 was also modified at GATC sites leading to stimulation or inhibition of methylation-dependent restriction enzymes.19Methyltransferases in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803Methyltransferases in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803Overview of the methylome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The methylome of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 comprises five different methylation motifs, which were detected using SMRT (Pacific Biosciences) and bisulfite sequencing. The genome plot shows the distribution of the recognition sequences on both strands of the chromosome and was made by using DNAPlotter.54Overview of the methylome of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. The methylome of Synechocystis sp. strain PCC 6803 comprises five different methylation motifs, which were detected using SMRT (Pacific Biosciences) and bisulfite sequencing. The genome plot shows the distribution of the recognition sequences on both strands of the chromosome and was made by using DNAPlotter.54The Restriction Enzyme Database (REBASE®38) was searched for Synechocystis genes encoding putative DNA methyltransferases. In addition to slr0214, which encodes M.Ssp6803I modifying m5CGATCG,20 the database analysis revealed five further ORFs with significant similarities to characterized methyltransferase genes, which could be responsible for the observed methylation pattern. In particular, these are sll0729 and slr1803, which are present on the chromosome, and slr6050, slr6095 and sll8009 (see Table 1 for an overview on methyltransferase nomenclature and corresponding genes), which are found on the plasmids pSYSX and pSYSG, respectively.3.2. The Synechocystis DNA methyltransferasesAccording to the presence of a Dam and a D12 class N6-adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase domain (COG0338 and pfam02086), the gene sll0729 likely encodes an adenine-specific methyltransferase. However, phylogenetic analyses showed separate clustering of this methyltransferase from characterized adenine-specific methyltransferases of heterotrophic bacteria such as Dam of E. coli (Supplementary Fig. S3). Using the BlastP algorithm32,33 and the NCBI nr database (January 2017), the closest homolog among cyanobacteria was found in the genome of Fischerella sp. JSC-11 (identity of 73%, BlastP e value of 9e-148), and it should be mentioned that 234 other proteins of high similarity exist in cyanobacteria (e-value = 5e-15). The closest homolog beyond cyanobacteria exists in the genome of the archaeon Methanosarcina mazei (identity of 53%, BlastP e value of 9e-112) and the bacterial strain Spirochaetes bacterium GWB_1_27_13 (identity of 60%, BlastP e value of 9e-111), respectively.To study the function of Sll0729, a mutant was generated in which the aphII gene, conferring Km resistance, was inserted into sll0729, leading to the deletion of a BclI-EcoRI fragment containing most of its coding sequence (Fig. 2A). Genotypic analysis revealed that a completely segregated <U+0394>sll0729 mutant was obtained since only the fragment enlarged by the expected size of the inserted aphII gene was amplified by PCR, while a WT-sized fragment was not produced with <U+0394>sll0729 mutant DNA as template (Fig. 2B). SMRT sequencing of the <U+0394>sll0729 mutant revealed a lack of GGm4CC methylation but no other differences compared to the WT DNA methylation status, indicating that sll0729 encodes for a cytosine instead of an adenine-specific methyltransferase. Similarly, bisulfite sequencing showed no methylation of GGCC in the <U+0394>sll0729 mutant, all methylation signals with mutant DNA were below the threshold differentiating valid signals from background and experimental error (Supplementary Figs S2B and C). To verify this observation experimentally, chromosomal DNA from <U+0394>sll0729 mutant cells was incubated with various methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes to evaluate changes in the methylation pattern. Enzymes known to be unable to cut modified GGm4CC motifs, such as HaeIII, EaeI, and ApaI, could cut mutant DNA but not WT DNA (Fig. 2C). This result was supported by over-expression of sll0729 in E. coli. Plasmid DNA from E. coli clones expressing sll0729 were protected against the action of HaeIII (Fig. 2D). Moreover, recombinant Sll0729 protein was purified by affinity chromatography via a fused His-tag and was found to catalyze significant DNA-specific methyltransferase activity in an in vitro enzyme assay (Fig. 4).

(n.c., uncut control DNA; M, DNA size marker <U+03BB>-DNA cut by HindIII and EcoRI). Please note that GGCmC is cleaved by HaeIII, whereas GGmCC is resistant to cleavage (NEB). (D) Restriction analysis of plasmids, which were isolated from cells of the DNA-methylation negative E. coli strain TOP10 over-expressing M.Ssp6803II (Sll0729), using methylation-sensitive enzyme (HaeIII) and HindIII as control. (n.c., uncut control DNA; M, DNA size marker <U+03BB>-DNA cut by HindIII and EcoRI).Altogether, these results indicate that sll0729 encodes a cytosine-specific DNA-methyltransferase responsible for modifying the core sequence 5'-GGm4CC-3'. Thus, following the established nomenclature of REBASE®, this DNA-specific Synechocystis methyltransferase was named M.Ssp6803II (Table 1).The protein sequence of the methyltransferase encoded by slr1803 shows significant sequence similarities to Dam-like enzymes from many heterotrophic bacteria and forms one cluster with these enzymes (Supplementary Fig. S3). Furthermore, protein domain prediction at the NCBI Blast server showed that it also possesses a D12-class N6-adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase domain. The highest sequence similarity was found with the homolog from the cyanobacterium Halothece sp. PCC 7418 (identity of 57%, BlastP e-value of 1e-121). We found 290 highly similar proteins in other cyanobacteria (e-value = 5e-15). In addition, closely related proteins also exist in other Bacteria such as Chloroflexi bacterium RBG_16_57_9 (identity of 58%, BlastP e-value of 5e-124) and in Archaea, such as Methanolobus tindarius DSM2278 (identity of 54%, BlastP e-value of 2e-112). Among biochemically characterized enzymes, M.MboI from Moraxella bovis39 was identified as the closest relative (identity of 41%, BlastP e-value of 9e-63). A closely related enzyme was also reported from the filamentous cyanobacterium Anabaena (Nostoc) sp. PCC 7120.18 These features strongly qualify Slr1803 as a candidate modifier of Gm6ATC methylation motif, making Synechocystis DNA resistant against MboI restriction.To verify the function of this putative N6-adenine methyltransferase, a deletion mutant of slr1803 was generated; in this mutant, the internal HincII fragment of the ORF was replaced by an aphII gene (Fig. 3A). In addition to the mutated fragment, which is enlarged by the expected size of the inserted aphII gene, PCR analysis also detected the WT-sized PCR fragment from <U+0394>slr1803 mutant DNA (Fig. 3B). The non-segregated status of the <U+0394>slr1803 mutant could not be improved by cultivation at higher Km concentrations for many generations. This result indicates that the slr1803 gene is essential for the viability of Synechocystis under our laboratory conditions. Consistent with the non-segregated genotype of the <U+0394>slr1803 mutant, we observed no change in the methylation of the Synechocystis DNA, because MboI, which is Dam-methylation sensitive, did not cut DNA isolated from the mutant (Fig. 3C).

(n.c., uncut control DNA; M, DNA size marker <U+03BB>-DNA cut by HindIII and EcoRI).Since the methylation specificity of Slr1803 could not be verified using the <U+0394>slr1803 mutant, the ORF was overexpressed in E. coli. Small amounts of recombinant protein of the expected size were found in crude extracts and could be isolated via the fused His-tag. Plasmid DNA from E. coli clones expressing slr1803 was protected against the action of MboI (Fig. 3D) but could be still cut with Sau3A, which is not affected by N6-adenine methylation. Purified recombinant Slr1803 protein also showed significant DNA-specific methyltransferase activity in an in vitro enzyme assay (Fig. 4). In vitro methylation activities of M.Ssp6803II and M.Ssp6803III of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Total DNA-specific methyltransferase activities towards non-methylated Micrococcus DNA was estimated with purified recombinant M.Ssp6803II (Sll0729) and M.Ssp6803III (Slr1803) using the NEB4-restriction buffer (C, control; incubation of DNA without added recombinant protein).In vitro methylation activities of M.Ssp6803II and M.Ssp6803III of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Total DNA-specific methyltransferase activities towards non-methylated Micrococcus DNA was estimated with purified recombinant M.Ssp6803II (Sll0729) and M.Ssp6803III (Slr1803) using the NEB4-restriction buffer (C, control; incubation of DNA without added recombinant protein).These results clearly indicate that slr1803 encodes an N6-adenine-specific DNA methyltransferase modifying the core sequence 5'-Gm6ATC-3'. Thus, this Synechocystis DNA-specific methyltransferase was named M.Ssp6803III (Table 1).The methylome of Synechocystis includes two additional methylation motifs, GAm6AGGC and GGm6AN7TTGG/CCAm6AN7TCC that are not modified by the methyltransferases encoded on the chromosome. BlastP searches using proteins encoded on the Synechocystis plasmids revealed three additional genes for putative DNA-specific methyltransferases.On the pSYSX plasmid, we found slr6050 annotated to encode a hypothetical protein of 1100 amino acids. BlastP searches revealed that very similar proteins exist in many different bacteria but only in four other cyanobacteria (Microcystis aeruginosa spp. PCC 9701 and 9806, Synechococcus sp. PCC 73109, and Prochlorothrix hollandica). To verify the function of this putative N6-adenine methyltransferase, a deletion mutant of slr6050 was generated; in this mutant, the internal ClaI fragment of the ORF was replaced by an aphII gene (Fig. 5A). Since the deleted slr6050 fragment had approximately the same size as the inserted aphII gene, the PCR reaction using flanking primers (slr6050fw and slr6050rev, Supplementary Table S2) did not allow to judge whether or not the mutant was fully segregated. Alternatively, we used a primer pair (slr6050_i_fw and slr6050_i_rev, Supplementary Table S2), which binds to sequences located inside the deleted ClaI fragment. This PCR-detected DNA of same size using DNA from WT as well as the slr6050 mutant (Fig. 5B), which clearly indicated that the mutant was not fully segregated. The aphII gene was detected with primers aphII_fw and aphII_rev only with DNA of the mutant (Fig. 5C). The non-segregated status of the <U+0394>slr6050 mutant could not be improved by cultivation at higher Km concentrations for many generations. This result indicates that the slr6050 gene is essential for the viability of Synechocystis under our laboratory conditions. Mutation of plasmid-located methyltransferase genes.

Eco57I is sensitive to the methylation of CTGAm6AG or CTTCm6AG40 making Slr6050 a likely candidate for the modification of GAm6AGGC, which was detected by SMRT sequencing of Synechocystis DNA (Fig. 1). Unfortunately, all our attempts to obtain recombinant Slr6050 protein after expression of a codon-optimized slr6050 gene in E. coli failed; hence, we could not directly verify its function as DNA-specific methyltransferase and the proposed specificity.Therefore, we only tentatively annotate this putative DNA-specific methyltransferase to be responsible for the modification of GAm6AGGC site of Synechocystis and name it M.Ssp6803IV (Table 1).Another methyltransferase candidate was found on plasmid pSYSX (slr6095), which shows similarities to DNA-specific methyltransferases of type I RM systems. Thus, this enzyme could be responsible for the modification of the remaining motif GGm6AN7TTGG/CCAm6AN7TCC. BlastP searches against the NCBI database revealed that 487 highly similar proteins are harboured in other cyanobacteria (e-value =5e-15). To study the function of Slr6095, a mutant was generated in which the aphII gene, conferring Km resistance, was inserted into the coding sequence of slr6095 at the single AccIII site (Fig. 5D). Genotypic analysis revealed that a completely segregated <U+0394>slr6095 mutant was obtained since only the fragment enlarged by the expected size of the inserted aphII gene was amplified by PCR, while a WT-sized fragment was not produced with <U+0394>slr6095 mutant DNA as template (Fig. 5E). SMRT sequencing of the <U+0394>slr6095 mutant revealed a lack of GGm6AN7TTGG/CCAm6AN7TCC methylation but no other differences compared to the WT DNA methylation status, indicating that slr6095 encodes the corresponding type I adenine-specific methyltransferase. Accordingly, this putative DNA-specific methyltransferase of Synechocystis was named M.Ssp6803V (Table 1).Finally, the genes sll8009 (M subunit), ssl8010, sll8006 (S subunit), and sll8049 (R subunit) on the pSYSG plasmid are annotated in CyanoBase41 to encode all subunits required for a complete RM system. Similar proteins are encoded in about 50 other cyanobacterial genomes. However, after protein sequence comparisons we noticed that sll8009 appears to encode a methyltransferase that is N-terminally truncated by 156 amino acid residues. The missing sequence is present in ssl8010 and the sequence between ssl8010 and sll8009. Because both genes are in the same reading frame, a point mutation leading to a TAA stop codon might have led to its inactivation, consistent with a frameshift mutation in sll8049. The entire region comprising sll8009 and ssl8010 was amplified and re-sequenced. This analysis confirmed the DNA sequence displayed in CyanoBase41 and the truncated nature of Sll8009. Nevertheless, to study the function of the putative methyltransferase Sll8009, a mutant was generated in which the aphII gene, conferring Km resistance, was inserted into a deletion of an internal NheI fragment of the coding sequence of sll8009 (Fig. 5F). Genotypic analysis revealed that a completely segregated <U+0394>sll8009 mutant was obtained since only the fragment enlarged by the expected size of the inserted aphII gene was amplified by PCR, while a WT-sized fragment was not produced with <U+0394>sll8009 mutant DNA as template (Fig. 5G). However, SMRT sequencing of the <U+0394>sll8009 mutant revealed no differences compared to the WT DNA methylation status, indicating that sll8009 is not involved in the methylation of Synechocystis DNA, because it most likely encodes an enzymatically non-active methyltransferase.3.3. Physiological characterization of mutants defective in DNA methyltransferasesTo gain insight into possible physiological functions of DNA methylation in Synechocystis, mutants defective in these methyltransferase-encoding genes were studied. No clear phenotypical alterations, in comparison to WT, were observed for the <U+0394>slr0214, <U+0394>slr6095 and the partially segregated <U+0394>slr1803 and <U+0394>slr6050 mutants. Because completely segregated <U+0394>slr1803 and <U+0394>slr6050 mutants could not be obtained (Figs 3B and 5), M.Ssp6803III and M.Ssp6803IV play essential roles for cell viability. Interestingly, cultivation under identical conditions indicated a very severe growth deficiency of mutant <U+0394>sll0729, whereas the mutant <U+0394>slr0214 grew like WT under these conditions. Moreover, a bluish appearance due to changed pigment composition was characteristic for this mutant compared to WT and mutant <U+0394>slr0214 over the entire cultivation time (Fig. 6). Whole-cell absorbance spectra clearly indicated that the <U+0394>sll0729 cells contained a reduced amount of chlorophyll a (represented by the peaks at 440 and 680 nm), while the content of phycocyanin (represented by the peak at 630 nm) was not changed (Fig. 6C). The decreased chlorophyll content most probably reflects reduced photosynthetic capacity, which corresponds to the diminished growth of mutant <U+0394>sll0729.Phenotype profiling of mutants <U+0394>slr0214 and <U+0394>sll0729 defective in M.Ssp6803I and M.Ssp6803II. (A) Growth curves of the WT and the mutants <U+0394>slr0214 and <U+0394>sll0729. (B) Phenotypic appearance of liquid cultures. (C) Whole cell absorbance spectra of the WT and the mutant <U+0394>sll0729.Phenotype profiling of mutants <U+0394>slr0214 and <U+0394>sll0729 defective in M.Ssp6803I and M.Ssp6803II. (A) Growth curves of the WT and the mutants <U+0394>slr0214 and <U+0394>sll0729. (B) Phenotypic appearance of liquid cultures. (C) Whole cell absorbance spectra of the WT and the mutant <U+0394>sll0729.According to transcriptomic data available for Synechocystis,42 the sll0729 gene potentially comprises an operon with two adjacent genes (Fig. 2A), the upstream located sll0728 (accA) gene encoding the acetyl-CoA carboxylase alpha subunit and the downstream-located ssl1378 gene encoding a small hypothetical protein. To rule out polar effects on the expression of the downstream gene, we generated complementation strains in which sll0729 or ssl1378 were ectopically expressed. The expression of intact sll0729 fully reversed the phenotype back to WT-like growth and pigmentation (Supplementary Fig. S4), whereas <U+0394>sll0729 mutant cells expressing ssl1378 did not change the phenotype compared to the original <U+0394>sll0729 mutant. These experiments clearly show that defects in the DNA-specific methyltransferase M.Ssp6803II encoded by sll0729 result in strong physiological defects; hence, this enzyme seems to play an important role in Synechocystis.4. DiscussionSynechocystis possesses at least five different methylation activities toward specific DNA sequences, which were detected using SMRT and bisulfite sequencing. The three DNA methyltransferases encoded on the chromosome seem to belong to the type II methyltransferase group since they modify bases in short palindromic sequences (M.Ssp6803I-III), whereas M.Ssp6803V is a type I enzyme that modifies a larger bi-partite motif (see Fig. 1). The M.Ssp6803IV is not modifying a palindromic sequence and, based on its similarity to Eco571 RM enzymes, qualifies as a type IV enzyme.40 The occurrence of five methylated motifs and five methyltransferase-encoding genes is similar to other bacteria. A recent study of the epigenetic landscape of prokaryotes revealed that only a few genomes are not methylated, whereas others contain multiple different motifs, up to 19.16 This study included the cyanobacteria Leptolyngbya sp. PCC 6406 and Mastigocladopsis repens PCC 10914, with 12 and 2 modified motifs, respectively. A survey of palindromic sequences and their putative modifying methyltransferases identified several types among cyanobacteria.43 Particularly widespread among cyanobacteria are the palindromic sequences GCGATCGC (highly iterated palindrome 1, HIP1),44,45 GGCC, and GATC. These three sequences contain the motifs for the DNA methyltransferases M.Ssp6803I-III, which are encoded on the chromosome of Synechocystis (this work and [20]), as well as related enzymes in Anabaena (Nostoc) sp. PCC 7120.43 It is very likely that the proteins of high similarities encoded in many other cyanobacterial genomes show identical methylation specificities.The previously identified C5-cytosine-specific enzyme M.Ssp6803I modifies the core motif within the HIP1 sequences.20 Despite the frequent occurrence of methylated HIP1 sequences, their methylation by M.Ssp6803I seems to have no significant impact on the physiology of Synechocystis under laboratory conditions, because in previous work only slight growth retardation was observed for the corresponding Synechocystis mutant20 and the mutant defective in the ortholog of Anabaena (Nostoc) sp. PCC 7120.18 Similarly, the expression of the gene for M.Ssp6803I in tobacco chloroplasts led to the methylation of the plastome DNA, but the transplastomic lines showed no alterations in plastid gene expression and were phenotypically indistinguishable from wild-type plants.46 The minor effects of the mutation of the gene for M.Ssp6803I on cell viability and gene expression contrast its widespread occurrence among cyanobacteria. However, the close correlation between the presence of this methyltransferase and the occurrence of HIP1 sequences has led to a model wherein M.Ssp6803I could be involved in the methylation-directed mismatch repair of DNA, which is potentially of high importance for cyanobacteria exposed to strong light intensities, including UV.43The enzyme M.Ssp6803III modifies adenine in the sequence 5'-GATC-3', which is an internal part of the HIP1 sequence but often also occurs separately. Correspondingly, genes for methyltransferases modifying Gm5CGATCGC and Gm6ATC are usually co-occurring in the genomes of cyanobacteria.43 The activity of the Dam-like enzyme M.ssp6803III was clearly proven by the inhibition of MboI cleavage in E. coli cells expressing this Synechocystis gene. Its activity is also sufficiently high to modify virtually all GATC sites in the Synechocystis DNA, which is completely resistant against MboI treatments. Similar results were obtained when slr1803 was expressed in tobacco plastids.46 The M.Ssp6803III (Slr1803) appears homologous to related Dam-like enzymes from many bacteria (Supplementary Fig. S3). It is well known that Dam methylation has many physiological functions such as in the initiation of DNA replication, nucleoid segregation, post-replicative DNA mismatch repair, and gene expression regulation.9,47 The Dam-like protein M.Ssp6803III plays an essential role in Synechocystis since our attempts to generate a null mutant were not successful and led only to a partial gene replacement. Similar results were reported for the ortholog in Anabaena (Nostoc) sp. PCC 7120.18 In contrast, dam mutants were obtained for E. coli that remained viable under standard conditions but showed an increased mutation rate (reviewed in [47]), whereas Dam methylation is essential for viability in Vibrio cholerae.48 The different dependence of these bacteria on Dam could be explained by differences in the mode of chromosomal replication. In chromosome II of V. cholera, the origin for DNA replication (oriC) is different from that of E. coli. It replicates in a DnaA-independent manner but was found to strictly depend on the methylation by Dam.48–50 The molecular details of DNA replication in Synechocystis are less well understood, but it has been shown that DnaA is not essential for the initiation of DNA replication.51,52 Thus, it might be possible that the Dam-dependent DNA methylation is essential for the mode of DNA replication in Synechocystis similar to the case of V. cholerae.The DNA-methyltransferase M.Ssp6803II modifies the HaeIII recognition sequence 5'-GGCC-3'. Its recognition site was verified by screening HaeIII-resistant plasmids in a Synechocystis gene library, by mutation and overexpression of the ORF sll0729. Moreover, bisulfite sequencing revealed that M.Ssp6803II is specific for N4-cytosine leading to 5'-GGm4CC-3' and modifies at least 90% of the recognition sequence. However, the protein shows structural features that are different from the well-conserved C5-cytosine-specific DNA methyltransferases, including M.HaeIII. Instead of cytosine-specific enzymes, the most similar proteins all belong to the group of N6-adenine-specific DNA methyltransferases, which is documented by the phylogenetic analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3). Structural and sequence comparisons of cytosine- and adenine-specific enzymes revealed that most of the conserved motifs are shared by both enzyme classes, only the organization of these conserved motifs and minor sequence differences within seem to determine whether an enzyme is specific for cytosine or adenine.53 Correspondingly, a sequence alignment of M.Ssp6803II with several previously characterized Dam-like sequences revealed distinct sequence differences between the cytosine-specific and the adenine-specific enzymes (Supplementary Fig. S5).The DmtB enzyme in Anabaena (Nostoc) sp. PCC 7120 shows similar functional and structural features to M.Ssp6803II, which included the N4-methylation of the first cytosine leading to the inhibition of HaeIII restriction activity.18 The deletion of M.Ssp6803II (<U+0394>sll0729 mutant) led to a strong phenotype and the mutant could only be maintained at conditions permitting slow growth. Hence, the modification of the HaeIII recognition sequence is important for the performance of Synechocystis under conditions promoting high growth rates. However, further experiments are needed to identify the primary cause of this strong phenotypic alteration. We hypothesize that the absence of GGCC methylation could either have a broad impact on gene expression or the coordination of DNA replication with cell propagation.Moreover, we analyzed three additional DNA methyltransferases in Synechocystis, two of which modify sequence motifs that have not been previously detected among cyanobacteria. Albeit lacking genetic and biochemical evidence, we conclude that M.Ssp6803IV, which is encoded by the slr6050 gene on the plasmid pSYSX, is likely responsible for the modification of GAm6AGGC motifs. This assumption is supported by the REBASE database since a search using this recognition sequence revealed the Slr6050 protein as M.Ssp6803IV and by its similarity to Eco57I with a closely related recognition sequence CTGA m6AG.40 Moreover, it is also supported by the elimination of other possible candidate enzymes, since with M.Ssp6803V we identified the enzyme modifying the only remaining, bipartite motif GGAN7TTGG/CCAAN7TCC. M.Ssp6803V is encoded by the slr6095 gene on plasmid pSYSX. It is annotated as part of a type I RM system.41 Nevertheless, the restriction system appears not to be active in Synechocystis, since we obtained a mutant lacking the respective methylation. Furthermore, we characterized the sll8009 gene, which is also annotated to encode a methyltransferase of a type I RM system.41 However, a closer inspection of this DNA locus indicated that the gene encodes a truncated, inactive protein. Correspondingly, the mutation of sll8009 has no impact on DNA methylation of Synechocystis. Taking this into account, M.Ssp6803IV is the only remaining DNA methyltransferase for GAm6AGGC modification.Altogether, this study provides the first comprehensive methylome analysis of the cyanobacterial model strain Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Moreover, it can be regarded as the groundwork for systematic analyses of the possible impact and molecular mechanisms linking methyltransferase activities and particular phenotypes in cyanobacteria. Particularly, the detected ~10% unmethylated CGATCG and GGCC sites in the bisulfite sequencing analyses constitute a solid basis for further detailed analyses of their functional relevance.We thank Richard J.

IntroductionNext-generation sequencing provides whole genome analysis of structural variants as well as sequence variants.1,2 The technique has made a significant contribution to cancer genomics and to the analysis of human cancer cell lines that have been accumulated in the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia3 and the Catalogue of Somatic Mutations in Cancer.4 It is noted that clinical tumour samples are often contaminated with normal cells and show heterogeneity due to clonal evolution5,6 which is also observed in tumour cell lines.7 These two features present problems in sequencing tumour samples. Although recent advances in single cell analysis can distinguish differences between cells and help to uncover genetic heterogeneity in tumour cells,8 the investigation of allelic differences remains challenging.Chromosomes can be distinguished in fluid suspensions using a bivariate fluorescence-activated cell sorter which separates them by size and base pair ratio and displays the results in the form of a flow karyotype,9 allowing accurate estimation of chromosome size and GC content.10,11 The procedure enables the isolation and collection not only of aberrant chromosomes but sometimes also of normal homologues that contain measurable differences in repetitive DNA.12 Analysis of sorted chromosomes can characterize cryptic allelic variants occurring in a reciprocal chromosome translocation.13 Sorted chromosome samples have been extensively exploited in diagnostic cytogenetics and in the production of chromosome-specific DNA for chromosome painting14,15 and chromosome sequencing.16,17 The latter serves to focus on regions of interest and has application in refining genome analysis and assisting genome assembly.In this study, chromosome-specific sequencing reveals the breakpoint junction and identifies a novel fusion gene in a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 14 observed in a human cancer cell line. The sequence analysis of homologous regions on chromosomes separated by flow sorting has enabled alleles at several loci to be distinguished by their nucleotide differences.2. Materials and methods2.1. Cell lines and DNA preparationThe Ishikawa 3-H-12 cell line registered as JCRB1505 was established from an endometrial cancer.18 Cells were cultured using MEM with 15% non-heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum. Genomic DNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen). The karyotypes and SNP array profiles are available from our previous study (Supplementary Fig. S1A).7 Because t(9; 14) was detected in all the metaphases examined and therefore expected to be a reference marker for this cell line, this study was focused on der(9).2.2. Chromosome preparation and stainingMitotic cells were collected by shake-off from three 175-cm2 flasks at passage 25* after colcemid treatment (KaryoMAX Colcemid, Gibco) at a final concentration of 0.1 µg/ml for 5 h. Cells were centrifuged at 250 g for 8 min in 50 ml tubes. The supernatant was discarded and replaced by 10 ml of hypotonic solution (75 mM KCl, 0.2 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine, 10 mM MgSO4·7H2O, pH 8.0) and incubated at RT for 15 min. After centrifugation, the cell pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of ice-cold polyamine buffer (2 mM EDTA, 0.5 mM EGTA, 80 mM KCl, 0.25% Triton X-100, 0.2 mM spermine, 0.5 mM spermidine, 20 mM NaCl, pH 7.2) and incubated on ice for 10 min. The suspension was then vortexed vigorously for 12 s and the chromosomes were stained by 5 µg/ml of Hoechst 33258 (Sigma-Aldrich, B2883), 40 µg/ml of Chromomycin A3 (Sigma-Aldrich, C2659), and 10 mM MgSO4. 10 mM sodium citrate and 25 mM sodium sulphite were added 1 h before flow sorting.2.3. Chromosome sortingFlow cytometric analysis was carried out at the Cambridge Resource Centre for Comparative Genomics. Stained chromosome suspensions were analysed on a flow cytometer (MoFlo, Beckman Coulter, Fullerton, CA, USA) equipped with two water-cooled lasers (Spectra-Physics Model 2020) spatially separated at the flow chamber. The first laser was tuned to emit multiline UV (330–360 nm) which excites Hoechst 33258. The second laser was tuned to emit light at 457 nm to excite Chromomycin A3. The power of both lasers was set to 300 mW and kept constant using light control feedback. Fluorescence emitted from Hoechst 33258 was collected using a 400 nm long pass filter combined with a 480 nm short pass filter. Chromomycin A3 fluorescence was collected using a 490 nm long pass filter. The instrument was configured for two-way sorting with high speed sorting at a data rate of 8,000–12,000 events per second with the optimal setting of the sheath pressure to ~ 60 psi and the drop drive frequency to ~ 95 kHz using a 70 µm cytonozzle tip. The flow karyotype was displayed by Hoechst 33258 versus Chromomycin A3 fluorescence and acquired by a total of 50,000–100,000 events at a rate of 1,000 events per second. Data collected from the experiments were analysed using Summit Software Version 4.1 (Beckman Coulter). Approximately 2,000 chromosomes were flow sorted into a 0.5-ml UV-treated PCR tube from each chromosome peak.2.4. Chromosome sequencingFor chromosome-specific sequencing, chromosomes were amplified by the REPLI-g single cell kit (Qiagen) and a genomic DNA fragment library was prepared using the Ion Xpress Plus Fragment Library kit (Life Technologies). Emulsion PCR of the library was performed by the Ion One Touch 2 system using the Ion PGM Template OT2 400 kit (Life Technologies). Sequencing was carried out by the Ion PGM sequencer using the Ion PGM Sequencing 400 kit and the Ion 318 Chip (Life Technologies). All protocols followed the manufacturer’s instructions. Alignment of sequencing reads with the human genome reference (GRCh37/hg19) was performed using the Torrent Suite v4.1.2 software. The bam file was mapped to the hg19 reference using the TMAP software v5.0.13 with standard options (Supplementary Table S1). This was visualized in the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) using the mapping quality value as 1. BLAT search in the UCSC Genome tools was used to find similarity of sequence reads in the genome database.2.5. Fusion point analysisThe breakpoint junction was amplified by PCR at an annealing temperature of 65°C using the following primer pairs designed using the Primer3 software; der9-BPf: GGAAGGCTCAGACAGAGAGG and der9-BPr: CTCTCCCTTGCACTCAGCTC. Total RNA was prepared using the AllPrep DNA/RNA Mini Kit (Qiagen) and treated with DNaseI. Reverse transcription of RNA into cDNA was performed using the PrimeScript RT-PCR Kit (Takara) with random hexamers. Amplification of the WASH1–NPAS3 fusion transcript was performed with annealing temperature at 63°C using the PCR primer pair of WASH1f: GGAAGGCTCAGACAGAGAGG and NPAS3r: AGCATCTCGGGATTTCTCCT.2.6. Variant analysisMultiplex primer pools for eight genes at 9p24.3, 10 genes at 14q13 and the breakpoint boundary region at 14q13.1 were obtained using the Ion AmpliSeq Designer and are listed in Supplementary Table S2. The Ampliseq custom panels for 9p24.3 and 14q13 consist of 118 and 120 amplicons, covering 33,607 and 33,275 bp in total size, respectively. Sequence library and template preparations were performed using the Ion AmpliSeq Kit for Chef DL8 and Ion PGM Hi-Q Chef Kit (Life Technologies), respectively. Sequencing was run on the Ion PGM using the Ion 316 chip. The analysis was carried out using the Variant Caller plug-in in the Torrent Suit and the parameters are given in Supplementary Table S3.3. Results3.1. Flow karyotypeThe flow karyotype of the Ishikawa 3-H-12 cell line at passage 25* is shown in Fig. 1, indicating the peaks resulting from chromosome 9, one of two chromosomes 14 (14S) and der(9). Based on array data, the chromosome size of der(9) is estimated to be ~ 215 Mb. It is contained in an abnormal peak, close to the normal chromosome 3 peak, and weaker than the other normal peaks because it contains only half the number of chromosomes, i.e. only the derivative chromosome rather than the pairs of homologues present in other peaks. Chromosome 14 is heteromorphic and this allows the separation of one of the two chromosome 14 homologues by sorting. In this study, the sorted chromosome 14 is referred to as 14S, and the other unsorted homologue is referred to as 14U. Flow karyotype of the Ishikawa 3-H-12 cell line at P25* without removing the background manually by image processing was obtained after sorting a larger number of chromosomes than usual to show clearly the der(9) peak close to the normal chromosome 3 peak. The der(9) peak is weaker than other peaks that have pairs of normal chromosomes as it exists in only one copy in each cell. Normal chromosome 9 and one of the chromosome 14 homologues, 14S, are also selected for sorting.Flow karyotype of the Ishikawa 3-H-12 cell line at P25* without removing the background manually by image processing was obtained after sorting a larger number of chromosomes than usual to show clearly the der(9) peak close to the normal chromosome 3 peak.

Sequence analysis of der(9) and characterization of the fusion breakpointIn order to identify the genomic breakpoint junction in der(9), two sequence libraries were prepared from amplification of the sorted der(9) chromosomes. The sequence data from these two runs show 1.7 and 1.0Gb consisting of 6.4 and 4.0 M reads with the read length modes of 372 and 416 bp, respectively (Supplementary Table S4). Coverage analysis based on the human reference genome revealed that most sequence reads map to chromosomes 9 and 14, with some on chromosome 3 (Fig. 2) corresponding to a small amount of contamination during chromosome sorting due to the close proximity of the der(9) and chromosome 3 peaks. Although a small number of reads were not aligned to the reference, more than 99% of the reads were aligned with 95 or 96% identities of base pairs (Supplementary Table S4). This indicates that some reads are partially aligned with soft-clipped sequences, corresponding to breakpoint regions. Mapping data were displayed in the IGV software focusing on the distal end of the 9p region (Supplementary Fig. S2). Three reads measuring 242, 356 and 400 bp including unmapped sequences prove to be fragments that cover the fusion point. These three sequences were subjected to a BLAT search, which show homologies to both chromosomes 9 and 14 (Supplementary Fig. S2). The fragments localize to the second introns of both the WASH1 (9p24.3) and NPAS3 (14q13.1) genes (Fig. 3A). Absence of sequence homology between chromosomes 9 and 14 at the breakpoints indicates non-homologous end joining. The junction was amplified by PCR on genomic DNA using primers from chromosomes 9 and 14. A fusion transcript is formed as expected based on the orientation of two genes. RT-PCR followed by sequencing confirms the in-frame fusion of WASH1 exon 2 and NPAS3 exon 3 (Fig. 3B). WASH1 is located at the distal end of the short arm of chromosome 9, ~ 22 kb from the telomere according to the genome database. As the SNP microarray reported in our previous study7 does not have markers located at the distal end, this rearrangement could not be characterized. The chromosome sequence data and the breakpoint sequence are deposited in DRA/DDBJ (accession number: DRA006485 and LC331302). Reference coverage charts from chromosome sequencing of der(9) are shown based on average base read depth. (A) Coverage on each chromosome indicates its contents aligned to chromosomes 9 and 14, with some sequences mapped to chromosome 3 because of contamination from the closely located peak in the flow karyotype. (B) Sequence reads are detected along chromosome 9, with a large gap at the region of the centromere and pericentromeric heterochromatin. (C) The majority of reads appear in the 14q13-qter region, which indicates the breakpoint at 14q13.1 shown by an arrowhead.Reference coverage charts from chromosome sequencing of der(9) are shown based on average base read depth.

Variant profiles in the neighbourhood genes of the breakpointAmplicon sequencing on total genomic DNA reveals that 117 and 118 target regions in 9p24 and 14q13, respectively, close to the breakpoint are amplified with at least 200 reads. As three amplicons in the 14q13 region have less than 30 reads, these targets are excluded from the data analysis. The average number of reads per amplicon is calculated to be 2,198 and 1,982 for 9p24 and 14q13 regions, respectively.Nucleotide variants in the total genomic DNA sample are detected at 37 positions in the 9p24.3 region, but five positions were of low quality. The remaining 32 positions which did not include missense mutations serve as informative markers for distinguishing between alleles at variant loci. According to their frequency in the sequence reads, each variant allele can be classified into two types, around 50 or nearly 100% of reads. This suggests that two alleles are present in this region, supported by our previous data based on the SNP microarray and M-FISH which showed two chromosome copies (Supplementary Fig. S3A).7 Of the 32 sequence variants, 16 were detected at 100% frequency, reflecting their presence in both chromosomes (Table 1). The other 16 variants with a frequency of around 50% indicate their presence in one of the two chromosomes, but these could not be localized to a chromosome in the genomic DNA sample. Chromosome-specific sequencing on der(9) and normal chromosome 9 reveal that allelic variants were detected at 23 and 25 positions, respectively, all of which showed nearly 100% frequency. This demonstrates that seven and nine variants are specific for der(9) and the normal chromosome 9, respectively, i.e., one allele at each locus. Because the other nine positions are not amplified in sorted chromosome samples, the alleles at these positions could not be distinguished.

The allele frequencies at these positions show three classes; either around 33 or 66, or nearly 100% of reads, corresponding to the presence of variants in one of three, two of three or all three alleles at these positions, respectively. This suggests that this region in 14q13 is present in three copies, which agrees with the SNP microarray profile and the karyotype analysis that reveal three copies of chromosome 14 (Supplementary Fig. S1).7 The common variants present in all three alleles with 100% frequency are detected at six positions. The remaining 23 and 7 variants could be detected by frequencies of 33 and 66%, corresponding to their presence in one and two chromosomes, respectively. Chromosome sequencing was run twice in each sample and showed that variant frequencies were all nearly 100% (Supplementary Table S5). By sorting 14S separately from the unsorted chromosome 14 (14U), variant frequencies in 14S are either 0 or 100% (Table 2), indicating successful chromosome sorting without contamination between homologues. This demonstrates that der(9) and 14S samples have 13 and 29 variants, respectively (Table 2). Of these, 23 variants are specific for 14S. The total DNA sample indicates the presence of variants in 7 loci in two of three chromosomes, but they are only detected in der(9) and absent in 14S (Table 2). This implies that these variants must be shared between the chromosome 14 homologous region on der(9) and 14U, indicating that the chromosome 14 region in der(9) represents a duplication of 14U. Among the variants in the 10 genes, five missense mutations are identified (Supplementary Table S5). One of them is known to be a polymorphism, localized to der(9) and 14U. The other four mutations involving three different gene loci are included in 14S (Supplementary Table S5).

Copy number changes at the 14q13 region during passageThe SNP microarray performed in our previous study shows differences of the Ishikawa 3-H-12 genome profiles between low and high passages.7 Although the der(9) has already been found in all cells at low passage, the enlarged profiles focused on the breakpoint region at 14q13.1 indicate copy number changes occurring in one locus at P3 and three loci at P20 (Supplementary Fig. S3B). The change observed at both P3 and P20 corresponds to the breakpoint that forms der(9). The additional changes at P20 between the other two loci involve breakpoints that cause a decrease in copy number. Because this is not detected at P3, the cryptic deletion must have arisen in the cell population after long-term culture. Amplicon sequencing targeted for the 10 kb region around the breakpoint revealed that the whole region is amplified in 14S (Supplementary Fig. S4). As the region upstream of the der(9) breakpoint is absent in der(9), only the downstream region is amplified. Similar profiles of the downstream region shared by 14S and der(9) suggest that no additional chromosome rearrangement has occurred in the region. The patterns of variant frequencies across this region in the total genomic DNA sample demonstrates the change from 50 to 33/66/100% at P3 and from 100 to 50/100% at P20 (Supplementary Table S6), corresponding to the chromosome copy number changes from 2 to 3 and from 1 to 2 that have occurred in this region (Fig. 4). Variants detected in the der(9) would be expected to be present at P3, indicating that three of them, 66% at P3, are shared with 14U. However, these variants are not detected in total genomic DNA at P20. This implies that two additional breaks have occurred in 14U and led to a cryptic deletion. Because the other variants detected in one of three loci at P3 are specific for der(9), these changes can be related to the breakpoint event that occurred following duplication of chromosome 14. Genome structure at the 14q13.1 region is illustrated from the array profiles and combined with variant frequencies obtained from amplicon sequencing, with comparisons between passages, P3 (A) and P20 (B). The breakpoint in the der(9) is located at the position 33,583,729 bp. Variants are assigned to der(9) and 14S by amplicon sequencing in the chromosome-specific DNA. The frequencies are distinguished by four different symbols. Variant assignments on chromosome homologues at P3 are estimated from the P20 profile. A series of 100, 50 and 33/66% in total genomic DNA correspond to 1, 2 and 3 copies, respectively. Frequencies at three positions with 66% at low passage change to 50% at high passage, suggesting the presence of these variants in the 14U deletion indicated by a dashed line. gDNA: total genomic DNA.Genome structure at the 14q13.1 region is illustrated from the array profiles and combined with variant frequencies obtained from amplicon sequencing, with comparisons between passages, P3 (A) and P20 (B).

DiscussionChromosome translocation is a common feature of chromosome rearrangements in tumour cells and can lead to the formation of a fusion gene.19,20 Although fusion genes are found by RNA-seq, it is hard to identify the genomic breakpoint because normal and abnormal alleles usually coexist in total genomic DNA samples and cannot be distinguished by conventional analysis.21 The human genome size is 3,099 Mbp according to the golden path length of the GRCh37.p13 assembly. As the majority of the Ishikawa karyotypes are 45, X, -X and have some gains,7 the size of each Ishikawa nuclear DNA is estimated to be ~ 6,200 Mbp, including one copy of the der(9). When the breakpoint junction is identified by conventional whole genome sequencing using total genomic DNA, theoretically it can appear in 1 per 15,500,000 fragments based on a 400 bp sequencing sample. However, it can be increased to 1 per 500,000 fragments when the sample is from the sorted der(9) chromosome, that is more efficient than whole genome sequencing. It is reported that alignment of single-end long reads is straightforward to identify fusion junctions.22 We demonstrate that identification of genomic breakpoints detected by conventional karyotypes can be achieved by mapping analysis of single end reads on 400 bp scale without de novo assembly. Although considerable efforts involving conventional cloning techniques have been devoted to uncover breakpoint junctions in tumour genomes,23, chromosome sequencing helps the detection and analysis of the genomic breakpoint junction.Fusion genes serve as genetic markers and can be associated with disease phenotypes.24 Sequence analysis of the der(9) chromosome-specific DNA isolated by flow sorting in our study reveals a WASH1–NPAS3 fusion gene at the translocation breakpoint. This chimeric gene is formed mostly by the NPAS3 component, suggesting that altered NPAS3 expression may be oncogenic. Although no report has shown fusion genes between these two genes, NPAS3 is a transcription factor of a basic helix–loop–helix Per-ARNT-Sim domain family associated with tumour development in multiple forms of cancer.25 Also, it is reported that NPAS3 acts as a tumour suppressor in human malignant astrocytomas.26 The fusion detected by the genomic breakpoint junction and confirmed by the transcript can be a definitive marker for the Ishikawa cell line and used, possibly, for future studies on endometrial carcinoma.Amplicon sequencing of the genes neighbouring the breakpoint demonstrates that variant frequencies in the total genomic DNA are linked to chromosome copy number. Variant frequencies of 50% of reads detected in chromosome 9 indicate the presence of the variant in one of two homologues. The variant frequencies of 33 or 66% of reads in chromosome 14 reflect one or two of three homologues, respectively (Fig. 4). This suggests that a series of patterns consisting of frequencies of approximate 50/100 or 33/66/100% are strongly correlated to the presence of copy numbers of two or three chromosomes, respectively. While the fusion can be clearly distinguished at the chromosome level, sequence variants cannot be regarded as allelic unless the chromosomes are sequenced separately. When amplicon sequencing is performed on chromosome-specific DNA, the variant frequencies of 0 or 100% of reads indicate that the variant is either absent or present in an amplicon. This permits chromosome assignment of each variant to a specific chromosome and enables distinction between homologues. Two chromosomes sharing the same allelic profile suggest that they have a common origin and are formed by duplication. Allele frequencies of ~ 66% of reads reflects the presence of the same variant in two of the three alleles in three chromosomes corresponding to one in der(9) and one in 14U (Table 2, Fig. 5). Further analysis of the breakpoint by amplicon sequencing of the 10 kb region that encompasses the junction in the second intron of NPAS3 identified a cryptic deletion occurring in the chromosome 14 allele shared with der(9). These detailed variant analyses elucidate the process of chromosome rearrangements involving chromosomes 9 and 14. SNP allele peaks show two different allelic profiles of chromosome 14 in Ishikawa cells,7 indicating that the duplication of 14q13–ter has occurred prior to the formation of der(9). Although the variant frequency at 14q13 reveals that the cryptic deletion and the breakpoint in the der(9) occur in different chromosome 14 homologues, these two chromosomes must have been formed through duplication because of their otherwise identical allelic profiles. As the deletion cannot be identified in the array profile at low passage, it must have occurred after the formation of der(9) and during cell culture. These two rearrangements have occurred independently, possibly suggesting a tendency to breakage in the region. The process of chromosome rearrangement involved in chromosome 14. Chromosomes 9 and 14 regions are marked by green and blue, respectively, and the two homologues of chromosome 14 are distinguished by vertical and horizontal patterns. Because chromosome 14 consists of two different allele contents in the SNP array, it must have originated from a normal pair with different allele profiles. Variant analysis in the sorted chromosome samples show that 14S and der(9) have different chromosome 14 allelic profiles, but der(9) and 14U have the same chromosome 14 allelic profiles. This indicates that the origin of der(9) was associated with duplication of 14U. One of the homologues, 14S, does not have detectable changes at chromosomal level and der(9) remains unchanged during cell culture. However, duplication of the long arm of 14U is fused with 9p to form der(9). The 14U chromosome at passage P20 has a cryptic deletion in the same region as the breakpoint in der(9).

In one study in dogs (2n = 78), although there are many acrocentric chromosomes of similar size and seven peaks in the flow karyotype that contain 2 chromosome pairs,29 each dog chromosome was successfully isolated, some by single chromosome sorting; a complete set of painting probes was produced with each probe specific for a single type of dog chromosome.30 Another study demonstrated that chicken microchromosomes can be characterized by single chromosome sorting.31 Single chromosome sorting has been applied more recently to haplotyping normal human chromosome 19, by demonstrating allele heterozygosity.32 When derivative chromosomes are different in size from the normal homologues, they form a unique peak in the flow karyotype and can be resolved easily and collected by flow sorting.33 We show here the isolation of chromosome homologues in a tumour cell line by chromosome sorting that allows homologue-specific sequencing, chromosome assignment of allelic variants and improved characterization of abnormal chromosomes.Authors would like to thank Dr. Ryoka Miki (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Japan) and Mr. Takashi Ishikura (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Japan) for their technical comments on data analysis.Conflict of interestNone declared.

IntroductionEpigenetic regulation has remained of fundamental interest in understanding gene regulation in eukaryotes. Epigenetic regulation involves differential methylation at cytosine residues and post-translational modifications of histones.1 One of the most comprehensively investigated mechanism of chromatin modification in plants,2 DNA methylation involves covalent transfer of a methyl group to C-5 position of the cytosine ring by DNA methyltransferases and is transmitted across generations.3 DNA methylation acts to regulate transposons and repetitive genome sequences and often results in the suppression of gene activity. 4,5 A major difference between DNA methylation in animals and plants is that in plant genome, DNA methylation occurs at CG, CHH and CHG sequence contexts (where H could be C, T or A).6 It has been shown in Arabidopsis that different enzymes regulate methylation at different sequence contexts. Methyltransferase 1 (MET1) causes and maintains methylation at CG sites6–8 and chromomethylase 3 (CMT3) produces and maintains methylation at CHG sites6,9,10 and this maintenance is further required to preserve methylation patterns over generations. On the other hand, domains rearranged methyltransferase 2 (DRM2) and 24 nt siRNAs, which guide methyltransfrase to specific DNA segments, regulate de novo methylation CHH sites,6,10,11 which is maintained by CMT2.12De novo methylation of all three different sites involves 24 nt smRNAs (small RNAs), DRM2 and the Dnmt3 homologue involved in RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). In RdDM, RNA is transcribed by the RNA polymerase POLIV, which is then made double stranded by RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs), cleaved to 24 nt by Dicer-like enzymes and loaded onto argonaute proteins. This effector complex then interacts with other proteins and Polymerase V transcripts to target homologous regions of the genome for methylation by the recruitment of DRM2. The methylation state of CG is maintained during cell replication by MET1, which recognizes hemi methylated CG sites and methylate the newly formed DNA strand. CMT3 maintains CHG methylation, while CHH methylation is recognized by a histone methyltransferase kryptonite (KYP), which can then methylate the H3K9 residues. These two enzymes work in a feedback loop enabling the maintenance of both epigenetic marks, with the absence of either CMT3 or KYP leading to a reduction in CHG methylation. DNA methylation plays an important role during different aspects of plant development and growth. Of these heterosis or hybrid vigour is of vital importance in agriculture. Heterosis is a phenomenon where F1 progeny of a genetic cross exhibits superior characteristics comparedwith its inbred parental lines and has been documented nearly 300 years ago.13 In recent years, several studies have focused on the role of epigenetic regulation in mediating hybrid vigour in model plant Arabidopsis.1,14–17 Previous studies in Arabidopsis have suggested that interaction between similar genomes and different epigenomes of the two different parental ecotypes could result in new transcriptional profiles in hybrids that might contribute to hybrid vigour in the progeny.18,19 Also, it has been proposed that epigenetic regulation via changes in methylation patterns might play a role in mediating differences in gene expression levels that may confer increased biomass in heterotic hybrid offspring of Arabidopsis ecotypes C24 and Landsberg erecta.15 It has also been documented that both DNA methylation patterns and sRNA (small RNA) levels are altered in intraspecific hybrids of Arabidopsis,15,20–22 rice23 and maize.24Recent advances in DNA methylation profiling techniques have enabled in understanding the correlation between methylation patterns and hybrid vigour in several crop species as well such as rice and Brassica25,26 but knowledge about interaction of methylation patterns and gene expression in legume plants such as pigeonpea has still remained elusive. Pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan (L) Millsp) is a important grain crop with high protein (20–22%) grain legume, mainly cultivated in the tropical and subtropical parts of the world. Pigeonpea contains 11 pairs of chromosomes (2n = 22) and has a genome size of 858 Mbp.27 Globally pigeonpea is cultivated on 5.4 Mha, with an annual production of 4.4 MT and a yield of 8299 hg/ha. Pigeonpea is grown in about 50 countries with India occupying 66% of its area (FAO, 2016, http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QC). India is also the largest producer and consumer of pigeonpea with an annual production of 2.51 MT.Pigeonpea is characterized by significant genetic variability. Genetic studies have also revealed the occurrence of non-additive genetic variation in pigeonpea hybrids.28 This particular property has become popular among breeders to produce varieties with improved fertility and been utilized through cytoplasmic male sterility (CMs) system. CMS is a condition in which the ability of a plant to produce fertile pollen is severely impaired. In this condition, rearrangements in mitochondrial genome result in chimeric mitochondrial open reading frames (ORFs), generating non-functionality in anthers. However, the expression of such chimeric mitochondrial ORFs can be suppressed by fertility restorer gene in F1 hybrid, thus restoring fertility. This kind of hybrid breeding technology involves three parents— a male sterile parent, its maintainer and a fertility restorer line (commonly called—A, B and R lines, respectively; reviewed in detail in the literature).29 Few CMS associated mitochondrial orfs have been identified in pigeonpea.30In this study, we have investigated whether there are any epigenetic changes in F1 progeny of cross between 11 A (male sterile) and 303 R (fertile) inbred lines and whether those changes could potentially mediate an impact on the gene expression patterns including those involved in fertility restoration in the hybrid. We conducted whole genome bisulfite sequencing of 11 A, 303 R parental genotypes and their hybrid to generate whole genome cytosine methylation profiles and found that overall, hybrid methylome was remarkably altered compared with the parental methylome due to the events of transchrosomal methylation and demethylation in hybrid. We next carried out transcriptome profiling of the same plants and compared methylation status of the differentially expressed genes between parental inbreds and the F1 hybrids. We found differences in methylation patterns in the three genotypes, suggesting the involvement of DNA methylation in regulation of gene expression and possibly influencing sterility and fertility.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material and growth conditionsPigeonpea lines 11 A and 303 R31 were crossed by hand pollination using 303 R as pollen donor to generate hybrid. Seeds were collected and F1 seed resulting from the cross along with seeds from parental lines were sown again together for further experimental work. Seeds were directly sown in the soil in green house under natural conditions. All the plants were grown at the same time under exactly similar growth conditions to reduce the impact of any environmental variations. Fertility status of all three genotypes was verified by pollen analysis. Pollens were fixed on a glass slide using 2% acetocarmine. Pollens stained with acetocarmine were considered to be fertile. After pollen verification, young leaves of same age from the three lines were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen and used to extract DNA and RNA for further work.2.2. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing library construction and data analysisHigh molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated from the leaves using cetyl trimethylammonium bromide method. DNA was fragmented into 100–300 bp using Covaris followed by end repair by adding ‘A’ and True seq methylated adapters were ligated. The ligated DNA fragments were subjected to bisulfite treatment using EZ DNA Methylation-Gold Kit, according to manufacturer’s instructions. The BS libraries were amplified, quality tested using Bio-analyzer (Agilent 2100) and subjected to Ilumina Hi-seq2000 for 90 cycles in paired-end mode. The adaptors and poor quality reads were removed from the raw data using TrimGalore (https://github.com/FelixKrueger/TrimGalore). High quality reads were mapped to the reference genome27,32 using BSMAP33 at default parameters. Methylation information was extracted using Python script. Reads were mapped on chloroplast genome to calculate methylation efficiency and error rate. A bisulfite conversion rate of  >99% was obtained for all three samples. In-order to determine true methylated cytosines, P-values were calculated using binomial distribution P= binomial (m, x, error rate), where m= number of methylated reads, n= number of non-methylated reads and x= m + n (coverage on a single C).15 Cytosines with P-value < 0.0025 were considered to be truly methylated. Fraction and mean methylation level was calculated as described previously.342.3. Identification of differentially methylated regionsTo identify differentially methylated regions (DMRs) at each sequence context (CG, CHG and CHH), genomes were tiled using a sliding window approach with 100 bp window sliding at 100 bp interval for CG and CHG and 150 bp for CHH. Methylation information for each window was calculated using Methyl kit.35P-value for each window was calculated using Fisher’s exact test. To determine q-values, P-values for each window were corrected using sliding linear model . Following criteria were used for identification of DMRs. Windows contained at-least three methylated cytosines for CG and CHG; and six for CHH DMRs.Bases having more than 10X coverage were considered.Bases having more than 99.9th percentile coverage were discarded to minimize errors arising due to PCR bias.Windows with methylation difference greater than 20% for CG, CHG and 25% for CHH were selected.Fisher’s exact test corrected q-values < 0.01.2.4. Validation of methylation levels using bisulfite sequencing PCRTwo different regions were chosen one for validating methylation levels, one in the intergenic region and the other one in the exonic region. For bisulfite PCR, genomic DNA was extracted from 11 A and F1 hybrid and subjected to bisulfite conversion using EZ DNA Methylation-Gold™ Kit. Primers were designed using METHPRIME36 (Supplementary Table S1). Bisulfite converted DNA was amplified and the fragments were cloned into pGEMT vector. Ten colonies were picked randomly for sequencing. The results were analyzed using QUMA.372.5. RNA sequencing library construction and analysisTotal RNA was extracted from the same plants used for BS Seq. Equal amount of total RNA from three biological replicates were pooled. About 1 µg of the total pooled RNA was used to purify poly-A containing mRNA molecules. The purified mRNA was fragmented into smaller pieces and reverse transcribed into cDNA. The cDNA fragments were subjected to end repair by adding single ‘A’ base. True seq adaptors were ligated and cDNA libraries were amplified for 15 cycles. Quality of the library was assessed using Bioanalyzer and the validated library was sequenced by Illumina Hi-Seq 1000 according to manufacturers’ instructions. The quality of the raw reads was determined using FastQc (https://www.illumina.com/products/by-type/informatics-products/basespace-sequence-hub/apps/fastqc.html). Adaptors and poor quality reads were cleaned using Trim Galore. High quality paired end reads were aligned to reference genome (Supplementary Table S2) using Bowtie alignment program,38 then relative abundance of transcripts was calculated using RSEM.39 Transcripts with zero Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM) value were excluded from analysis. Raw reads count data were imported into R environment and data table containing fragment counts for each transcript were combined and matrix was formed to identify differentially expressed gene using edgeR.402.6. GO enrichment analysisTo identify and categorize cluster of differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and genes enriched for methylation in all the three categories (11 A vs. 303 R, 11 A vs. hybrid and 303 R vs. hybrid), GO enrichment analysis was performed using python based program GOATOOLS (https://github.com/tanghaibao/goatools) and Wego.41 Genes with Bonferroni-corrected P-values < 0.05 using GOATOOLS were considered to be enriched.2.7. Identification of transposable elementsA denovo repeat library was generated using repeatmodeller (http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler/; version 1.0.11).This customized library was used to run RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org/; version- 4.0.7) to identify and annotate transposable elements (TEs) in pigeonpea at default parameters. TE shorter than 100 bp were excluded from the analysis and the distance between TE, less than 50 bp were conconated (Supplementary Table S3).2.8. Allele specific methylation analysis using single nucleotide polymorphismSingle nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from parental lines and hybrid were identified using BIS–SNP,42 a variant caller from BS reads. For this, the mapped methylated reads were used as input files along with pigeonpea reference genome.32 SNPs detection was performed using the following parameters: ‘-T BisulfiteGenotyper -stand_call_conf 20 -stand_emit_conf 0 -mmq 30 -mbq 17 -minConv 20’. Spurious SNP with quality score less than 20, more than 120x read coverage, strand bias more than—0.02, quality score by depth less than 1.0, mapping quality zero reads, fraction more than 0.1 and 2 SNPs within the 20 bp bin were further filtered out using VCF post process command.3. Results3.1. Genome wide methylation analysis in pigeonpeaTo understand the possible roles of epigenetic regulation and the dynamics of DNA methylation during hybrid formation in pigeonpea, we crossed 303 R (Fertile, pollen donor) and 11 A(sterile) lines. Since their F1 progeny restored fertility (Fig. 1A), we hypothesised that it could possibly partially attributed to the new epigenome resulting from the interaction between the two parental epigenomes. Thus, in-order to gain deep insights into the epigenome of the parental lines and their F1 hybrid, we deciphered their respective whole genome methylation pattern at single base resolution. For this high molecular weight genomic DNA was isolated from the leaves of 10 days after flowering (DAF) old plants from three different genotypes, namely 11 A, 303 R and F1 hybrid progeny of 11 A and 303 R. The DNA samples were subjected to bisulfite treatment to generate genomic libraries for high throughput bisulfite sequencing. The reads obtained were processed for removal of adapter and low quality sequences. About 80–100 million cleaned reads (in each of the three genotypes) were mapped on to the reference genome.27,32 We found that more than 80% reads got mapped on to the reference genome. Thus eventually, 46 408 326, 54 030 096 and 43 763 469 reads were obtained for 11 A line, 303 R line and their F1 hybrid progeny, respectively, that mapped uniquely to the reference genome and providing a coverage more than 20X. These were subjected to further analysis of cytosine methylation at single base resolution. Further, to calculate the frequency of cytosine conversion, reads were mapped to un-methylated chloroplast genome. We obtained a conversion rate of more than 99% in all the three genotypes, indicating high efficiency of cytosine conversion in our experiments (Supplementary Table S4).

Scale bars 50µm (A).We then deciphered the fractional proportion of DNA methylation and found that CG methylation was highest in 11 A (41.7%) while CHH methylation was highest in F1 hybrid (28.82%). Methylation in CHG context were similar in all the three genotypes (~34%) (Fig. 1B). Highest mean methylation was observed in CG context (74%-79%), closely followed by CHG (56%–63%) while mean methylation in CHH context (10–15%) was lowest in both the parents and the hybrid (Fig. 1C). Comparative analysis of fractional methylation levels in pigeonpea, soybean, brassica, oryza and populus revealed that pigeonpea genome was hypermethylated compared with the other crops. Interestingly, CHH methylation levels in pigeonpea genome were significantly higher than those observed in soybean, brassica, oryza and populus25,43 (Fig. 1D). It has been documented that the DNA repeats in the genomes are highly methylated in symmetric contexts.9,44,45 Pigeonpea geneome is highly repetitive (47%) compared with soyabean46 and Arabidopsis.47 Thus, such high levels of DNA methylation in pigeonpea may arise from the occcurance highly repetive genome.Visualization of chromosome wide distribution of CG, CHG and CHH methylation revealed higher CG and CHG methylation levels compared with CHH while relatively even distribution pattern of CHH methylation (Fig. 1E, Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). High CG and CHG methylation were correlated with transposon rich regions across the genome (Fig. 1E, Supplementary Fig. S1A and B).3.2. Patterns of DNA methylation in genic and transposable elementsTo precisely understand the methylation patterns of the protein coding genes, genes with inserted TE elements were excluded from analysis. We calculated the methylation levels in the genic region and 2 kb upstream and downstream regions of the gene bodies in the two parental lines and their hybrid and found significant methylation differences between the three lines (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P-value < 2.2e-16, n = 26,774). These differences reflect differential methylation patterns in the genic regions of parental lines and their hybrid. Furthermore, upon a detailed investigation of methylation pattern, we observed the occurrence of a single CG methylation peak within the gene body and two troughs near transcriptional start and termination sites in pigeonpea, invariably to earlier reports in other plants.43,48,49 However, contrary to a recent report in rice,48 we found over all low CG methylation levels within the coding regions compared with their flanking regions. A similar trend was observed for CHG methylation, however, the average CHG methylation both within the coding regions and their flanking regions were comparatively lower than CG methylation. CHH methylation however showed a different trend to both CG and CHG methylation in terms of a plateau instead of a single peak within the gene body. Overall CHH methylation both within the genic regions and their flanking regions were significantly attenuated than CG and CHG methylation. However, the hybrid exhibited mid parental range for CG and CHG but a higher CHH methylation compared with parental lines, suggesting altered CHH methylation patterns in the genic regions in pigeonpea hybrids (Fig. 2A). Distribution of methyl cytosines in genes and transposable elements in pigeonpea.

Note higher mCs throughout the transposons compared to genes (Colored figure is available in the online version of the article).Distribution of methyl cytosines in genes and transposable elements in pigeonpea.

Note higher mCs throughout the transposons compared to genes (Colored figure is available in the online version of the article).Eukaryote genomes are abundant in TEs, also called mobile elements. TEs are structurally divergent, epigenetically controlled and are mostly involved in genome evolution and gene activity regulation. Thus, we sought to gain a comprehensive insight of the influence of DNA methylation on the transposable elements within the pigeonpea genome. Since no complete dataset on pigeonpea TEs is available, we used repeat masker to identify and classify them. TEs shorter than 100 bp were excluded from analysis. In total, we found 105 733 TEs, which we classified into retro transposons and DNA elements. We next calculated their CG, CHG and CHH methylation levels in all the three genotypes and found that irrespective of their categories, methylation was highly enriched in all the contexts in TEs compared with the gene body. However, interestingly, we found relatively lower CG and CHG methylation levels in the TEs flanking regions than those of the genic regions. By comparing the methylation levels in long terminal repeats within the three genotypes, we found relatively higher methylation levels in F1 hybrid in all the three contexts, compared with the parental lines except for CG methylation in flanking regions where 11 A exhibited higher methylation levels (Fig. 2B). While, in the case of LINE elements, 11 A displayed hyper methylation compared with the F1 hybrid and 303 R in CG and CHG contexts (Fig. 2C). DNA elements were relatively hypermethylated than the class 1 transposons. F1 hybrid displayed uniformly higher methylation irrespective of the mC contexts (Fig. 2D). Overall we observed comparatively lower methylation levels in 303 R, compared with 11 A and F1 hybrid (Fig. 2B–D), suggesting differences in the regulatory mechanisms of TE silencing via methylation in pigeonpea.3.3. Fertile and sterile pigeonpea inbred lines display locus specific differences in cytosine methylationEarlier work in crop plants such as rice and maize have documented differences in methylation levels between a male sterile plant and a fertile plant and revealed hyper-methylation in sterile lines compared with fertile lines.50,51 This suggests differential cytosine methylation could possibly influence fertility and sterility in plants by regulating gene expression. Therefore to investigate whether pigeonpea 11 A and 303 R inbreds exhibit differences in their methylation levels, we compared the methylome of the two lines. Several studies have documented that viewing differential methylation in windows of multiple cytosines seems to reflect more functional consequences rather than viewing at single sites.52,53 Also it is known that CG, CHG and CHH methylation levels are maintained through different regulatory mechanisms.6 Thus, to identify DMRs between 11 A and 303 R lines, we decided to investigate and categorize differential methylation for all the three contexts, CG, CHG and CHH, separately. We averaged the DNA methylation for all the three contexts independently across non-overlapping 100 bp regions (windows), as done previously.54 In-order to categorize a DMR window as CG, CGH or CHH, different conditions were applied. To assign a DMR to CG or CHG category, windows having at-least three cytosines with a minimum of 10X coverage were used. A minimum difference of 20% in CG and in CHG methylation each was chosen. Previously, it has been reported that CHH methylation patterns appeared to be more variable than CG and CHG.54 Since CHH methylation sites are much abundant in genomes and still, the CHH methylation levels were observed to be much lower than the CG and CHG methylation levels (Fig. 1), different criteria were applied for CHH DMR identification. To assign a DMR to CHH category, each window had at-least eight cytosines with minimum of 10X coverage and a minimum of 25% difference in CHH methylation. Eventually, we identified much more CG DMRs (11,300) than CHG (6988) and CHH (8061) DMRs between 303 R and 11 A parental lines (Supplementary Table S5). We also found that the differential methylation between the two parents was more enriched in upstream flanking sequences of the genes than the down stream regions (Fig. 3A). We next assessed relative methylation percentages of the obtained DMRs between the 11 A and 303 R parents (11 A vs. 303 R or Sterile vs. fertile) and found enrichment for hypermethylated CHH DMRs and hypomethylated CG DMRs (Fig. 3B). This suggests that in 11 A line, genes involved in regulation of CG methylation are less active than the RdDM pathway genes and CMT2 that are involved in the regulation CHH methylation (Supplementary Fig. S2).

Since fertility is restored in the F1 hybrid and earlier studies in Arabidopsis showed higher methylation levels in hybrid compared with parental lines,15,20 we therefore investigated whether there is differential methylation between individual parental lines and the fertile hybrid (Supplementary Table S5). Consistent with previous studies, we found a relative increase in the percentage of methylated cytosines in CG, CHG and CHH DMRs in the hybrid compared with parental lines (Fig. 3B) indicative of occurrence of non-additive methylation in pigeonpea hybrids. We randomly chose hyper and hypo methylated DMRs between sterile parent and F1 hybrid in intergenic region and coding regions. Analysis of their methylation levels using bisulfite sequencing PCR revealed relatively higher methylation levels in intergenic region associated DMR than in the coding region associated DMR (Supplementary Fig. S3) consistent with our in-silico data.In-order to assess the functional categories of the genes associated with the DMRs between parents and hybrids and to investigate whether DMRs were associated with genes involved in DNA methylation, epigenetic processes or fertility regulation, gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed. We found genes ontology terms for regulation of flowering time, DNA methylation, regulation of gene silencing by miRNA, developmental processes, Histone H4 K4 methylation, DNA methyltransferase, transcription factors, proton transporting ATP synthase activity, regulation of post transcriptional gene silencing were enriched (Fig. 3C). Interestingly, we also observed a strong enrichment of DMRs in gene is associated with aldehyde dehydrogenase activity. A previous study have reported that RF2 encoded aldehyde dehydrogenase activity is required to restore male fertility in maize and also plays a role in anther development.55 Our results thus suggest a possible correlation between differential methylation and fertility or sterility in 11 A, 303 R pigeonpea inbred and their hybrid. Also, genes involved in cellular processes, biosynthetic processes and ATP binding were significantly enriched (Bonferroni corrected P-value < 0.05; Fig. 3C, Supplementary data S1).Overall, our results indicate that differential methylation could be involved in mediating and regulating several cellular and developmental processes in pigeonpea.3.4. Trans-chromosomal methylation events alter pigeonpea hybrid methylomeOur results so far show altered methylome in pigeonpea hybrid compared with parents. The changes in hybrid methylome occur at DMRs between the parents and are mediated by either increase or decrease in DNA methylation termed as non-additive methylation.15,20 This increase or decrease occurs via altering methylation status of one parental allele to resemble that of the other parental allele, events known as trans-chromosomal methylation (TCM) and trans-chromosomal demethylation (TCdM).15 We investigated non-additive methylation in F1 hybrid to understand its methylome dynamics. To understand this mechanism, DMRs between the two parental lines were identified and mapped onto the F1 hybrid genome. Average methylation of the mapped loci was calculated in F1 hybrid. Mean parental value (MPV) of the DMRs between parents were obtained and compared with observed methylation in hybrid. Loci having methylation difference of atleast 20% were considered as non-additive methylation sites. Subsequently, we found non-additive methylation in 28% DMRs suggesting methylation interaction at these regions in F1 hybrid. We further analyzed the nature of this non-additive methylation and observed patterns of Trans-chromosomal methylation at 3,911 DMRs and Trans-chromosomal demethylation in 5,377 DMRs (Fig. 4A and B). By investigating the genomic features of the DMRs showing non-additive methylation, we found a higher proportion resided in TE (25%) as compared with the genic regions (15%). These results are in accord with previous findings revealing the roles of TE in genome stability and their regulation by methylation. Furthermore we found that in all the three contexts, the methylome of F1 hybrid resembled more of the 303 R fertile parent than the 11 A sterile. CG and CHG methylation levels of 303 R fertile parent and hybrid were much higher than the 11 A sterile parent. In contrast, CHH methylation levels of 303 R fertile parent and hybrid were lower than that of the 11 A sterile parent (Fig. 4A). Additionally, to decipher the number of direct TcM and TcDM non additive mC clusters, we used an alternative approach of SNPs as described previously.15 For this, we tracked 75,340 mC clusters of parental origin and followed the methylation pattern of parental alleles with differences in methylation level (3,222 out of 75,340) in hybrid using SNPs. We observed 27% mC clusters were stably inherited in hybrids indicative of additive methylation. Among the clusters showing non additive methylation, we observed, TCM events in 18.5% cases where methylation of epi-alleles from low parent increased in the hybrid, whereas methylation of high parent epi-alleles remained unchanged in the hybrid, resulting in an over all increase in methylation in the hybrid. While in 24.1% clusters, TCdM was observed where methylation of the epi-allele from low parent remained unchanged but methylation of the epi-allele from high parent decreased in hybrid, resulting in an overall decrease in methylation in hybrid (Fig. 4C). (A) Heat maps showing the methylation status of DMRs of the parents and methylation pattern at those loci in the F1 hybrid.

Transcriptome profiling in pigeonpeaIn order to assess the transcript abundance and differential gene expression between the three genotypes, their whole transcriptome profiling was performed by RNA sequencing. We first compared the transcription between different genotypes (11 A vs. 303 R, 11 A vs. F1 hybrid and 303 R vs. F1 hybrid) to compute genes that were differentially expressed between these lines. The transcripts showing a minimum of 2-fold change and P-value <0.05 were considered differentially expressed. We found 1,621 (460 up, 1,161 down), 1,790 (1,052 up, 738 down) and 1,380 (963 up, 417 down) genes that showed differential expression in 11 A vs. 303 R, 11 A vs. hybrid and 303 R vs. hybrid, respectively. We found that in all the three cases of comparison, the differentially expressed genes were well represented in gene categories like pentatricopeptide repeats (PPRs)- associated proteins involved in fertility restoration,56 methylases, demethylases and histone modifying genes (that play a role in epigenetic regulation) and flowering-associated genes. We performed gene ontology enrichment analysis to identify functional categories of significantly enriched genes (Supplementary Figs S4–S6). Interestingly, we found that gene ontology terms included reproductive processes, developmental processes, protein–DNA complexes and nucleic acid binding proteins that were significantly enriched (Fisher’s exact test P-value <0.05) in all the three comparative scenarios 11 A vs. 303 R, 11 A vs. hybrid and 303 R vs. hybrid.3.6. Correlation between DMRs and gene expression in pigeonpea inbred and hybrid lineWe next asked if the differential methylation in the three different genotypes could potentially influence the gene expression in these plants. For this, first DEGs with DMRs localized in 2 kb flanking (upstream and downstream) and gene body regions were identified as DMR-associated DEGs. Then the correlation between whole genome differential methylation and gene expression was examined (Fig. 5A–C). We next determined the genes that were enriched for DMRs between the three genotypes and found that DMRs were localized in 3,019, 1,996 and 2,233 genes in 11 A vs. hybrid, 11 A vs. 303 R and 303 R vs. hybrid, respectively (Fig. 5A–C). Among these, 290, 586 and 578 genes were found to be both differentially expressed and associated with DMRs in 11 A vs. F, 11 A vs. 303 R and 303 R vs. F, respectively (Fig. 5A–C). Furthermore, we also investigated the correlation between methylation status and expression in the DEGs associated with DMRs and found that 127 (16 hypomethylated and up-regulated; 111 hyper-methylated and downregulated), 75 (29 hypo-methylated and up-regulated; 46 hypermethylated and down-regulated) and 229 (197 hypo-methylated and up-regulated; 22 hyper-methylated and down-regulated) genes showed a negative correlation between their expression and methylation in 11 A vs. R, 11 A vs. Hybrid and 303 R vs. Hybrid, respectively (Fig. 5D and Supplementary data S2). In order to gain insights into the biological significance of the observed negative association between DEGs and DMRs, we investigated the functional categories of those genes. Interestingly we found many DMRs showing negative association with gene expression in fertile hybrid and 303 R lines, compared with 11 A (sterile) line belonged to transposable elements and genes that coded for PPR-associated proteins (Fig. 5E–G). In addition, we also found genes coding for histone deacytylase and methyltransferase (Fig. 5E–G). This suggests that the transcription of those genes might possibly be influenced by methylation.

Association between DNA methylation and transcript abundancePrevious studies have reported a negative association between gene expression and CHG and CHH methylation in plants like cotton.57 Therefore to investigate the occurrence of any relation between changes in methylation levels and gene expression in pigeonpea, we classified genes into four quartiles based on their FPKM values—undetectable expression (FPKM 0-1), low expression (FPKM 1-10), moderate expression (FPKM 10–100) and high expression (FPKM > 100) according to the criteria described in earlier studies58,59 and correlated with changes in their methylation levels. Consistent with previous studies, we found CHG and CHH methylation were negatively correlated with gene expression levels. However, additionally, we also found negative association between CG methylation and gene expression (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S7). Since transcription is importantly controlled by upstream and downstream regulatory sequences of the genes, we also sought to examine methylation levels in the gene flanking sequences. Similar methylation levels were observed in the sequences upstream and downstream of genes with high, moderate and low expression. However, contrary to this, genes with no expression exhibited high methylation in their flanking regions suggesting that a high methylation in upstream and downstream regulatory sequences might be critical for suppressing transcript levels (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S7). We also found that the presence of TE elements within the genes or in the vicinity resulted in a comparatively reduced expression relative to the genes without TE elements within or in the neighboring regions (Fig. 6B).

DiscussionRapid advancements in genome sequencing techniques have enabled genomic comparisons to understand genetic diversities between different plant species or different ecotypes of the same species. However, understanding of epigenetic variation among different ecotypes has become equally important to decipher its role in generating phenotypic variations. A fundamental question of great importance is that how the parental genome combination is regulated in hybrids to give rise to significantly different hybrid genome which results in altered genetic traits. It is widely speculated that many agriculturally important phenomena such as hybrid vigour and fertility restoration may arise due to epigenetic changes between inbred parents and hybrid lines. Thus the field of epigenetic research has expanded its horizon by adopting many crop species as model systems. However, there are still agriculturally important crops such as pigeonpea, in which existence of such mechanisms have remained unexplored. In this study, we investigated and compared epigenetic changes in three different pigeonpea genotypes. We have generated whole genome methylation profiles of sterile (11 A), fertile parents (303 R) and their fertile F1 hybrid, which were unavailable till date. Our analysis of relative fractions of methyl-cytosines in each methylation context in the three pigeonpea lines revealed highest fraction of mCs in CG context, followed by CHG and CHH. Similar pattern of distribution of methylation fractions has been observed previously in rice seedlings60 and Soybean leaves.61 We also found that average methylation levels of the fertile hybrid and the fertile parental line (303 R) were lower than the sterile parent (11 A) suggesting that comparative low DNA methylation of genes may play a role in restoring the fertility in the F1 hybrid.Mean methylation has been reported to be highest in CG contexts in other plants such as Rice60 and Arabidopsis,15 and followed closely by CHG and CHH. However, our results show that in pigeonpea, mean methylation levels in CHH context are much lower than CG and CHG methylation levels. This suggests a possibility of overall low expression of genes involved in regulation of CHH methylations such as those involved in RdDM pathway that target homologous regions of the genome for methylation62 in pigeonpea compared with Rice and Arabidopsis.Previously, it has been reported that transcription of genes is affected by methylation in the promoter region but not in the internal regions. However, transposon silencing is regulated by methylation both in the promoter region as well as internal regions.63 Our data demonstrate that fraction of mCs was higher in the transcribed regions of transposons than the transcribed regions of the genes. As shown in Figure 2, the fraction of methyl cytosines in upstream sequences of the transcribed regions of transposon was almost two times higher than fraction of mCs in upstream sequences of genes. Additionally, gene bodies of TEs exhibited higher methylation than their upstream and downstream regions. Contrary to this, genes had lower methylation in the transcribed regions than their flanking regions. As suggested previously for other crops,1,64 this could potentially be a consequence of reduced RdDM pathway activity within the gene body of the transcribed genes compared with TE. Furthermore, we also observed that the fraction of mCs in upstream regions of transposons in fertile 303 R parent was slightly less than sterile 11 A parental line and the fertile hybrid. These observations suggest that one possible epigenetic mechanism of regulating transposon inactivation in pigeonpea could be via methylation and this mechanism could be comparatively weaker in the fertile 303 R line than in the sterile parent and fertile hybrid. Over all, our results comply with previously documented findings that CHH methylation levels are usually lower than CG and CHG, both on a genomic scale and at specific loci.65,66Further, our findings also reveal the existence of non-additive methylation in F1 hybrid due TCM and TCdM events. TcM mediated increase in DNA methylation were more frequently observed in CG context and TcDM mediated decrease in DNA methylation were more frequently observed in CHH context, consistent with previous findings in Arabidopsis.15 Furthermore, we also dissected the mC changes of differentially methylated parental epi-alleles in the hybrid, using SNPs for tracking the parental epi-alleles in the hybrid. Our analysis revealed that majority of the mC clusters having SNPs showed non- additive methylation in the hybrid when parents had different levels of methylation (HP or LP), consistent with our general mC cluster analysis.Transposable elements can influence neighboring gene expression, contribute to inheritance of epi-alleles and thus represent the most striking and common example of epigenetic inheritance in plants.67 Consistently, our data also revealed low expression of genes with inserted TEs suggesting similar roles of TEs in pigeonpea.We also found a strong enrichment of DMRs in a wide spectrum of genes that are associated with chromatin modification and have been reported to regulate flowering, heterosis and reproduction in rice.68 We also found genes involved in DNA methylation that are known to play a role in transposon repression69 and genes involved in histone methylation that help regulate flowering.70DNA methylation is known to influence gene expression. However, as mentioned above, it has been proposed that DNA methylation and H3K9 methylation in the gene body regions do not affect gene abundance. Despite increased CHG and H3K9 methylation in loss of function mutants of a H3K9 demethylase gene increased in bonsai methylation 1 (ibm1), the expression of their target genes remained unaffected.63 Also, absence of CG gene body methylation in the loss of function MET1 mutants did not alter gene expression.71 Surprisingly, we found a negative correlation between transcript abundance and methylation levels in all the three contexts in the gene body suggesting a more prominent role of DNA methylation in regulating gene expression in pigeonpea. Previous studies in Arabidopsis have reported that methylation in the promoter regions resulted in lower gene expression.71,72 Furthermore, another study in soybean revealed negative correlation between gene expression and DNA methylation in their promoters.73 We also found that high methylation in the 5’ upstream regions of the genes were negatively correlated with gene expression levels, consistent with the idea that DNA methylation in the promoter regions affects gene abundance.61 Our results in pigeonpea together with previous results in soybean73 open new avenues for understanding the relationship between gene expression and gene body DNA methylation and whether they play a direct role in restoring fertility in pigeonpea hybrids requires further investigation.The raw reads of bisulfite and transcriptomic study were submitted to NCBI Sequence Read Archive under bioproject accession PRJNA435649 and SRP133358 study.We thank Council of Scientific and Industrial Research, Government of India for the award of a senior research fellowship, ICAR-IARI, ICAR-NRCPB and NRCPB in house project, New Delhi for supporting A.J. and providing other funds and facilities.

IntroductionIn most animal species, sex-determination is governed by chromosomal differences involving two common sex determination systems: XX/XY sex chromosomes determine female/male, e.g. in Homo sapiens, Drosophila melanogaster and Anopheles gambiae and other species and WZ/ZZ sex chromosomes determine female/male, e.g. in Bombyx mori, Gallus gallus. Previously people believed a sex determining gene would be localized in a unique sequence domain of a heterogametic sex chromosome; thus many studies were focused on fishing or positioning unique sequence domains on W- or Y-chromosomes. In this way, DMY of the medaka fish was identified as a sex-determining gene.1 However, Y and W chromosomes present special challenges for whole genome shotgun assembly,3–5 because they are enriched with interspersed repeat elements and segmental duplications.6,7 Even though some unique domains exist on Y or W, many transposable elements (TEs) interrupt these unique sequences into short pieces, making it difficult to find such unique domains. Thus, whole genome shotgun methods, even the latest third generation sequencing techniques (e.g. PacBIO) which can produce very long reads, cannot effectively assemble high quality contigs or scaffolds of Y and W chromosomes at present stage,8–10 which obstructs studies of sex-determination and sexual development and reproduction.In most genome projects, Y and W chromosome sequences are fragmented into a large number of small, unmapped scaffolds.11 Recently a few researchers have applied the CQ (Chromosome Quotient) method12 or YGS (Y chromosome Genome Scan) method11 to identify Y-linked sequences in these unmapped scaffolds. The CQ method uses the number of alignments from male and female sequence data to determine whether a sequence is Y-linked.12 The YGS method, on the other hand, is based on a comparison of the assembled genome with female short-reads.11,13 We tried to apply both methods in B. mori to find W-derived contigs. However, both methods can only identify limited number of contigs. In CQ method all repeat sequences must be masked and the female to male ratio is not always precise, especially in short sequences (length <= 2 kb) with few reads aligned. As YGS method is based on genome sequences, implementing it in species without reference genome is difficult. Consequently, both methods cannot work very effectively in B. mori, especially for short sequences. Hence, neither of them provides a reliable strategy for de novo assembly of Y or W chromosomes, which restricted the application of the two methods in many other species.Just like the previously mentioned two methods, many studies concentrated on how to eliminate repetitive sequences from the sequence data. However, the majority of Y or W chromosomes are composed of repetitive sequences and many functional domains may be inserted into TEs, which means very limited unique contigs can be found if all repetitive sequences are removed. Nevertheless, many mutations accumulate on Y or W repetitive sequences and Y/W chromosome have no recombination with X/Z chromosome, which may generate some specific SNPs that can be used as molecular markers to find Y or W linked sequences. So we can utilize these repetitive sequences, instead of masking them, for identifying Y or W linked sequences.11 Based on this concept, we applied a novel K-mer Quotient (KQ) method as a more easy, effective and accurate way for comprehensive analysis of the B. mori W chromosome. It can provide a strategy for de novo assembling of contigs of Y or W chromosomes, unlike the CQ or YGS method. Moreover, in addition to B. mori, we successfully applied this method to two diptera, D. melanogaster and An. gambiae, as XX/XY sex determination species. As a complete genome sequence is not necessary and removal of repeat sequences is not needed for the successful implementation of our method, it can also be applied to species where genomic information is scarce. Additionally, the KQ method can be extended for the identification of Y or W-linked transcript RNAs and small RNAs, thus providing an innovative approach to study the functions of W or Y chromosomes without complete sequence information.2. Materials and methods2.1. Short readsAll sequencing data produced in the present study have been deposited in the NCBI Short Read Archive and can be accessed under the SRA accession number PRJNA393916. B. mori female and male HiSeq reads were produced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer (101-bp pair-end using pools of larval posterior silk gland which yielded ~73-fold coverage of genome for each sex). B. mori female MiSeq reads (only used for assisting de novo assembly of W contigs) were produced on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer (250-bp pair-end; pools of female larvae; ~20-fold genome coverage). All reads were from Dazao, the inbred strain used in the genome project.14 The next generation sequencing data for male and female D. melanogaster pooled 5 day old mated adults was downloaded from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive [SRA: SRP007888]; the next generation sequence data for male and female An. gambiae pooled wild type strain was downloaded from NCBI Sequence Read Archive [SRA: SRP014756].12,15 Preferably, to ensure the accuracy of the KQ method, male and female sequence data should be from highly inbred populations and data for both sexes should be of the same amount. Since the coverage of the next-generation sequence data can affect the calculation of the KQ value, from our experience, we suggest that more than 50X coverage is an appropriate choice, which can produce a more precise high-frequency W-15-mer. B. mori RNA-Seq data of mixed sex embryos from 0–24 hpo were produced using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer, yielding 101-bp pair-end and 24 G clean data for each of the different periods (0, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 24 hpo). Small RNA sequences have been deposited in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession numbers from AB386191–AB424683.2.2. Criteria for filtrating valid W-specific k-merThe genome sequence of males and females differ only by the W chromosome, which produces W-specific k-mers. These k-mers are present only in the female data, but absent from the male data. Before doing a female vs. male k-mer comparison, removal of sequencing errors in the reads is important in order to achieve high resolution. This was done using two criteria: (i) masking low quality bases and (ii) filtering k-mers with rare frequency. Specifically, for the B. mori reads, the sequencing errors were filtered by masking bases with phred score <20 and removing 15-mers that were present fewer than 5X in reads. Counting k-mers for separate female and male data and removal of sequencing errors can be done using Jellyfish.16,17 We set up the KQ parameter, for a given k-mer Ki, KQ(ki) = M(ki)/F(ki), where M(ki) is the frequency of Ki in male reads, F(ki) is the frequency of Ki in female reads. To obtain reliable W-derived k-mers, we used the strict criterion of KQ = 0. To reduce the interference of individual polymorphism in sequencing reads, we filtered out these k-mers (KQ = 0) with low frequency (<15, Supplementary Fig. S1) in female reads.2.3. W-derived reads and de novo assembly strategyReads containing W-15-mers could be W-derived and therefore called W-reads. We screened the W-reads from B. mori Illumina female reads with Bowtie.18 Since the reads were paired ends, if a single read sequence was W-derived (contained W-15-mer), its corresponding pair end read could be also W-derived even without a W-15-mer. Based on this assumption, we screened W-derived paired-end reads and assembled them using the MaSuRCA assembler. To prevent incorporation of invalid contigs originating from misassembly, a criterion was followed to filter out invalid contigs. We aligned all the W-15mers to all contigs with 0 mismatch using Bowtie, and calculated the amount of W-15-mers per Kb sequence (AWK) for each contig. From the scatter distribution map (Supplementary Fig. S2), we found that when the AWK value was less than 10, the scatters deviated from the main trend line, indicating that such contigs with fewer W-15-mers were possibly not W-derived. Thus, we set a threshold of AWK = 10 for filtering invalid contigs. Whereas in the case of very short contigs (less than 1 kb), we suggested that at least 10 W-15-mers were required to be aligned to such contigs.2.4. AWK threshold in transcripts and small RNAsFor identification of W derived contigs from the already assembled genome sequences, it is also appropriate to set the same threshold with AWK = 10 as followed previously. However, for identification of transcripts and small RNA sequences we must follow different criteria. Considering that de novo assembled RNA transcripts were composed of different exons and free from introns, we could increase the threshold to AWK = 50 for W-derived transcripts. Thus, we suggested that it is better to choose a number from 10 to 50, since the higher AWK value gave more reliable results but fewer W-derived transcript RNA candidates and the lower AWK values gave more candidate sequences but less reliable results. As for the small RNAs, we counted the number of aligned W-15-mers for each small RNA and set a threshold with no less than three aligned W-15-mers. Similarly, this threshold is also flexible and can be increased for higher confidence results, or can be decreased for a higher number of W-linked small RNA candidates.2.5. Application and limitation of the KQ methodDifferent species have different genome sizes and therefore the k value of k-mer needs to be changed according to the genome size. The k-mer size should be large enough so that identical k-mers seldom occur from sequencing errors.19,20 On the other hand, run time and memory usage would be sharply increased with larger k values. Thus, k = 15 for Drosophila, and k = 18 for humans are typical values used for filtering errors in short reads from these genomes.19,20 Taking the above information and results from the YGS method into consideration, we recommend initial values of k = 15 for insect-like genomes (approximately size 100–500 Mb) and k = 18 for vertebrate-like genomes (approximately size ~2 Gb).2.6. Molecular biology methodsBombyx mori (Dazao strain) larvae were reared on fresh mulberry leaves in a dedicated silkworm rearing room at ambient temperature (23–27 °C). Genomic DNA samples were separately isolated from virgin female and male individuals with tissue DNA kits (OMEGA, Norcross, GA). In the case of W contigs that had autosomal or Z paralogs, primers for genomic DNA PCR were designed considering the differences between the autosomal or Z paralogs and the W sequence at the 3’ end of the primer. PCR was performed with GO Taq DNA Polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI; Supplementary Table S1–S3), RNA was isolated from individual embryos following the traditional Trizol method (Ambion, Carlsbad, CA) using the total RNA isolation protocol according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Residual DNA in samples was used to identify the gender of each embryo with the W_seq1 marker (Supplementary Table S1). Total RNA (following DNase treatment) was subjected to reverse transcription using a PrimeScriptTM RT Master Mix (Perfect Real Time; TaKaRa, Kusatsu, Japan) in 50 µl reaction volume (2500 ng total RNA) and then diluted 5-fold. One µg of cDNA was used in 10 µl PCR reaction volume. Small RNAs (following DNase treatment) were subjected to reverse transcription using a Mir-X™ miRNA First-Strand Synthesis Kit (TaKaRa, Kusatsu, Japan). qPCR was performed with SYBR Premix Ex (TaKaRa, Kusatsu, Japan).3. Results and discussion3.1. The KQ methodAlthough most of the B. mori W chromosome is composed of TEs whose copies are widely distributed on autosomes or on the Z chromosome, still some subtle variations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can be observed only on W chromosome. Such W-specific variations may produce W-specific short sequences called k-mers.For obtaining these possible W-specific k-mers, we tried to find an optimum k value (sequence length). K = 15, which is a typical value used for filtering errors in short reads,11,19 is suitable for female-specific (W-specific) k-mers in B. mori. We counted the frequencies of each 15-mer separately in female and male sequence data and created a parameter called KQ. For a given k-mer Ki, KQ(ki) = M(ki)/F(ki), where M(ki) is the frequency of Ki in male reads and F(ki) denotes the frequency of Ki in female reads. As females and males share the same complement of autosomes, autosomal 15-mers are present in both female and male sequencing data in roughly the same quantities. Therefore, autosomal 15-mers have KQ values distributed around one (Fig. 1). As males have two Z chromosomes while females have only one, the Z-specific 15-mers have KQ values distributed around two. Since unique W chromosomal 15-mers are present only in female sequencing data, these KQ values localize to zero. We also applied KQ to D. melanogaster and An. gambiae [Fig. 1, exchange M(ki) and F(ki) position in XX/XY species]. The results were similar to B. mori, which confirms that KQ may be applied to most sexually heterogametic species. Distribution of calculated KQs. We counted the KQ value for each 15-mer and constructed a distribution histogram for B. mori, D. melanogaster and An. gambiae.It is apparent that most autosome-derived, Z specific or W unique 15-mers have distinctive KQs. Autosome derived 15-mers have a KQ value around 1 (mainly from 0.3 to 1.8), Z or X derived 15-mers have a KQ value around 2 (mainly from 1.8 to 2.2) and W or Y derived 15-mers have a KQ value around 0. Thus, we can easily identify W specific 15-mers by the KQ value.Distribution of calculated KQs. We counted the KQ value for each 15-mer and constructed a distribution histogram for B. mori, D. melanogaster and An. gambiae.It is apparent that most autosome-derived, Z specific or W unique 15-mers have distinctive KQs. Autosome derived 15-mers have a KQ value around 1 (mainly from 0.3 to 1.8), Z or X derived 15-mers have a KQ value around 2 (mainly from 1.8 to 2.2) and W or Y derived 15-mers have a KQ value around 0. Thus, we can easily identify W specific 15-mers by the KQ value.In our assumption, these W or Y-specific 15-mers (KQ = 0) could be used as labels to identify sequences from W or Y chromosome. To verify such an assumption, we first applied it to D. melanogaster Y, which has been relatively well sequenced. We aligned all Y-specific 15-mers (Y-15-mers) of D. melanogaster to its genome scaffolds (Genebank assembly accession: GCA_000001215.4), and a parameter named AYK (Amount of Y-15-mers per Kb sequence) was created for each scaffold. Based on the analysis of each scaffold’s AYK value and length (Fig. 2A), we could show clearly that the majority of scaffolds are Y-derived (red points) when AYK >=10, while scaffolds of X or autosome (blue and green points) are with the AYK < 10 and some unmapped scaffolds (grey points) with AYK value >=10 are also possible Y-derived. The result confirmed that our KQ method could effectively identify Y-linked sequences. Except KQ method, we also applied previous CQ and YGS method in D. melanogaster, and compared the results of three methods to evaluate which method could be most effective (We only selected contigs with AYK >=50 in KQ method to unify the standard of three methods). For 200 already known Y-scaffolds, CQ method could identify only 63 of 200 as Y-linked, whereas YGS identified 106 and our KQ provided 154 Y-scaffolds. Figure 2B showed that for more than 5 kb scaffolds, three methods could identify most Y-linked scaffolds, whereas for less than 5 kb, KQ method worked obviously better than the other two methods. Thus, compared with other two methods, KQ method performed more effectively for short scaffolds (less than 5 kb). As Y and W chromosome sequences are usually fragmented into a large number of short and mostly unmapped scaffolds due to highly repetitive sequences, KQ method would have wider application in heterogametic organisms, particularly for the species in which genomic information is still scarce. Identification of Y-linked sequences in D. melanogaster. (A) We applied KQ method in genome sequences of D. melanogaster and counted length and AYK value for each scaffold. For the vast majority of Autosome (green point) and X-derived (blue point) scaffolds, their AYK values are less than 10 (usually close to 0); Y-derived scaffolds (red point) were with AYK value more than 10. Unmapped scaffolds (grey point) have dispersive AYK values, we speculated that scaffolds with AYK value more than 10 are possible Y-linked. (B) Compared with the CQ and YGS methods, KQ method could identify more precise Y-derived scaffolds in D. melanogaster. Based on the analysis of scaffold length and number, the results of three methods were similar when the length of scaffold is more than 5 kb, whereas KQ method (red pillar) could identify more precisely Y-linked scaffolds when the length of scaffold is less than 5 kb.Identification of Y-linked sequences in D. melanogaster.

De novo assembled W specific genome contigs and identification of W-BACsWe obtained 93,942 high-frequency 15-mers (frequency >=15 in female reads), where the KQ values were zero in B. mori. These 15-mers (W-15-mers) could not be aligned onto a male genomic assembly, which strengthened the likelihood of W-specificity. As reads containing W-15-mers could be W-derived, we aligned all the W-15-mers to female genome sequencing reads and screened the reads containing W-15-mers. We obtained about 1.1 million HiSeq paired-end reads (101 bp, ~216 Mbp) and 0.6 million MiSeq paired-end reads (250 bp, ~300 Mbp) as W-derived reads, which were assembled into 6718 W-specific contigs using the MaSuRCA assembler.21 We set a threshold AWK (Amount of W-15-mers per Kb sequence) value = 10 and considered contigs with an AWK value greater than 10 as valid W-specific contigs (Supplementary Fig. S2). Eligible contigs of 1281 were selected with a total length of around 1.9 Mb, which covered almost 1/10 of the W chromosome. To confirm these contigs were indeed W-derived, we randomly chose 10 of them (named W_Seq1 to W_Seq10) for a separate PCR test with female and male genomic DNA. The primers were designed to have W-15-mers at the 3’ end and used a relatively high annealing temperature to reduce the likelihood of primer mismatch.22–24 PCR bands appeared only in females for all 10 primer pairs, (Fig. 3A), indicating that all of them were W-specific.

The silkworm BAC reference library (derived from both sexes) contains 74,717 BACs, for which about 200–500 bp ends have already been sequenced with the Sanger ABI3730 sequencer.25 Using the threshold AWK value = 10,122 BAC end sequences were obtained to be putatively W derived, and we chose 10 of them at random to confirm their W specificity by PCR test against female vs. male genomic DNA (Supplementary Table S2). The presence of PCR bands only in female genomic DNA confirmed (Fig. 3B) that all 10 BAC end sequences were W-specific, i.e. the corresponding BACs were also W-derived.The results indicated the KQ method could effectively assemble and identify contigs originating from the W chromosome. These contigs will be invaluable in the search for W-specific PCR markers. The length of B. mori W chromosome may have the same size with Z chromosome (~20 M) depending on the relative cytogenetic length26 and if we obtain a sufficient number of W-BACs, it would be possible to construct BAC contigs covering the whole W chromosome.3.3. Identification of W-linked transcript RNAsUse of RNA-Seq has improved the identification of a large number of cellularly expressed RNA species. However, little information is reported on how many of these are actually transcribed on the W chromosome. Here, we applied the KQ method to RNA-Seq data derived from silkworm embryos to find W-linked transcripts. We performed deep RNA-Seq for 0-24 h post-oviposition (hpo) mixed embryo samples (each sample contained 5–6 unsexed embryos), which we assembled de novo using the Trinity assembler,27 and obtained 175,492 transcript RNAs including different alternative splicing isoforms. We then screened for valid W-derived RNAs with a strict threshold of AWK value = 50 and thus selected a total of 156 candidate W-linked RNAs. Using an expression heatmap to analyse the data (Fig. 4A), we observed two main expression clusters: in Cluster A RNAs initiated from 16 hpo; in Cluster B RNAs were continuously expressed from 0–24 hpo.

Expression profiles of transcripts in mixed embryos (0–24 hpo) were clustered and visualized in a heatmap. (B) PCR amplification of W-derived transcripts in cDNA (Left panel) and gDNA (Right panel). RT-PCR (cDNA) showed expression as cluster A (female embryos specific) or cluster B (in both female and male embryos). However, a PCR test of genomic DNA showed both transcript RNAs were female-specific, indicating that they are W-derived, but cluster A RNAs are zygotically expressed in female embryos whereas cluster B RNAs are probably maternal RNAs deposited into eggs.

(C) qPCR of a cluster B RNA (DN42314_c0) from 0 to 36 hpo exhibited its sex-biased expression in embyos.To confirm that these RNAs were indeed W-derived, five candidates were selected for examining their expression in individual embryos. We designed primers using their W-k-mers (Supplementary Table S3) in the same way as for W-BAC ends. We isolated both DNA and RNA from single embryos aged 16 hpo, and used DNA to detect the presence of the W chromosome by PCR (Supplementary Fig. S3), while we followed RNA by RT-PCR to examine expression (Fig. 4B). The RT-PCR results showed cluster A RNAs were expressed only in female embryos, whereas cluster B RNAs were expressed in both female and male embryos. For further verification, we performed a separate PCR test of both cluster A and B RNAs with female and male genomic DNA. For these five RNAs, PCR bands appeared only in female genomic DNA (Fig. 4B), indicating both cluster RNAs were transcribed on the W chromosome. These results suggested that cluster B RNAs are very likely to be maternal RNAs deposited in the embryos as they are present throughout early embryos of both females and males. An interesting phenomenon in RT-PCR of cluster B RNAs is that bands were brighter in female than in male, which indicated the expressions of cluster B RNAs are different in female and male embryos. Thus, we did the qPCR of a cluster B RNAs (DN42314_c0) in female and male embryos from 0 to 36 hpo, and found sex-biased expression starting from 8 hpo (Fig. 4C). The expression levels were almost same in both sex embryos before 8 hpo, but after that, it seemed to fade away in male embryos and de novo expressed in female embryos.3.4. Annotation of W-linked transcript RNAsWe found 156 W-linked RNAs, among which we predicted 134 were non-coding RNAs by their Coding-Non-Coding Index (CNCI).28,29 Non-coding RNAs, most of which are long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), are the main repertoire of the transcripts expressed from the W chromosome. We found 93 ovarian piRNAs among the lncRNAs through NCBI BLAST, which implied many lncRNAs seemed to be precursors of piRNAs.With GO annotation and an NCBI BLAST search of 22 candidate coding RNA sequences, we found that many of them had high similarity with some B. mori uncharacterized genes located on an autosome or Z chromosome (Supplementary Table S4), suggesting these genes may have been translocated onto the W chromosome through transposons during evolution.30 The GO analysis showed that these coding transcripts were diverse, possibly involved in DNA integration and metabolic processes, nucleic acid binding, nucleotidyltransferase activity, etc. (Supplementary Fig. S4).3.5. Identification of W-linked small RNAsThe W chromosome being a source of female-enriched piRNAs31 indicates that W chromosome function mainly depends on them. For example, Fem piRNA was reported to be the primary sex-determiner in silkworm.32 As small RNAs are usually around 18–30 nt, it is difficult to determine whether or not they are W-derived. Using shorter length W-15-mers, the KQ method can also be used to identify W-derived small RNAs from the pool of small RNA sequences in B. mori.Kawaoka et al. (2008) identified 38,493 small RNA species from ovarian RNA (pupa day 4) in the silkworm, while we identified 72,439 small RNA species from embryo RNA of day 8 pupa. We merged the two small RNA datasets, which amounted to 106,717 small RNA species and then aligned W-15-mers to all these small RNA sequences to screen small RNAs with no fewer than three aligned W-15-mers, resulting in 345 candidates. Their sizes were mostly around 27–29 nt (Fig. 5A) with a strong bias for U(T) at the 5’ end, indicating that most of the W-linked small RNAs were piRNAs. We randomly chose 5 small RNAs out of the 345 candidates to check their expression levels using RT-PCR in separate female and male pupal cDNA (day 4, Supplementary Table S5). The bands appeared only in females for all the five small RNAs (Fig. 5B), which demonstrated that they were indeed W-derived.

DiscussionIn this study, we first explored the existence of W or Y-specific 15-mers in B. mori, D. melanogaster and An. gambiae, then developed the KQ method and obtained a successful result in D. melanogaster. After that, we applied KQ method in B. mori to assemble W-linked genome contigs and to identify W-linked transcript RNAs and small RNAs effectively. In contrast to the previously reported CQ and YGS methods, our KQ method is more effective and accurate especially in short sequences. In addition, the KQ method opens up a novel approach for de novo assembly of W contigs, and is now the only method available to identify W or Y-specific small RNAs. Also KQ method can be used to identify sequences linked to X or Z chromosome if we used X or Z-specific 15-mers (KQ value around 2). As a genome reference sequence is not necessary, the KQ method can be applied to most species with heterogametic sex chromosomes where genome information is scarce, and it could become an useful tool for obtaining whole genome information of heterogametic sex chromosomes (Y or W).The complete biological function of the B. mori W chromosome is still unclear. Although many scientists have tried to uncover the biological process of sex-determination in this species,2,26,32 the lack of W chromosome specific sequence information hinders the annotation and molecular studies of the W. Here, we showed that the KQ method could help in drastically changing this situation. We obtained W-linked transcripts and small RNAs without the use of complete genome sequences. These RNA sequences will be helpful in the functional study of the W chromosome. Based on preliminary transcript RNA analysis, we found many lncRNAs and a few possible coding RNAs expressed from 16 hpo when the sex-determination cascade initiates,33 and which may be involved in the sex determination process. Many lncRNAs seem to be the precursors of piRNAs, and our small RNA analysis showed that most W-linked small RNAs are likely piRNAs, which indicates that piRNA based gene regulation may be the main function of the B. mori W chromosome.piRNA associates with PIWI family proteins whose complexes cleave target sequences to silence genes or transposons (Aravin et al., 2006; Saito et al., 2006; Brennecke et al., 2007). For example, Kiuchi et al. (2014) found that a specific W-linked piRNA (Fem piRNA) interacts with the product of a Z-linked Masculinizer (Masc) RNA, silencing of Masc by Fem piRNA is required for the production of female-specific isoforms of Bmdsx in female embryos and that a Masc-associated process may control both dosage compensation and masculinization in male embryos.32,34,35 This suggests that W-linked non-coding RNAs, especially piRNAs, play important roles in sex-determination and dosage compensation, and may be the main functional form encoded on the W. Also many W-derived piRNAs are expressed at the pupal period, which may function to maintain germline stem cells,36,37 suggesting that the effects of W-linked piRNAs are continuous throughout female life.The authors thank Youbing Guo, Duolian Liu and Li Peng for assistance with the information analysis.

Overall, these findings impose a novel conception of genome evolution, genetic variation and survival of M. genitalium within the host.1. IntroductionPathogenic microorganisms have evolved sophisticated strategies to evade or subvert the host immune system.1 Typically, extracellular bacteria modify their surface structures or control the expression of their immunodominant proteins to avoid antibody recognition.2 These two widespread strategies meant to survive and persist within the host are known as antigenic variation (AnV) and phase variation (PhV), respectively. The sexually transmitted pathogens Mycoplasma genitalium, Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Treponema pallidum, generate AnV by means of programmed rearrangements of unique chromosomal sequences.3 These chromosomal rearrangements are essentially facilitated by homologous recombination and accordingly, RecA and other important recombination enzymes play a fundamental role in AnV.4–8 Likewise, the participation of proteins that regulate the capacity of RecA to polymerize or load onto ssDNA in the generation of antigenic variants is substantiated by several reports.9,10 Considering these studies, RecA emerges as the primary target to control sequence variation of major surface antigens by homologous recombination. Remarkably, despite RecA is critical for DNA repair and maintenance of genome stability in bacteria, the sexually transmitted pathogens aforementioned are devoid of a classical SOS system coordinating the concerted activation of recA and other repair genes in response to DNA insults.7,11–14 In light of these data, it has been suggested that the participation of RecA in the generation of genetic variants imposes important restrictions as to the multifaceted mechanisms that bacteria exploit to regulate recombination.15P140 (MgpB) and P110 (MgpC) are the major cytadhesins and the main surface antigens of M. genitalium. In its chromosome, this bacterium comprises nine DNA repeats, designated as MgPar, that contain sequences with homology to the MG_191 and MG_192 genes, which code for P140 and P110, respectively.12,16 Recombination between the cytadhesin genes and MgPar sequences provides a virtually unlimited collection of genetic and antigenic variants.17,18 Moreover, recombination with particular MgPar regions leads to the expression of truncated P140 or P110 proteins, which evidences the existence of a subjacent and versatile mechanism of PhV.19 Remarkably, P140 and P110 variation is critical for survival and persistence of M. genitalium within the host.20–23 Recently, we identified an alternative sigma factor, herein designated as s20, that controls the activation of homologous recombination in M. genitalium.24 Of note, s20 is a major determinant for the generation of genetic variants of the cytadhesin genes.24,25 s20 regulates transcription of recA (MG_339), ruvA (MG_358) and ruvB (MG_359), plus several genes of unknown function. Bewilderingly, under laboratory growth conditions, the s20 regulon is only activated in a small subset of cells in response to unidentified factors. These singularities impose single cell analyses as the only suitable techniques to study and characterize s20 activity. Of note, overexpression of s20 induces a hyper-recombinogenic phenotype that is highly deleterious.24 Despite these hitches, we recently identified two novel genes under the control of s20, designated as recombination regulatory loci A and B (rrlA and rrlB), which are intimately related to homologous recombination.24 Null mutants of these genes exhibit severe recombination defects, similar to those observed in a s20 defective mutant, but the exact role of the RrlA and RrlB proteins in M. genitalium remains obscure.Overall, in the current study we provide further knowledge regarding the function of s20 in M. genitalium. We describe the whole regulon and identify several factors controlling s20 activation and modulating recombination in this bacterium. Moreover, we reveal a link between s20 and a mechanism of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) that is mediated by the recombination machinery of this bacterium. This novel activity associated to the s20 pathway is independent of any known mobile genetic elements, which defies traditional HGT systems and might be a valuable tool for genome evolution and adaptation of this small pathogen.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains, culture conditions and primersAll M. genitalium strains were grown in SP-4 broth at 37°C in a 5% CO2 atmosphere in tissue culture flasks. SP-4 plates were prepared supplementing the medium with 0.8% agar (BD). Tetracycline (3 µg ml-1), chloramphenicol (Cm) (17 µg ml-1) or puromycin (Pm) (3 µg ml-1) were added for mutant selection when necessary. All M. genitalium strains used in this work are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Escherichia coli strain XL-1 Blue was used for cloning and plasmid propagation. The strain was grown in Luria Bertani (LB) or LB agar plates containing 100 µg ml-1 ampicillin, 40 µg ml-1 X-Gal and 24 µg ml-1 Isopropyl ß-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) when needed. All primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S2.2.2. DNA manipulationStandard techniques for cloning were performed as described in Sambrook and Russell.26 Plasmid DNA was obtained using Fast Plasmid Mini kit (5Prime). PCR products were purified from agarose gels using Nucleospin Gel and PCR Clean-up kit (Macherey-Nagel) and digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes (Fermentas) when necessary. Plasmids for M. genitalium transformation were obtained using the GenElute HP Midiprep kit (Sigma).2.3. Mutant construction, transformation and screeningA detailed explanation of the steps and methodology, including primers and plasmids, used to construct all the mutants created in this study is supplied as Supplementary Information. Transformation of M. genitalium was carried out as previously described.24 Screening for mutants was performed using cell lysates as template for PCR or sequencing reactions. Cell lysates were obtained by centrifugation of 5 ml cell cultures, disruption of pellets using 30 µl of Lysis Buffer (Tris–HCl 0.1 M pH 8.5, Tween-20 0.05%, proteinase K 0.25 mg ml-1) and incubation for 1 h at 37°C followed by inactivation at 95°C for 10 min.2.4. RNA extraction and transcriptional analysisMycoplasma genitalium was grown to mid-exponential phase in 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks. Attached mycoplasmas were scrapped off in 1 ml of fresh SP-4, inoculated in two new 25 cm2 tissue culture flasks with fresh SP-4 medium and incubated at 37°C 5% CO2 for 6 h. Then, total RNA was extracted using the miRNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) following manufacturer’s instructions. Contaminant DNA was eliminated with the RNase-Free DNase Set (Qiagen).To conduct the RNAseq study, three independent biological repeats of each strain were submitted to analysis. RNA libraries were prepared with TruSeq Stranded Total RNA Library Prep Kit (Illumina) and analysed using a HiSeq 3000 System (Illumina) at the Genomics Unit from Center for Genomic Regulation (CRG), Barcelona. cDNA clusters were immobilized in sequencing lanes of 2 × 50 reads. Prior to any data analysis, reverse and complementary was computed for sequences coming from Read1 primer. Data analysis and sequence alignment was performed using Bowtie2 tool27 in the End-to-End mode and Forward-Forward paired-ends. Sequences were piled up using SAMtools28 with no limit set to the number of sequences in the alignment. Counts in the different ORFs were performed with a standalone version of featureCounts program29 without counting the multi-mapping reads and disabling multi-overlapping reads.Counted features were then submitted to the R/Bioconductor package DESeq230,31 for statistical analysis. DESeq2 analysis used a parametric fitType and a zero-mean normal prior on the non-intercept coefficients. Data were sorted by log2 fold change and statistical significance was set at P-value < 0.05. DESeq2 was chosen as the RNAseq normalization method over other widely used procedures, such as RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase per Million mapped reads) or TC (Total Count), since a recent study has shown that DESeq2 normalization can maintain a reasonable false-positive rate in different library sizes and widely different library compositions.322.5. Primer extensionPrimer extension analyses were performed with 20 µg of total RNA as previously described.24 Total RNA was extracted from mid-log phase cultures using the RNAqueous kit (Life Technologies) and treated using Turbo DNase (Life Technologies) following manufacturer’s instructions. Fragments were analysed using PeakScanner v1.0 software (Applied Biosystems). At least two independent primer extension experiments were performed with each primer.2.6. Sequencing reactionsDNA sequencing reactions were performed using BigDye® v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit using 2.5 µl of genomic DNA or M. genitalium lysate, following manufacturer’s instructions. All reactions were analysed in an ABI PRISM 3130xl Genetic Analyzer at the Servei de Genòmica i Bioinformàtica (UAB).2.7. Quantitative assessment of the recombination capacityRecombination capacity was calculated using the transformation efficiency by homologous recombination of a suicide plasmid as previously described.24 Results presented in the manuscript correspond to at least three independent biological repeats.2.8. Phase contrast and fluorescence microscopyMycoplasma genitalium was grown in filtered (0.22 µm) SP-4 medium on IBIDI chamber slides for 16 h, washed once with 1 × PBS and visualized on a Nikon Eclipse TE 2000-E microscope. All strains were grown and visualized under the same conditions. Phase contrast and TRITC epifluorescence images were captured with a Digital Sight DS-SMC Nikon camera controlled by NIS-Elements BR software. Images were analysed using Image J software and GDSC plug-in. Fluorescence intensities were determined by quantifying gray levels of individual cells in binary images using Image J software.2.9. Mating of M. genitalium strainsMycoplasma genitalium strains were grown separately in 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks until mid-log phase. Then, cells were recovered in 10 ml of fresh SP-4 and passed through 0.45 µm filters. Four millilitre of the cell suspension from each strain were mixed and incubated in a 75 cm2 tissue culture flask with 12 ml of fresh SP-4 without antibiotic selection. After 24 h of co-incubation, cells were scrapped off in 1 ml of fresh SP-4 and 200 µl aliquots were seeded on 0.9% SP-4 agar plates (8.5 cm diameter) supplemented with Cm (34 µg ml-1) and Pm (3 µg ml-1) or used to inoculate 75 cm2 tissue culture flasks with dual antibiotic selection. To exclude transformation as a mechanism of transfer, the mating experiments were performed in the presence of DNase. After 14 days, colonies were picked up and screened for by PCR and sequencing of the resulting amplicons. Mating efficiency was calculated by dividing the number of double resistant colonies obtained on selective medium by the number of mycoplasma colonies obtained on non-selective medium. For the liquid cultures, typically 14–16 days were needed to observe colonization of the flask surface. Dual antibiotic selection was maintained during all the process. Mobilization of the antibiotic markers in the cell pools was also assessed by PCR and sequencing analysis of the resulting amplicons.3. Results3.1. Elucidation of the whole s20 regulonThe recent identification and initial characterization of the s20 regulator of M. genitalium was not accompanied by a comprehensive transcriptional study. Herein, we conducted a genome-wide RNA-Seq analysis to identify genes controlled by s20-dependent promoters. To this end, we compared RNA samples from strains lacking or overexpressing s20 to those of the wild-type strain. We found that transcription of up to thirteen genes increased significantly upon s20 overexpression (Table 1). In keeping with previous data, we observed activation of recA, ruvAB and the recombination regulatory loci rrlAB.24 Additionally, we identified three novel genes controlled by s20-dependent promoters: MG_285, MG_286 and MG_412. While the MG_285 and MG_286 genes code for two polypeptides with unknown function, the protein encoded by the MG_412 gene shows sequence homology to the substrate binding subunit of phosphate transport systems. Differentially transcribed genes upon overexpression (Up) or deletion (<U+0394>MG_428) of s20Differential gene expression compared with the WT strain and judged based on the common arbitrary 2-fold cutoff.Differentially transcribed genes upon overexpression (Up) or deletion (<U+0394>MG_428) of s20Differential gene expression compared with the WT strain and judged based on the common arbitrary 2-fold cutoff.Of note, we found that several transcripts originating from chromosomal regions without annotated genes were markedly upregulated upon s20 overexpression (Table 1 and Fig. 1A). These transcripts comprise DNA sequences with homology to the cytadhesin genes of M. genitalium. The transcript designated as ncRNA-1 lies within the MgPar-4 region of the G37 chromosome.17 It comprises the repeat G of P140 and the large KLM repeat of P110, both in the antisense orientation. Transcripts ncRNA-2 and ncRNA-3/4 lie within the MgPar-5 region, which is located immediately downstream of the cytadherence operon. ncRNA-2 comprises the repeats B and EF of P140, plus a putative novel ORF located at the 5' end of the transcript and herein designated as orf192.1. Upregulation of ncRNA-3/4 is particularly apparent and encompasses two short transcripts located immediately upstream of the EF repeat of the MgPar-5. In agreement with the intermittent activation of s20, these two short transcripts were still detected in the WT strain (Fig. 1A). In contrast, transcription of ncRNA-3/4 was downregulated by 50-fold in strains lacking s20 (Table 1 and Fig. 1A). Chromosomal localization of the ncRNAs activated by s20.

Identification of novel s20-regulated promotersPrimer extension analyses established the presence of s20-dependent transcriptional start sites (TSS) within the upstream regions of the MG_285 and MG_412 genes (Supplementary Fig. S1). Similarly, we identified TSSs upstream of the three upregulated regions without annotated genes (Supplementary Fig. S1). For the ncRNA-3/4 transcript, we identified two independent TSS. As expected, all the identified TSSs were preceded by s20 promoter sequences (Fig. 1B), which show the consensus sequence 5'-TTGTCA-N18/19-ATTWAT-3' in M. genitalium.24Remarkably, the chromosome of Mycoplasma pneumoniae carries an orthologue of the MG_428 gene and accordingly, s20-regulated promoters of M. genitalium are conserved in this close related species.24 In keeping with this idea, we identified a putative s20 promoter in the upstream region of the MPN404 gene, the ortholog of MG_285. Likewise, we found a putative s20 promoter in the upstream region of MPN143, which codes for a protein of 175 amino acids exclusive of M. pneumoniae. The MPN143 gene is located immediately downstream of the cytadherence genes (MPN141 and MPN142), a chromosomal location that is similar to the putative novel orf192.1 identified in M. genitalium (Supplementary Fig. S2).3.3. Expression of RrlA, RrlB and ORF192.1 in single cellsTo support and expand our transcriptional data, we monitored the expression of RrlA and RrlB in single cells using fluorescent protein fusions. Similarly, we used the same approach to test whether the putative novel ORF identified within the ncRNA-2 transcript, orf192.1, was expressed in M. genitalium. For this purpose, we obtained mutants carrying transcriptional fusions of rrlA, rrlB or orf192.1 to the mcherry fluorescent marker at their respective native loci, which were designated as RrlA:Ch, RrlB:Ch and ORF192.1:Ch. As previously observed for other s20-regulated genes,24 only a small subset of cells displayed mCherry fluorescence (Table 2 and Fig. 2). Remarkably, the percentage of fluorescent cells observed for each target protein was relatively diverse, which is likely due to a different strength of the transcriptional response plus specific differences in protein turnover.

White arrows indicate the presence of mCherry fluorescent cells in strains where fluorescence is rare. Scale bar is 10 µm.In agreement with the s20-controlled expression of rrlA and rrlB, we found that deletion of the MG_428 gene completely abrogated mCherry fluorescence in the population (Table 2, Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S3). Next, we reintroduced the MG_428 gene by transposon delivery (Tns20) to the mcherry mutants lacking s20 to assess complementation. Transcription of the transposon-encoded copy of the MG_428 gene was driven by the MG_427 promoter,24,33 which according to our transcriptional data is strong and not regulated by s20. Expression of the ectopic copy of the MG_428 gene reestablished mCherry fluorescence to all mutants (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S3). In particular, the presence of cells with detectable levels of RrlA and RrlB increased by 25- and 18-fold, respectively, as compared with the parental strains where s20 was expressed from its native locus (Table 2). Yet, the majority of cells from the complemented mutants were non-fluorescent. This was unexpected because transcriptional fusions of the MG_427 gene to the mcherry marker at its native locus indicate that the MG_427 promoter is constitutive (Supplementary Fig. S3). Altogether, these findings suggest that transcription of the target genes is still regulated in the complemented strains. Therefore, either the expression of rrlAB is under the control of additional factors beyond s20 or the activity of s20 is regulated at the post-transcriptional level in M. genitalium.3.4. RrlA and RrlB are necessary for the activation of the s20-regulonAiming to better understand the role of rrlA and rrlB in the recombination pathway, we deleted one of these genes from strains carrying MG_428- or recA-mcherry fusions at their respective native loci. In both mutant backgrounds, s20:Ch and RecA:Ch, the absence of rrlA or rrlB completely abrogated the presence of fluorescent cells (Table 2, Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S4). In contrast, deletion of other genes under the control of s20 such as MG_390 or MG_414, had very little or no impact on RecA expression (Table 2). Reintroduction of the rrlA or rrlB genes by transposon delivery (TnrrlA or TnrrlB) reestablished the presence of fluorescent cells to their respective mutant backgrounds (Table 2, Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S4). Hence, our data indicate an important role for RrlAB in the activation of s20-dependent recombination. Single cell analysis of RecA and s20 expression in different mutant backgrounds.

Positive autoregulation by s20Next, we wondered whether s20 expression was autoregulated. To ascertain this question, we delivered an ectopic copy of the MG_428 gene fused to the eyfp fluorescent marker under the control of a constitutive promoter of M. genitalium (Tn s20:YFP) into the s20:Ch and RecA:Ch mutants. In both cases, we observed a 6-fold increase in the percentage of cells displaying mCherry fluorescence (Table 2 and Fig. 4). In addition, the average mCherry fluorescence intensity of the population was incremented 3–6-fold by the presence of the Tns20:YFP transposon (Table 2). Altogether, these data demonstrate the existence of a positive feedback during the activation of the s20 pathway. Single cell analysis of RecA and s20 expression upon s20 overexpression. Each row contains a series of four fluorescence microscopy images corresponding to the phase contrast, the TRITC channel, the eYFP channel and the resulting overlay of the different mutants analysed.

Scale bar is 10 µm in all images.On the other hand, despite the majority of cells carrying the s20: YFP fusion showed yellow fluorescence (74.9 ± 2.3%), cells without fluorescence were also present (Fig. 4). Moreover, YFP fluorescence intensity was exceptionally heterogeneous and we observed individual cells (~2%) with an intensity 10–20-fold higher than the average of the population (Fig. 5). Of note, in the RecA-mCherry background, we observed a strong correlation between mCherry positive cells and cells with intense YFP fluorescence (Fig. 4), suggesting that s20 is more stable coinciding with the activation of the s20 regulon.

Distribution was obtained by analysing at least 150 YFP fluorescent cells from each strain. AU denotes arbitrary units.3.6. Role of RrlA and RrlB in s20 stabilityTo get further knowledge on the role of RrlAB in the activation of the s20 regulon, we deleted the rrlA or rrlB genes from the RecA:Ch Tns20:YFP reporter strain. This strain was chosen because it allows the study of s20 expression and activity at the same time. As described earlier, mCherry fluorescence was not observed when RrlA or RrlB were absent (Table 2 and Fig. 4). Concurrently, the presence of cells with YFP fluorescence was substantially reduced and cells with intense YFP fluorescence were no longer observed (Fig. 5). These data reinforce the role of RrlAB in s20 activation and suggest that these two small proteins likely stabilize s20. On the other hand, RrlA or RrlB overexpression using the TnrrlA and TnrrlB minitransposons did not modify the percentage of RecA-mCherry or s20-YFP fluorescent cells (Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. S5). Remarkably, the majority of clones (~70%) recovered from these transformation experiments showed a non-adherent phenotype, which is indicative of an increased frequency of generation of phase variants.3.7. s20 overexpression reestablishes recombination to rrlA- and rrlB- mutantsOn the basis of our findings, the participation of RrlAB in the homologous recombination pathway is expected to be indirect. To support this notion, we overexpressed s20 in mutants lacking RrlA, RrlB or RecA using the Tns20 minitransposon (Fig. 6). As expected, in agreement with the central role of RecA in the recombination pathway, s20 overexpression did not restore recombination to recA mutants. In contrast, s20 overexpression reestablished recombination to the rrlB mutant, though the recombination levels were moderate as compared with the wild-type strain. The recombination defects were still pronounced in the rrlA mutants overexpressing s20, but unlike in the parental strain, some recombination events could be detected.

Statistical significance was assessed using a standard Student’s t test (p < 0.05).3.8. s20 overexpression facilitates HGTPreviously, we described that cells with an active s20 pathway were often observed in pairs in single cell analyses.24 On the basis of this observation, we wondered whether the activation of s20-recombination could be associated to a mechanism of HGT. To ascertain this question, we mixed strains carrying two different antibiotic resistance markers in the presence of high concentrations of DNase and assessed the generation of double resistant mutants. In the first attempts, we mixed strains where s20 expression was driven from its natural locus. We used combinations of different antibiotic resistance markers and strains, but we repeatedly failed to isolate double resistant mutants. Then, we initiated experiments using strains over-expressing s20 by means of the Tns20 minitransposon (Fig. 7). This time, we successfully isolated mutants resistant to Cm and Pm upon incubation of a strain carrying the cat and tetM markers, and a strain carrying the pac gene. The calculated mating efficiency was 1.1 ± 0.2 × 10-8 transconjugants per viable cell, which is in agreement with the transfer efficiencies reported in other mollicutes.34,35 The presence of the cat and pac markers in the isolated mutants was confirmed by PCR and sequencing (Supplementary Fig. S6). Of note, we did not detect the presence of the tetM marker in the transconjugant cells, suggesting the transfer of the cat gene from the strain overexpressing s20 (donor) to the Pm resistant strain (recipient). The location of the cat gene in the recipient strain was the same as in the donor strain, suggesting that the cat marker was integrated into the chromosome by homologous recombination. Similarly, we also observed the mobilization of the pac gene from a donor strain overexpressing s20 to a recipient strain carrying the cat marker (data not shown). In addition, we also found that recipient strains receiving the ectopic MG_428 gene, responsible for s20 overexpression, become donor strains capable to transfer selectable markers (Fig. 7B).

Selection with puromycin and tetracycline allows the isolation of another transconjugant strain with the corresponding antibiotic markers but without the ectopic copy of s20. All the transconjugant strains were genotyped by PCR and sequencing.Schematic representation of representative mating experiments.

All the transconjugant strains were genotyped by PCR and sequencing.On the other hand, we found that the absence of RecA or the expression of a truncated s20 protein in the donor strain, prevented the isolation of transconjugant strains (Fig. 7A). Similarly, heat inactivation of the donor strains prevented the isolation of double resistant mutants. Moreover, we could not isolate double resistant mutants upon incubation of the recipient strains with chromosomal DNA from potential donors or plasmid DNA carrying different antibiotic markers. Altogether, these data indicate that activation of s20 facilitates cell-to-cell transfer of DNA sequences by homologous recombination by an uncharacterized mechanism of HGT of M. genitalium.4. DiscussionIn M. genitalium, homologous recombination is controlled by the alternative sigma factor s20.24 Under laboratory growth conditions, s20 activity is only observed in a small subset of cells and so far, it is unknown whether this intermittent activation is elicited by means or transcriptional or post-transcriptional factors. Herein, we assessed the expression in single cells of a s20-YFP fusion protein under the control of a constitutive, endogenous promoter of M. genitalium. We found that s20 levels were highly heterogeneous in the population and s20 expression could not be detected in numerous cells. Although we cannot rule out the existence of transcriptional factors controlling s20-activation, our results demonstrate a conspicuous post-transcriptional regulation of s20 function. On the other hand, we found a direct correlation between the presence of rrlAB, two genes subject to s20-regulation, and s20 activity. Moreover, s20 expression was negligible when RrlAB were absent, indicating that these small proteins act synergistically to stabilize and therefore prolong the activity of s20 in M. genitalium. In keeping with this idea, we demonstrate that s20 positively autoregulates its own activity, which reinforces the participation of RrlAB in a positive feed-back loop enabling s20-activation.Sigma factors direct the activity of the RNA polymerase complex to specific promoter sequences. When a bacterium expresses simultaneously more than one sigma factor, these transcription factors compete to bind to the RNA polymerase enzyme. Bacteria use diverse strategies to ensure the concurrent action of different sigma factors and to enforce transcription transition from the primary to alternative sigma factors.36 On the basis of this notion, we hypothesize that RrlAB could be important to redirect transcription from s70 to s20-dependent promoters in M. genitalium. Specifically, these two small proteins could facilitate binding of s20 to the RNA polymerase complex, which in turn could prevent the rapid degradation of the otherwise free s20 particles. The proposed role for RrlAB as sigma auxiliary proteins that assist s20 in the activation of the recombination regulon is not unprecedented. Accordingly, the positive effect of RrlAB on s20 function resembles the activity of the curli fimbriae formation regulator Crl of E. coli and Salmonella typhimurium.37,38 Crl is a small protein that binds to the alternative sigma factor sS and enhances the formation of a sS-RNA polymerase complex. This step is critical for sS activity as it aids overcoming the low affinity of the alternative sigma factor for the RNA polymerase core enzyme as compared with the primary sigma particle. Alternatively, the activity of the RrlAB could be related to anti-sigma factors, which control the availability of alternative sigma factors. In this case, RrlAB could hamper de formation of a s70-RNA polymerase complex, facilitating the activity of s20. Neither RrlA nor RrlB shows sequence homology to known anti-sigma factors, but these regulatory proteins usually exhibit low sequence conservation.39In this study, we demonstrate that strains overexpressing s20 can act as donor cells for HGT. In mycoplasmas, HGT has only been described in some ruminant species that encode integrative conjugative elements (ICE) or ICE-like sequences in their chromosomes.40,41 Recent studies have documented the transfer of large chromosomal regions between different mycoplasma strains by homologous recombination.35 A similar mechanism was described years ago in Spiroplasma citri, a species phylogenetically related to the mycoplasmas. Barroso and coworkers reported the recombination-dependent chromosomal transfer of genetic traits conferring antibiotic resistance between spiroplasma cells.34 Remarkably, these DNA transfer events were independent of known mobile genetic elements and relied on stable cell membrane fusions. Genetic fluxes in wall-less bacteria are not extraordinary, as similar chimeric genomes obtained by membrane fusions have been observed in L-forms of different bacteria.42 As M. genitalium seems to be devoid of ICE or ICE-like elements, gene transfer could be catalyzed by intrinsic non-mobilizable factors encoded in the chromosome. At the present time, it is unknown whether genes unrelated to recombination under the control of s20 are involved in HGT. However, several s20-regulated genes code for proteins with putative transmembrane domains that could be implicated in the establishment of cell-to-cell contacts and ultimately facilitate DNA exchange between cells. The ability to exchange DNA through inter- and intra-chromosomal recombination increases the potential to generate genetic diversity and the versatility of the M. genitalium chromosome.It is expected the s20 recombination pathway will be triggered by factors positioned hierarchically upstream from RrlAB in the cascade of s20-activation. Remarkably, we have strong evidence that s20 activation is inhibited or severely impaired in non-adherent strains. Indeed, transcriptional analysis of a MG_191 mutant reveals that the ncRNA-3/4 is downregulated 13-fold as compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 1A), which denotes a decreased s20 activity. Of note, the main cytadhesins of M. genitalium are reciprocally stabilized and neither P140 nor P110 is expressed in the MG_191 mutant.19 As the biological role of s20 seems intimately related to the generation of antigenic variants, it is reasonable to think that s20 activity will be less relevant in strains lacking these two immunodominant proteins. Of note, non-adherent mutants of M. genitalium arise spontaneously at relatively high-rates by means of an exquisite PhV mechanism.19,43 For this reason, it is thought that non-adherent cells play an important role in infection and survival of M. genitalium within the host. The inhibition of the s20 system in non-adherent mutants could represent an attempt to arrest this phenotype, which can often be reversed by homologous recombination. Whether P140 or other adherence-related factors are directly involved in the activation of s20, remains to be investigated. On the other hand, the prominent upregulation of the ncRNA-3/4 transcript as well as other non-coding RNAs by s20 is puzzling. In the case of the ncRNA-1, which carries homologous regions to the cytadhesins genes in the antisense orientation, we hypothesize that the activation of this non-coding RNA could interfere with the translation of P140 and P110. Silencing of the main cytadhesins could hinder the recognition of M. genitalium cells by the host immune system during a coordinated response to boost the generation of antigenic variants.Overall, in this work we have identified two factors that regulate s20 activity and are key to generate AnV catalyzed by this alternative sigma factor. Moreover, the discovery of a form of HGT in M. genitalium opens a new avenue in the understanding of dissemination of effective antigenic variants and provides some important clues as to the rapid emergence of antibiotic resistance in urogenital pathogens.We are grateful to the staff of the Servei de Genòmica I Bioinformàtica (UAB) and the Genomics Unit (CRG) for performing Sanger sequencing and RNA-Seq analysis, respectively.

IntroductionGenome editing is an essential biotechnology for medical and biological research. Zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs), transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) system have been widely used as genome-editing tools.1–3 Because CRISPR is the most convenient tool, it is rapidly becoming the predominant technique for genome editing.1–3 CRISPR also makes it much easier to perform genome editing in various cell types.3For such approaches to be successful, screening methods capable of positively identifying genome-edited cells are indispensable. Although DNA sequencing can unambiguously detect genome-edited cells, it is time-consuming, costly, and unsuitable for initial screening of a large number of clones. Therefore, various methods have been developed for rapid and inexpensive detection of the desired cells.4 For example, mismatch cleavage assays using T7 endonuclease 1 (T7E1) or Surveyor nuclease have been used to evaluate mutation frequency. In these techniques, following PCR amplification of a DNA sequence spanning a CRISPR target site, the amplicons are denatured, and re-hybridized to form heteroduplexes of wild-type (WT) and mutated strands. Mismatches between edited and unedited sites in the heteroduplexes are cleaved by T7E1 or Surveyor nuclease, and the resultant DNA fragments are electrophoresed to assess mutation frequency. The re-hybridized DNA strands can also be directly analysed by native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis.5 It is also possible to analyse mobility of the amplicons of WT and mutated strands by capillary electrophoresis.6,7 Real-time PCR has also been used to evaluate the success of genome editing. For example, in high-resolution melting analysis, melting curves of PCR amplicons are analysed to distinguish nucleotide-level differences.8 Alternatively, by monitoring fluorescence emission of SYBR Green, real-time PCR with a primer designed against the target site can be used to assess the presence of indel mutations.9 In this approach, inhibition of PCR amplification indicates introduction of indel mutations into the primer-binding site (i.e. the target site). Real-time PCR with fluorescent probes complementary to the target site (e.g. TaqMan probes) can also be used to assess the presence of indel mutations.10 Digital PCR with complementary fluorescent probes can be used for more accurate analysis.10–12 Although those methods are useful for detecting genome-edited cells, some require expensive equipment, such as real-time PCR machines or capillary gel electrophoresis systems, and they are also time-consuming. To address this issue, simpler methods using endpoint PCR were developed,13,14 in which a primer designed against the target site is used in nearly the same way as in the real-time PCR-based method.9 Endpoint PCR-based approaches can also be more cost-effective for the evaluation of indel mutations.We recently developed oligoribonucleotide (ORN) interference-PCR (ORNi-PCR) to inhibit PCR amplification in a sequence-specific manner (Fig. 1A).15 In ORNi-PCR, an ORN [not an oligodeoxyribonucleotide (ODN)] with a length of 17–29 bases inhibits PCR amplification of a target DNA sequence that contains the DNA sequence complementary to the ORN (Fig. 1A). We hypothesized that ORNi-PCR could be applied to detection of genome-edited cells (Fig. 1B). In this approach, an ORN is designed to hybridize with the target site for genome editing. Next, PCR is performed in the presence of the ORN on genomic DNAs (gDNAs) extracted from the genome-edited cells. If a mutation has been successfully introduced into the target site, the ORN fails to hybridize, resulting in amplification of the target DNA. In other words, positive PCR amplification indicates that the target site is mutated, whereas no PCR amplification indicates that the target site is intact (Fig. 1B). Because chemical synthesis of ORNs is inexpensive, it is possible to screen economically a large number of potential genome-edited cells by ORNi-PCR. In addition, endpoint ORNi-PCR does not require expensive equipment such as real-time PCR machines. Detection of genome-edited cells by ORNi-PCR. (A) Schematic of ORNi-PCR.

An ORN [not ODN] inhibits PCR amplification of a target DNA sequence that contains the DNA sequence complementary to the ORN. (B) Application of ORNi-PCR to detection of genome-edited cells.In this study, we investigated whether ORNi-PCR can be used for detection of genome-edited cells. We demonstrated that ORNi-PCR can distinguish indel mutations with even a single-nucleotide difference relative to the intact DNA sequences of target sites. However, we also found that it may be difficult to distinguish between mono- and bi-allelic mutations by endpoint ORNi-PCR. Thus, the primary use of ORNi-PCR could be the detection of genome-edited cells possessing at least mono-allelic mutations at a target site before subsequent determination of mono- or bi-allelic mutations by other methods.2. Materials and methods2.1 OligonucleotidesThe primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. ORNs were chemically synthesized (Greiner) and are listed in Supplementary Table S2.2.2 Cell culture and extraction of gDNAsRaji cells were cultured in RPMI-1640 (Wako) supplemented with 10% foetal bovine serum (FBS). 293T cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Wako) supplemented with 10% FBS. HCT116 cells were cultured in McCoy’s 5A (Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% FBS. gDNAs were extracted from cells by standard phenol/chloroform extraction.2.3 ORNi-PCRORNi-PCR reactions were performed using KOD-Plus-Ver.2 (Toyobo). For ORNi-PCR targeting the human THYN1 locus, ORNi-PCR reaction mixtures containing 20 ng of Raji gDNA, 0.3 µM of each primer, and 0.1–2 µM of an ORN were prepared in a 10 µl volume according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The reactions were carried out with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 62°C for 30 s, and 68 °C for 1 min. For ORNi-PCR targeting the human CDKN2A(p16) locus, ORNi-PCR reaction mixtures containing 20 ng of 293T or HCT116 gDNA, 0.3 µM of each primer, and 1 µM of an ORN were prepared in a 10 µl volume. The reactions were carried out with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 62°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 1 min (for Fig. 6), or an initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, and 62–72°C for 20 s (for Figs 8 and 9). For ORNi-PCR targeting both the human THYN1 and CDKN2A(p16) loci, ORNi-PCR reaction mixtures containing 20 ng of 293T gDNA, 0.3 µM of each primer, and 1 µM of each ORN were prepared in a 10 µl volume. The reactions were carried out with an initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, followed by 30 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 62°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 1 min. ORNi-PCR products were electrophoresed on 1% or 2% agarose gels and, if necessary, subjected to DNA sequencing. DNA-sequencing data were analysed using the Applied Biosystems Sequence Scanner Software v2.0 (Thermo Fisher Scientific).2.4 PlasmidsThe Cas9 expression plasmid (Addgene no. 41815)16 and chimeric single guide RNA (sgRNA) expression plasmid (Addgene no. 41824)16 were provided by Dr George Church through Addgene. To construct a sgRNA expression plasmid targeting the human THYN1 locus, a CRISPR target sequence was cloned downstream of the U6 promoter in the sgRNA expression plasmid according to the hCRISPR gRNA synthesis protocol (https://media.addgene.org/data/93/40/adf4a4fe-5e77-11e2-9c30-003048dd6500.pdf (19 April 2018, date last accessed)). To construct a Cas9 plus sgRNA expression plasmid targeting the human CDKN2A(p16) locus, the sgRNA expression cassette for CDKN2A(p16) (Gx4 no. 2)17 was cloned upstream of the Cas9 expression cassette in the Cas9 expression plasmid.2.5 CRISPR-mediated genome editingFor genome editing of the human THYN1 locus, Raji cells (1 × 107) were transfected with Cas9 expression plasmid (120 µg), sgRNA expression plasmid targeting the human THYN1 locus (120 µg), and pEGFP-N3 (0.3 µg, Clontech) by electroporation on a Gene Pulser II (Bio-Rad) at 250 V and 950 µF. One day later, GFP-positive cells were individually sorted and expanded. For genome editing of the human CDKN2A(p16) locus, 293 T cells (4 × 105) were transfected with the Cas9 plus sgRNA expression plasmid targeting the human CDKN2A(p16) locus (4 µg) and pcDNA3.1/Hygro (–) (0.4 µg, Thermo Fisher Scientific) using Lipofectamine 3000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Two days later, hygromycin was added (0.4 mg/ml), and hygromycin-resistant colonies were picked and cultured. For genome editing of the human THYN1 and CDKN2A(p16) loci, 293 T cells (4 × 105) were transfected with the Cas9 plus sgRNA expression plasmid targeting the human CDKN2A(p16) locus (4 µg), sgRNA expression plasmid targeting the human THYN1 locus (4 µg), and pcDNA3.1/Hygro (-) (0.4 µg) using Lipofectamine 3000. Two days later, hygromycin was added (0.4 mg/ml), and hygromycin-resistant colonies were picked and cultured.3. Results3.1 Determination of effective concentrations of ORNs for ORNi-PCRFirst, we asked whether ORNi-PCR could suppress amplification across a CRISPR target site in the human THYN1 locus. We designed three ORNs: ORN_20b, ORN_24b, and ORN_Target. ORN_20b (20 bases) and ORN_24b (24 bases) hybridize with the target site such that the CRISPR cleavage position, which is 3 bp upstream of the protospacer adjacent motif (PAM),18 is in the centre of their sequences. ORN_Target (23 bases) matches the 20 bp sequence of the sgRNA as well as the PAM sequence used for genome editing (Fig. 2A). Because DNA polymerases that retain 3'–5' exonuclease activity, but not those that retain 5'–3' exonuclease activity, can be utilized for ORNi-PCR,15 we used the KOD DNA polymerase19 to amplify a 0.9 kb region surrounding the target site (Fig. 2A). As shown in Fig. 2B, the 0.9 kb region was specifically amplified when gDNA extracted from human Raji cells was used for PCR in the absence of ORNs. Addition of ORN_20b (1 or 2 µM), ORN_24b (0.1–2 µM), or ORN_Target (0.5–2 µM) to the reactions strongly suppressed PCR amplification. Lower concentrations of ORN_20b (0.1 or 0.5 µM) and ORN_Target (0.5 µM) were less effective in this respect. In contrast, ORN_306F(NC), a 25-base ORN hybridizing with an irrelevant locus (human IRF-1 locus),15 did not affect amplification (Fig. 2B). Thus, these THYN1-specific ORNs can be used to specifically suppress PCR amplification of the human THYN1 locus. Suppression of PCR amplification of a target DNA sequence by ORNs.

M, molecular weight marker.3.2 Detection of genome-edited cells using ORNi-PCRTo demonstrate that this approach can detect genome-edited cells (Fig. 1B), we next investigated whether ORNs could suppress PCR amplification across an intact CRISPR target site, but not an edited variant of the same site. To this end, we performed CRISPR-mediated genome editing of the THYN1 locus in the Raji line and established genome-edited clones in which the target site was mutated in both alleles (Fig. 3A). The genome-edited cells contained indel mutations in the range of 3–501 bp (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). Clone T6 possesses the shortest indel mutation (3 bp deletion) in one allele, whereas T9 has the longest indel (501 bp insertion) in both alleles. T4 and T9 harboured homozygous indel mutations. PCR with the THYN1-specific primer set (Fig. 2A) amplified the target region from gDNAs of all cells in the absence of ORNs (Fig. 4A). In contrast, ORN_20b completely suppressed the PCR amplification from gDNA of WT Raji but not the genome-edited cells (Fig. 4A). ORN_306F(NC) had no effect on amplification.

(A and C) ORNi-PCR with gDNAs extracted from WT and genome-edited Raji cells. PCR was performed in the presence (1 µM) or absence of ORNs. M: molecular weight marker. (B) DNA-sequencing signals of PCR products. PCR products of T1, T6, and T7 in (A) [(-) ORN and ORN_20b] were purified from agarose gels and subjected to DNA sequencing.Because ORN_20b might allele-specifically suppress PCR amplification from gDNAs of T1, T6, and T7 cells, in which the CRISPR target site is differentially mutated in each allele (Fig. 3B), we sequenced the ORNi-PCR product. As shown in Fig. 4B, the sequencing signals of the ORNi-PCR products were comparable to those of PCR products generated in the absence of an ORN [(-) ORN], demonstrating that ORN_20b did not affect amplification from those gDNAs. Next, we tested other ORNs. ORNi-PCR with ORN_24b or ORN_Target, but not ORN_302F(NC), another irrelevant 21-base ORN,15 yielded PCR patterns identical to those of ORNi-PCR with ORN_20b (Fig. 4C and Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus, these results showed that ORNi-PCR can be used to distinguish bi-allelic indel mutations from an intact target sequence. Amplification of T6 gDNA was not affected by the THYN1-specific ORNs, indicating that ORNi-PCR can distinguish indel mutations of more than 3 bp in size.Next, we sought to determine whether ORNi-PCR can also distinguish mono-allelic mutations from an intact target sequence. To this end, we mixed gDNAs extracted from WT and T4 or T9 cells at 1:1 ratio to mimic mono-allelic mutations (Fig. 5). When the mixture of WT and T9 gDNAs was used in ORNi-PCR with ORN_20b, ORN_24b, or ORN_Target, PCR amplification was suppressed only when the samples contained WT gDNA, but not mutated gDNA (Fig. 5A). When the same experiment was performed with the mixture of WT and T4 gDNAs, a single band (0.9 kb) was detected (Fig. 5A); DNA sequencing of the ORNi-PCR product using ORN_20b detected the signal derived from T4 but not WT (Fig. 5B), clearly showing that ORNi-PCR amplified the edited genomic region but not the intact site. We also obtained the same results using ORNi-PCR with other THYN1-specific ORNs (Supplementary Fig. S4). Thus, these results demonstrated that ORNi-PCR can be used to distinguish mono-allelic indel mutations from an intact target sequence. Detection of mono-allelic genome editing by ORNi-PCR. (A) ORNi-PCR with gDNAs extracted from WT and genome-edited Raji cells. To mimic mono-allelic mutations, gDNAs of WT and T4 or T9 were mixed at 1:1 ratio.

PCR products of WT + T4 in (A) [(-) ORN and ORN_20b] were purified from agarose gels and subjected to DNA sequencing.Taken together, these findings show that ORNi-PCR is a useful method for distinguishing mono- and bi-allelic indel mutations from an intact target sequence. However, endpoint ORNi-PCR may not be suitable to discriminate mono- from bi-allelic indel mutations, largely because it may be difficult to quantitatively distinguish PCR products amplified from one- and two-copy templates.3.3 ORNi-PCR using the Pfu DNA polymerase, a real-time PCR machine, and crRNAsThe Pfu DNA polymerase retains 3'–5' exonuclease activity19 and can be used for ORNi-PCR.15 We therefore examined whether Pfu DNA polymerase could also be used to detect genome-edited cells. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S5, ORN_20b or ORN_24b prevented Pfu DNA polymerase from amplifying WT gDNA, but not mutant gDNA. In contrast to ORNi-PCR using the KOD DNA polymerase, the ORN_Target had no suppressive effects (Supplementary Fig. S5A and B). Thus, Pfu DNA polymerase can also be used to detect genome-edited cells if an appropriate ORN is utilized.One of the main aims of this study was to apply endpoint ORNi-PCR to detection of genome-edited cells. Nevertheless, it was also of interest to determine whether real-time (quantitative) ORNi-PCR is applicable for this purpose. To address this question, we performed ORNi-PCR on a real-time PCR machine. As shown in Supplementary Fig. S6, in real-time ORNi-PCR, PCR amplification of the THYN1 locus from WT gDNA was inhibited in the presence of ORN_24b, whereas amplification from T4 and T6 gDNAs was not affected. In addition, with a template mimicking a mono-allelic indel mutation (WT + T4), amplification was suppressed by ~60% in the presence of the ORN (Supplementary Fig. S6). In contrast, PCR amplification was not affected in the presence of an irrelevant ORN, ORN_302F(NC) (Supplementary Fig. S6). These results suggested that intact target sequences, mono-, and bi-allelic mutations can be discriminated by analysis of amplification patterns of real-time ORNi-PCR.Genome editing can be performed using recombinant CRISPR ribonucleoproteins (RNPs)20,21. In this approach, synthesized sgRNAs or complexes of CRISPR RNAs (crRNAs) plus trans-activating crRNAs (tracrRNAs) are used as gRNAs. When performing genome editing using CRISPR RNPs, it would be more cost-effective to use crRNAs rather than ORNs in ORNi-PCR to detect genome-edited cells. Therefore, we tested the feasibility of using ORNi-PCR with crRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S7). The patterns of PCR amplification in the presence of crRNA_Target, a crRNA containing an RNA sequence complementary to the CRISPR target site (Supplementary Fig. S7A), were comparable to those obtained with THYN1-specific ORNs (Supplementary Fig. S7B and C and Figs 4 and 5). crRNA_NC, a crRNA targeting an irrelevant locus (chicken Pax5 locus),22 did not affect amplification (Supplementary Fig. S7B and C). These results suggested that crRNAs can also be used for ORNi-PCR. In addition, an ORN containing irrelevant sequences in addition to a target-specific sequence could also be used for ORNi-PCR.3.4 Screening of genome-edited cells by ORNi-PCRNext, we applied ORNi-PCR to screening of genome-edited cells. Using CRISPR, we attempted to edit the CDKN2A(p16) locus in human 293T cells (Fig. 6A). After transfection of a CRISPR complex targeting this locus and single-colony isolation, gDNAs were extracted from 12 individual clones (C1–C12) and subjected to ORNi-PCR to detect genome-editing events. ORNi-PCR with ORN_p16, a CDKN2A(p16)-specific 20-base ORN (Fig. 6B and C), yielded amplification of the CDKN2A(p16) locus from 11 of the 12 samples (Fig. 6D), suggesting that genome editing had occurred in these clones. Two ORNi-PCR products were detected from the gDNAs of C9, C11, and C12, implying that these clones harbour distinct bi-allelic genome edits. The amplicon from C10 was of higher molecular weight (~1 kb), suggesting that an insertional mutation occurred in this clone. Screening of genome-edited cells by ORNi-PCR.

(F) DNA sequences around the CRISPR target site in the CDKN2A(p16) locus in genome-edited cells. The forward DNA sequences of both alleles are shown.ORNi-PCR amplified 0.8 kb products from gDNAs of C1 and C3–C8 (Fig. 6D), the same size as the PCR product obtained when using WT gDNA as the template in the absence of ORNs (Fig. 6C). To characterize the types of mutations, we amplified the CDKN2A(p16) locus from gDNAs from clones with positive signals in ORNi-PCR in the absence of ORNs and directly sequenced the amplicons (Fig. 6E and Supplementary Fig. S8). No DNA-sequencing signals corresponding to the intact CRISPR target site were detected in the amplicons from C1 and C3–C8 (Supplementary Fig. S8C), suggesting that bi-allelic mutations had been introduced into the target sites in these clones. These results of DNA sequencing were consistent with those of ORNi-PCR. Thus, ORNi-PCR can be applied to screening of genome-edited cells. Notably in this regard, no DNA fragments were amplified from C2 gDNA even in the absence of ORNs (Supplementary Fig. S8B), potentially due to deletion of primer-binding sites, insertion of a DNA sequence too long to be amplified, or translocation of the CDKN2A(p16) locus.At least three patterns of DNA-sequencing signals were detected in the amplicons of C3, C5, C7, and C8 (Supplementary Fig. S8C). Such mosaicism may have occurred in a step-by-step manner during genome editing (Supplementary Fig. S9), or have been caused by a mixture of different types of genome-edited cells (i.e. failed isolation of single-cell clones). Alternatively, it is also possible that such mosaicism was caused by aneuploidy in the cell cultures. In contrast, two patterns of DNA-sequencing signals were detected in the amplicons of C1, C4, and C6 (Fig. 6F and Supplementary Fig. S8C), suggesting that these cells were true clones of bi-allelically genome-edited cells.3.5 Screening of genome-edited cells by multiplex ORNi-PCRGenome editing can also occur simultaneously at multiple loci in a single cell. In this regard, it would be useful if genome-editing at multiple loci could be detected in a single-tube ORNi-PCR. We therefore examined whether multiplex ORNi-PCR can be used for screening of cells in which multiple target sites have been edited. Using CRISPR, we attempted to simultaneously edit the CDKN2A(p16) and THYN1 loci in 293T cells (Fig. 7A). Multiplex ORNi-PCR with ORN_p16 and ORN_24b yielded PCR products from the CDKN2A(p16) locus from gDNAs of 9 out of 11 clones (CT1, CT3–CT8, CT10, and CT11), and from the THYN1 locus from all gDNAs (Fig. 7B–D), suggesting that successful genome editing had occurred at each locus. The amplicons [CDKN2A(p16) and/or THYN1] of CT3, CT7, and CT10 were of different lengths, implying that the target loci were mutated mono-allelically or bi-allelically (Fig. 7D). To determine the types of indel mutations in the other samples, we amplified the CDKN2A(p16) and THYN1 loci in the absence of ORNs and directly sequenced the amplicons (Fig. 7E and Supplementary Fig. S10). As summarized in Fig. 7F, CT2 and CT9 harboured mutations in the THYN1 locus, but not in the CDKN2A(p16) locus, whereas the other clones harboured mutations in both loci. The types of genome editing (i.e. mono- or bi-allelic mutations) were confirmed in some samples (Fig. 7F and Supplementary Figs S10C and S11). The results of DNA sequencing were consistent with those of ORNi-PCR (Fig. 7D). Thus, multiplex ORNi-PCR can be applied to screening of cells in which multiple target sites have been edited.

DNA sequencing of ORNi-PCR amplicons of C4 and C6 (Fig. 6D) yielded one and two patterns of DNA-sequencing signals, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S12). C4 and C6 possess 1 and 2 bp deletions, respectively, in the CRISPR target site in one allele (Fig. 6F). Thus, these results suggested that ORNi-PCR can detect a 2 bp deletion but not a 1 bp deletion of C4 under these experimental conditions (hybridization at 62°C, see Section 2). We next examined whether a higher hybridization temperature would enable detection of the 1 bp deletion of C4 (Fig. 8). To this end, we performed ORNi-PCR with ORN_p16 at an annealing temperature of 70 °C (Fig. 8A and B). Under these conditions, ORNi-PCR amplified the target product from C4, but not WT gDNA. Sequencing of the ORNi-PCR amplicon of C4 yielded a signal from the 1 bp deleted template. Similar conditions enabled detection of a 1 bp insertion (the THYN1 locus in CT11, Supplementary Figs S11 and S13). Together, these results indicate that ORNi-PCR can distinguish a single-nucleotide indel mutation if the annealing temperature is optimized (Fig. 8D).

Hybridization with the 1 bp-mutated target site was incomplete at an annealing temperature of 70°C, resulting in successful amplification. The ORN hybridized with the intact target site and strongly inhibited amplification at both temperatures.We also investigated whether ORNi-PCR can detect point mutations in another sample. Here, we utilized the CDKN2A(p16) locus in human HCT116 cells as a model locus, in which an insertion of a single nucleotide (guanine) is present in the first exon in one allele (Fig. 9A).17,23 We designed an ORN, ORN_Gx5, complementary to the sequence of the G-insertion allele (Gx5) but with a single-nucleotide mismatch at the 3' position with the corresponding DNA sequence in the other allele (Gx4) (Fig. 9A). As shown in Fig. 9B, ORN_Gx5 suppressed amplification of the CDKN2A(p16) locus when the annealing temperature was 64°C, suggesting that the ORN hybridized with the target DNA sequence in both alleles. In contrast, amplification was not clearly suppressed when the annealing temperature was raised to 68°C (Fig. 9B). Sequencing of the PCR product revealed that ORN_Gx5 suppressed PCR amplification of the CDKN2A(p16) locus from the Gx5 allele, but not the Gx4 allele (Fig. 9C). Such suppressive effects were not observed when the annealing temperature was raised to 72°C (Fig. 9B and C). Thus, these results provide further confirmation that ORNi-PCR can distinguish a point mutation if the annealing temperature is optimized (Fig. 9D). Detection of a point mutation by ORNi-PCR.

(Right) At an annealing temperature of 72°C, ORN_Gx5 did not hybridize even with the target sites.Taken together, our findings show that ORNi-PCR can distinguish point mutations if the DNA/RNA hybridization is performed at the optimal temperature. Therefore, the optimal ORN hybridization temperature should be determined in advance for the detection of point mutations during the screening of genome-edited cells.4. DiscussionIn this study, we demonstrated that ORNi-PCR can be used to detect genome-edited cells without using expensive equipment such as real-time PCR machines. ORNi-PCR could discriminate an intact target DNA sequence from bi- and mono-allelic mutations (Figs 4 and 5). In addition, ORNi-PCR could be applied to screening of genome-edited cells (Figs 6 and 7). However, because it may be difficult to distinguish between mono- and bi-allelic mutations using endpoint ORNi-PCR, endpoint ORNi-PCR should be primarily used for the detection of genome-edited cells possessing at least mono-allelic mutations at a target site before subsequent determination of mono- or bi-allelic mutations by other methods (see detailed discussions on this below). In this study, we evaluated the introduction of CRISPR-mediated genome editing by ORNi-PCR. However, genome edits introduced by ZFNs or TALENs could also be detected by ORNi-PCR because the cleavage sites of these enzymes are also well defined.24Mismatch cleavage assays using T7E1 or Surveyor nuclease are often used for the evaluation of indel mutations. In these approaches, after performing PCR of the target sequences, PCR products are denatured and reannealed, and DNA bulges at mismatch sites in the heteroduplexes are cleaved by these nucleases. These approaches are suitable for the evaluation of indel mutations in pools of genome-edited cells (i.e. in cells containing mixtures of WT and/or various types mutant sequences that easily form DNA bulges at mismatch sites). However, mismatch cleavage assays would not be suitable for screening of genome-edited cells because the addition of WT gDNA to the reaction would be required to detect a homozygous bi-allelic mutation in a single clone. In addition, it may be difficult to distinguish mono-allelic mutations from heterozygous bi-allelic mutations using this method. In this context, ORNi-PCR is more advantageous than mismatch cleavage assays (Table 1). On the other hand, because ORNi-PCR generates positive PCR signals when one allele of the genome of a target cell is edited, it may be difficult to distinguish bi- and mono-allelic mutations by endpoint ORNi-PCR. This feature is one of the drawbacks of ORNi-PCR not found in endpoint PCR-based methods13,14 (Table 1). Thus, endpoint ORNi-PCR should be primarily used to detect genome-edited cells possessing at least mono-allelic mutations at a target site before subsequent detection of mono- or bi-allelic mutations by other methods. However, endpoint ORNi-PCR would still be useful if hemi-knockout is also required, as in studies of X-chromosome inactivation, genomic imprinting, and cancer.25–27 In addition, ORNi-PCR could be applied when optimal primers cannot be designed in some PCR-based methods,13 especially as ORNs can be designed flexibly on their design.15 We demonstrated that genome-editing events at multiple loci can be detected in a single-tube endpoint ORNi-PCR (Fig. 7), which has not been achievable before using endpoint PCR-based methods.13,14 In this regard, the primer combination should be more carefully considered to avoid overlap of amplicons in the endpoint PCR-based methods. Comparison of genome-editing detection methodsaProperties of these methods have been previously described.13Comparison of genome-editing detection methodsaProperties of these methods have been previously described.13On the other hand, we also demonstrated that real-time ORNi-PCR could detect genome-edited cells (Supplementary Fig. S6) and distinguish between bi- and mono-allelic mutations. In real-time or digital PCR with fluorescent probes complementary to a target site of genome editing (e.g. TaqMan probes), the decline in fluorescent emission can be taken as an indication of genome-editing events.10–12 In contrast, the fluorescence emission of SYBR Green can be taken as an indication of genome-editing events in real-time ORNi-PCR. Notably, ORNi-PCR does not require modification of each ORN with fluorescent chemicals, representing an economic advantage over other detection methods that use fluorescent probes.In our proof-of-principle experiments, genome-edited cells were efficiently isolated because of stable expression of the CRISPR complex (Figs 6 and 7, and see Section 2). Although this feature is useful for the characterization of genome editing performed by CRISPR, it is an undesirable feature in biological and medical applications. In such cases, transient expression of the CRISPR complex might be an optional strategy. However, sometimes large numbers of candidate clones must be screened if the efficiency of genome-editing is low, e.g. when the target region is not readily accessible to the genome-editing machinery, as in the case of heterochromatin. Because ORNi-PCR can detect various types of indel mutations (Figs 6–8), it would be useful for the detection of small numbers of genome-edited cells among large numbers of candidate cells.We found that ORNi-PCR can distinguish point mutations if DNA/RNA hybridization is performed under optimal temperature (Figs 8 and 9 and Supplementary Fig. S13). This property of ORNi-PCR can also be used for detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), mutations in pathogenic cells such as cancer cells, and other subtle differences in genome sequences. In this study, we estimated the hybridization temperatures of ORNs using a Tm calculation program, Oligo Calc28 (Supplementary Table S2), and annealing was performed at 62°C as a default setting in most ORNi-PCR experiments. This temperature was suitable for detection of =2 bp mutations (Figs 4, 8, and 9 and Supplementary Fig. S13). Several bases are usually edited in most cases of CRISPR-mediated genome editing in mammalian cells. In fact, we found =2 bp mutations in many cases (Figs 6 and 7). Thus, in the standard knock-out strategy, optimization of the annealing temperature might be unnecessary when screening genome-edited mammalian cells by ORNi-PCR. On the other hand, higher annealing temperatures were required to detect 1 bp mutations (Figs 8 and 9 and Supplementary Fig. S13). In this regard, if 1 bp mutations occurred in both alleles during genome editing, the method may have failed to detect such cells at an annealing temperature of 62°C. To avoid such false negatives, it is recommended to empirically determine the optimal hybridization temperature in advance by performing ORNi-PCR on WT gDNA. To distinguish single-nucleotide differences, it may be preferable to use the highest temperature at which the ORN can hybridize with the target sequence.PCR can be perturbed by unpredicted contaminants when impure gDNAs are used. In such cases, it would be difficult to judge whether the absence of amplification in ORNi-PCR reflects sequence-specific suppression by ORNs or such an undesirable perturbation. In this regard, it would be useful to amplify an irrelevant locus as an internal control in parallel with ORNi-PCR in the same reaction mixture; amplification of the internal control would indicate that the reaction conditions were suitable for PCR. In fact, we showed that it was possible to evaluate introduction of genome editing using such a multiplex PCR system, in which a target primer set, a target-specific ORN, and another primer set that amplified an internal control were mixed in the same tube (Supplementary Fig. S14). These results also ensure target specificity of the designed ORNs, and ORNi-PCR with an internal control PCR could more reliably detect genome-editing events.In this study, we used ORNs at 1 µM to screen genome-edited cells (see Section 2) because PCR amplification of a target locus in WT gDNA was completely suppressed by ORNs at 1 or 2 µM (Fig. 2B). Lower concentrations of some ORNs were less effective and resulted in the appearance of faint amplicons (e.g. with ORN_20b at 0.1 or 0.5 µM in Fig. 2B). Because such amplicons might lead to false positive results, effective concentrations of ORNs should be determined by titration as shown in Fig. 2. Additionally, we used 20 ng purified human gDNAs in 10 µl reaction mixtures for 30–35 cycles of ORNi-PCR. ORN suppression might be insufficient if excess amounts of gDNAs or more cycles are used, and might also skew the results. Concerning the DNA purification method, we used gDNAs purified by the standard phenol/chloroform extraction, which could be laborious when many clones need to be handled. Crude extracts might provide an easier option, but potential RNase activity in the crude extracts could degrade ORNs in the ORNi-PCR reactions. However, this could be avoided by adding RNase inhibitors to the reactions. To increase the flexibility of ORNi-PCR, the ORNi-PCR protocol should be further optimized in the future.In summary, we showed that ORNi-PCR can be applied to screening of genome-edited cells without expensive equipment. We believe that, despite its drawbacks, ORNi-PCR is a potentially useful tool that will make genome editing easier. In addition, ORNi-PCR enables detection of SNPs, mutations in pathogenic cells such as cancer cells, and other subtle differences in genome sequences.We thank G.M.

IntroductionTeak (Tectona grandis L. f.; 2n = 2x = 36) belonging to the mint family Lamiaceae is one of the world’s highly valued tropical timber species that occurs naturally in India, Laos, Myanmar and Thailand.1,–4 The timber is highly valued because of its extreme durability, strength, stability as well as resistance to pests, chemicals and water. Quinones and other extractives found abundant in the teakwood are responsible for its anti-termite and anti-fungal properties conferring the longevity of its timber. Thus, the wood is used in building ships, railway carriages, sleepers, construction, furniture, veneer and carving. Owing to its admirable timber qualities and aesthetical properties (Fig. 1), teak has been successfully established as pure plantations in India and elsewhere since 1850.5 The recent log export ban imposed by Myanmar has resulted steep rise in international prices of plantation grown teak from Latin America and Africa leading to expansion of plantation area. The estimated planted area of teak is about 4.25–6.89 million ha with over 1.7 million ha in India.5 Though the share of teak is <2% of tropical round wood production,6 its high value continuously attracts new planters. At the same time, natural populations are continuously diminishing due to illegal logging, anthropogenic pressures and climate change. A recent study on the effect of climate change in teak expresses the risks of biological invasion into teak habitats and recommends conservation of crucial teak growing areas and suitable management planning.7 Population structure of teak across natural and introduced locations reveal that the landraces in introduced locations have comparatively narrow genetic diversity,8 thus demanding exploration of genetic diversity of natural provenances and their conservation. Cross section of teak wood showing major features (a) pith; (b) heart wood; (c) sap wood; (d) growth ring; and (e) medullary rays.Cross section of teak wood showing major features (a) pith; (b) heart wood; (c) sap wood; (d) growth ring; and (e) medullary rays.Teak has several intrinsic genetic qualities that allow its genetic improvement for timber production. Wide and discontinuous natural distribution across varying edaphic and climatic conditions in India offers enormous potential for capturing adaptive genetic variation for genetic improvement. As a first step in the genetic improvement programme at a global level, a series of seventy five international provenance trials co-ordinated by Danish International Development Agency were established during 1973–76 across sixteen countries. Evaluation of the provenances indicated wide variation for survival, growth rate, stem form, flowering, fruit yield and wood characteristics.9,10 The results of genetic improvement in teak showed an overall positive trend, however, possible existence of non-additive genetic control for economically important traits in seed progeny generated high genetic variability even within a family.11,12 Further, it was suggested that selection of teak stem size can be carried out at the age of 3 years, wherein indirect selection on flowering age will improve forking height.13 Clonal propagation through budding, rooting of cuttings and in vitro propagation has facilitated tree improvement and deployment of superior performers for commercial cultivation towards increasing timber yield.14 Globally, although clonal seed orchards (CSOs) were established for production of quality seed stock, reproductive fitness and success of CSO was a chronic problem largely pivoted to asynchronous flowering.15Economic importance, concerns for conservation of natural populations and increase in plantation area, demand understanding the genetic basis of the economic traits in teak. Hence, like many other forest plantation species (e.g. Pinus, Populus and Eucalyptus), genetic and genomic resources in teak needs to be comprehended. Genetic diversity in natural and introduced populations of teak has been assessed with markers such as random amplified polymorphic DNA,16 amplified fragment length polymorphism17,18 and simple sequence repeat markers (SSRs) or Microsatellites.19,20 These studies generated information on population genetic structure of natural teak populations. Indian teak is genetically very distinct from Thai and Indonesian provenances and African landraces.17,19 Knowledge generated in these studies is highly useful to implement conservation programmes in teak to improve sustainable management of teak forests.20 Recently, transcriptomes of secondary wood21 and vegetative to flowering transition stage22 were developed, leading to identification of genes involved in lignification, secondary metabolite production and flower formation. Although numerous studies focused on various life history traits exist in teak, comprehensive understanding on the complete genome information remains unexplored. Next generation sequencing-based whole genome sequencing (NGS-WGS) yields more information on genomic scans of polymorphism to precisely estimate various population genetic parameters including demographic history. In this context, to enrich genomic resources in teak, the present study reports whole genome of teak through Illumina Hiseq 2000 NGS platform followed by de novo contig assembly, gene annotation and subsequent discovery of SSR polymorphism.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material and genomic DNA sample preparationOpen-pollinated seeds were collected from six dominant trees, one each from a provenance covering the entire latitudinal range of natural distribution of teak in India (Table 1). Seedlings were raised with family identity and one vigorously growing seedling randomly chosen from each family was used in this study. Genomic DNA was extracted from fresh and young leaves using standard CTAB method23 and was purified using DNAeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, USA). The quantity and quality of the genomic DNA were assessed using Nanodrop2000 (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), Qubit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) and agarose gel electrophoresis. Details of plant materials used in this studyDetails of plant materials used in this study2.2. Library preparation and genome sequencingWGS was performed using Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform and Oxford Nanopore Technologies MinION device by the Genotypic Technology, Bengaluru, India in accordance to standard protocols. Accession 2 was selected for the generation of high quality reference genome assembly. Accessions 1, 3, 4, 5 and 6 were subjected to low coverage genome sequencing to identify polymorphic SSRs. In the case of accession 2, one paired end (PE) (150 bp × 2) library of size 300–700 bp, two mate pair (MP) libraries (2–4 and 4–6 kb fragments) and one nanopore library with genomic DNA (2 µg) were prepared for sequencing. In Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, one lane of the flow cell was used for each sequencing library. Nanopore sequencing was performed using R9.4 flow cells on a MinION Mk 1B device (Oxford Nanopore) with the MinKNOW software (versions 1.0.5–1.5.12) and base calling was performed using Albacore 1.1.0 (Oxford Nanopore). Template reads were exported as FASTA using poretools version 0.6. In the case of other five accessions (1, 3, 4, 5 and 6) one PE library for each with the size of 300–700 bp was sequenced at ~15× coverage through Illumina Hiseq 2000 platform. The sequence data is uploaded in genome database of GenBank (Project id: PRJNA374940). The assembled genome, protein sequences and its annotation, GO and pathway information are available in the web link https://biit.cs.ut.ee/supplementary/WGSteak/.2.3. De novo genome assemblyThe Illumina PE raw reads were filtered using FastQC and the raw reads were processed by in-house (Genotypic Technology, Bangaluru, India) ABLT script for low-quality bases and adapters removal. The MP reads were processed using Platanus24 internal trimmer for adapters and low-quality regions towards 3’-end. The processed PE reads along with MP and nanopore reads were used for contig generation using MaSuRCA v 3.2.2 de novo assembler.25 To assemble the genome following command was used in MaSuRCA assembler: GRAPH_KMER_SIZE = auto, LIMIT_JUMP_COVERAGE = 300, JF_SIZE = 38000000000, DO_HOMOPOLYMER_TRIM = 1. Scaffolding of the assembled contigs was performed using SSPACE v 2.0.526 with processed PE and MP reads followed by gap filling using Gap Closer v 1.12.27 The genome size was estimated automatically during read computing stage which utilized both the Illuimna and Nanopore reads. Similarly, the low depth Illumina reads generated for five accessions of teak were assembled using accession 2 as reference. The sequenced data was uploaded to the Genome database of GenBank (Project id: PRJNA421422).2.4. Genome annotationFor a functional overview of draft genome, assembled scaffolds were converted to FASTA formatted sequences, hard masked by RepeatMasker tool (RepeatMasker Open-3.0; www.repeatmasker.org (10 November 2017, date last accessed)). Repeats of Arabidopsis thaliana were used as reference for genome masking. Gene prediction was carried out using Augustus 3.0.228 programme and predicted proteins were searched against the Uniprot non-redundant plant protein database (Taxonomy = Viridiplante) with BlastX algorithm with an e-value (e-10) for gene ontology and annotation. Pathway annotation was performed by mapping the sequences obtained from Blast2GO to the contents of the KEGG Automatic Annotation Server (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/kaas/ (10 November 2017, date last accessed)). List of eudicot plants used as reference organism for pathway identification in KASS server is given in Supplementary Table S1.2.5. Identification of SSRs and detection of polymorphismFASTA formatted scaffolds of teak were analysed for frequency and density of SSRs using the Perl script MIcroSAtelitte (MISA; http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/ (20 November 2017, date last accessed)). Initially SSRs of 1–6 nucleotides motifs were identified with the minimum repeat unit defined as 10 for mononucleotides, 6 for dinucleotides, 5 for trinucleotides, 4 for tetra-nucleotides, and 3 each for penta and hexa-nucleotides. Compound SSRs were defined as =2 SSRs interrupted by =100 bases. To design primers flanking the microsatellite loci, two interface Perl script modules were used to interchange data between MISA and the primer designing software Primer 3. The SSR containing scaffolds were used to design the primers with the following parameters. Primer length 18–25 bp, with 20 bp as optimum; primer GC content = 30–0%, with the optimum value of 50%; primer Tm 57–63°C, and product size ranged 100–300 bp.Polymorphic SSRs across five samples were analysed using accession 2 as reference. Polymorphic SSR retrieval tool (PSR)29 comprising two modules (PSR_read_retrieval and PSR_poly_finder) were deployed to detect SSR length polymorphisms of perfect repeats from NGS data. It is to be noted that PSR tool identifies length polymorphisms in perfect microsatellites only. Also, it filters out all the reads that match twice or more on the reference sequence as well as non-overlapping paired-end reads that are aligned on the same microsatellite locus. Minimum number of supporting reads and read depth was fixed to 10 and 30, respectively. This process detects polymorphic SSRs based on the availability of left and right border unique sequences based on the complete coverage of the SSR region in the sequence data.The polymorphic SSR data generated from PSR software was validated through gel electrophoresis. Totally 10 SSRs representing di, tri and tetra-nucleotide motifs were randomly chosen and amplified with 10 randomly selected teak trees from Topslip (Latitude: 10°29’09.5’N; Longitude: 75°50’03.8’E Altitude: 736m) provenance (Supplementary Table S2). PCR amplification were set to 10 µl volume containing 5 ng of template DNA, 2.5 µM MgCl2, 2.5 µl 10 × PCR buffer, 0.5 µM of primer, 0.5 U Taq DNA polymerase, and 2.5 mM of dNTPs. The PCR cycling profile was programmed to 94°C for 5 min, 35 cycles at 94°C for 45 s, 58°C (annealing temperature varied for each locus) for 45 s (Table 2), 72°C for 45 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Banding pattern was visualised by silver staining after denaturing polyacrylamide gel (5%) electrophoresis.

Phylogenetic tree constructionPlastid gene sequences of psbB, rbcL, psaA and ycf2 from 16 species of the family Lamiaceae were accessed from the Genbank public domain (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank (13 February 2018, date last accessed)) for constructing the phylogenetic tree with Olea europaea (Oleaceae) as the out group (Supplementary Table S3). Sequences were aligned using multiple sequence alignment tool implemented in ClustalX ver. 2.0.30 The sequences were manually refined in BioEdit ver. 7.0.9.31 Phylogenetic analyses were performed for concatenated sequences of plastid gene regions. JModeltest ver. 2.1.732 was used to choose the appropriate model of sequence evolution according to the Akaike information criterion (AIC).33 Bayesian interference analysis was performed in MrBayes ver. 3.2.6.34 The Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm was run for ten million generations, over four chains each, sampled every 1000 generations. The estimated sample size was checked using Tracer ver. 1.4 (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Tracer (22 February 2018, date last accessed)). The first 25% of the sampled trees was discarded as burn-in. The phylogenetic tree out of MrBayes ver.3.2.6 was visualized in FigTree ver.1.4.2 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/ (22 February 2018, date last accessed)).2.7. Divergence time estimationThe estimation of divergence time was performed using Bayesian approach implemented in BEAST ver. 2.4.4 programme.35 Bayesian approach was deployed to estimate divergence time of the genus Tectona with respect to the other subfamilies and genera within the family Lamiaceae. The HKY model was used based on the result of AIC from JModeltest under an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock model. Yule speciation model was used as tree prior. Two calibration points (57.6 million years ago, Mya) for Nepetoideae and 23.9 Mya for Lamioideae) were used based on the previous reports to determine specific nodes prior and lognormal distributions.36 Markov Chain was run for 109 generations, while every 1,000 generations were sampled. The chronograms shown were calculated using the median clade credibility tree plus 95% confidence intervals. Results were analysed using Tracer ver. 1.4 to assess the convergence statistics of the sequences. The effective sample sizes for all parameters and the tree files from the four runs of BEAST were combined using LogCombiner ver. 2.4.4.35 Twenty percent of the trees were removed as burn-in and the resulting trees were summarized with Treeannotator ver. 2.4.4.37 Finally, the summarized single trees were visualized in FigTree ver. 1.4.2.3. Results and discussionSeveral members of the order Lamiales are well known for their secondary metabolites of medicinal value38 and 17 species of the family were sequenced for the whole genome (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/? term=Lamiales (13 February 2018, date last accessed)) due to their economic importance. However, the woody species teak, one of the world’s premier timber species cultivated across 65 countries has only 3,269 nucleotide accessions including 6 ESTs available so far in the public domain (7 November 2017, date last accessed). Owing to the commercial importance, this study was undertaken to unravel the genome structure to facilitate conservation and improvement of teak genetic resources. The only available genomic resource in teak is the de novo assembly with transcriptome in 12- and 60-year-old trees to generate unigenes related to lignin biosynthesis.21 All the earlier gene assemblies were based on short-read technology. This work on draft genome assembly using long read technology like MP and MinION nanopore sequencing would provide an excellent resource to comprehend genome structure, genetic variation and conservation.3.1. De novo assembly and characterization of genomic sequencesThe study has generated a high quality reference genome for the accession 2 which was assembled from PE, MP and nanopore library sequences. The numbers of raw and processed reads are summarized in Table 3. High depth (109×) PE sequencing provided a global overview of teak genome with over 137.2 million PE sequences. After suitable filtration, a total of 128.2 million sequences, representing 93.43% of the raw reads were obtained. Two different MP libraries with 2–4 and 4–6 Kb generated raw reads of about 7,681 (20×) and 5,819 Mbp (15×) of which processed read length was 2,408 and 1,898 Mbp, respectively. Raw data statistics of Illumina PE, MP and Nanopore reads of teak genomeRaw data statistics of Illumina PE, MP and Nanopore reads of teak genomeNanopore library generated 782,591 reads with read length of 2,685, 280,348 bp, corresponding to 7.06× coverage of the genome. Longest read was 1,345,484 bp and the average read length was 3,431 bp. All these sequences with 151× coverage were included in whole genome assembly. Application of nanopore sequencing was challenging mainly due to large size and repetitive nature of the plant genome. However, high yield of nanopore using 9.4 chemistry has resolved this issue. Genomic applications to genetic resource conservation and breeding in forest trees is expected to harness much benefits due to the long read sequencing technologies.39 The processed PE reads along with MP and nanopore reads were assembled using MaSuRCA de novo assembler. It used all the Illumina and Nanopore reads choosing a kmer size of 105 and estimated the teak genome size of 371,016,305 bp. Genome size of teak was estimated 465 Mbp through flow cytometry (1C = 0.48 pg).40 Typically, data obtained from the WGS approach in plants with genome size exceeding a few hundred mega bases are difficult to assemble satisfactorily due to highly repetitive DNA.41 The final draft genome used for downstream analysis had 2,993 filtered contigs (>1 Kbp) with maximum, minimum and average contig length of 1,718,606, 1,100 and 106,098 bp, respectively (Table 4). The N50 value of the assembly was 357,576 bp. Comparative WGS analysis including estimated genome size, assembly statistics and annotation details of Lamiaceae members is provided in Supplementary Table S4. Draft genome assembly statistics of teakDraft genome assembly statistics of teak3.2. Repetitive genome elementsRepetitive DNAs and transposable elements are ubiquitously present in eukaryotic genomes. They provide wide variety of variations across plant species. Repetitive elements are fast evolving components of nuclear genome that play an important role in evolution of the species42 and interspecific divergence.43 The internal sequence variability of various repeat elements depends on the ratio between mutation and homogenization/fixation rates within a species.44 Repeat masking of the reference genome of teak with A. thaliana showed that a total of 19,046,577 bp (6% of the genome) had repeat elements which was very low when compared to Salvia repeat elements.45 The classification of repetitive elements of teak genome is provided in Table 5. The simple repeats were dominant occupying about 3.36% of the total genome that can aid in molecular marker development. A total of 6,976 (1.62%) retroelements, 6,518 (1.58%) long terminal repeats (LTRs), 4,431 (0.24%) DNA transposons, 2,687 (0.70%) Copia-type, and 2,499 (0.81%) Gypsy-type sequences were predicted in teak. Number of repeat elements in teak differed from other Lamiaceae members, Mentha longifolia46 and Ocimum sanctum.47,48 In M. longifolia46 LTR elements were predicted as 3,866, whereas in teak it was 6,518. In Ocimum tenuiflorum48, the percent distribution of long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), LTR, unclassified repeat elements and total interspersed repeats was 0.3, 11.07, 27.99, and 40.71, respectively, but in teak the distribution was 0.04, 1.58, 0.02, and 1.88 respectively. In contrast, small RNA repeats were not recorded in O. tenuiflorum47 but 0.03% observed in teak. Presence of higher number of simple repeats, retroelements and interspersed repeats are common in plants,49 which was reflected in teak genome as well. Overall, the percent distribution of repeat elements in teak genome seemed to be very low compared to pine genome, where 82% of genome is repetitive in nature.50 The sequencing methods, per cent coverage and regions covered in the genome influence the representation of repeat elements.51 The teak genome is estimated to be 317 Mb in length, and at least 11% of its sequence is observed to be made of repeat elements. Variations in repeat elements among the members of Lamiaceae could be due to the variations in chromosome number and ploidy level among the species which may reflect on evolutionary distances between genomes.43 Further, in this study, only 6% of the genome was used for masking and WGS assembly may have missed out some regions that are rich in repeated sequences. Overview of repeat elements in teak genomeOverview of repeat elements in teak genome3.3. Annotation and gene predictionFunctional annotation, process of identifying sequence similarity to other known genes or proteins, in teak was carried out using the hard masked draft genome for gene prediction. A total of 36,172 proteins were predicted of which 31,126 (86%) proteins were annotated against Viridiplantae (Supplementary Table S5) and 5,046 proteins were unannotated. In this study, length of the longest and shortest annotated protein sequence was 5,648 and 32 amino acids, respectively. The number of predicted genes is in accordance with Lamiaceae members, Mentha and Ocimum, except for one cultivar of O. tenuiflorum, where 53,480 genes were predicted.46–48 List of species considered for pathway analysis by homology based alignment of the T. grandis draft genome is given in the Supplementary Table S6. The proteins with >30% identity cut off were taken for pathway analysis. Overall, 344 taxa had similarity hits when searched against Uniprot Viridiplantae protein database for similarity using BLASTP programme with an e-value of e-10. Fifteen plant species showed high homology is listed out in Supplementary Table S7. Among the 31,126 predicted protein-coding genes, 17,353 genes (55%) showed high similarity to Erythranthe guttata 2,478 to Coffea canephora, 1,922 to Solanum tuberosum and 1,049 to Vitis vinifera. Highest per cent of similarity in the predicted coding genes with E. guttata (17,353 genes) could reflect genetic relationship of this genus with teak as both these belonging to the class Lamioideae.52Gene ontology analysis revealed that 48.08% genes related to molecular functions (Fig. 2a), 34.35% genes related to cellular components (Fig. 2b) and 12.56% involved in biological processes (Fig. 2c). In terms of biological processes, the major categories were transcription, regulation of transcription and metabolic and defense processes. Cellular component consisted of a major portion of integral component of membrane, followed by nucleus and cytoplasm components. In terms of molecular function, the top three GO terms were ATP binding, DNA binding and metal ion binding activities. Classification of all the protein sequences grouped under five categories such as metabolism, cellular processes, environmental information processing, genetic information processing and organismal systems. Metabolism related sequences were represented in the highest number, in which genes were representing carbohydrate metabolism (1,100) ranked first, followed by amino acid metabolism (643) (Supplementary Table S8). The top five pathways were involved in plant-pathogen interaction, plant hormone signal transduction, carbon metabolism, ribosomes, and protein processing (Supplementary Table S9). Characterization of teak genome sequence by gene ontology categories: (a) Biological process; (b) Molecular function; (c) Cellular component.Characterization of teak genome sequence by gene ontology categories: (a) Biological process; (b) Molecular function; (c) Cellular component.Teak is known for its natural resistance against various decaying agents and is highly durable. Many biochemical studies on teak wood indicated the role of several secondary metabolites and phenolic compounds including flavanoids, alkaloids, terpenoids, quinines and tannins that play a major role for its durability.53,54 This study has identified a total of 615 gene sequences that directly code for enzymes involved in the synthesis of specialized secondary metabolites (363 genes) and biosynthesis of terpenoids and polyketides (252 genes). Lipid metabolism related genes were also represented in higher number (542) (Supplementary Table S8). The colour of wood is associated with extractive content, and is a useful parameter to estimate the durability of heartwood. Identification of several genes responsible for the production of above compounds in the teak genome would pave way for understanding the basis of natural resistance of teak timber. Recently, it was shown that heartwood specific transcriptome signatures were responsible for the presence of particular secondary metabolites through functional genomics studies in Santalum album.55 Similar approaches would provide further insights into secondary wood formation in teak.3.4. The frequency and distribution of SSR types in teak genomeIn this study, totally 2,993 scaffolds amounting to 317.5 Mbp were examined for SSRs, of which 2,938 sequences were harbouring SSRs. Further, 2,846 sequences had more than one SSR and 11,255 SSRs were in compound form. Different types of SSR recorded in the teak genome are shown in Table 6. A total of 182,712 SSR motifs were identified, where perfect SSRs were represented in maximum numbers (170,574) with an overall frequency of 537.15 loci/Mbp accounting for 93% of SSRs. Compound, complex and interrupted types constituted 7% of the total SSRs, where interrupted complex type was the least in number. Among the pure repeat motifs, mononucleotide repeats were represented in maximum counts (88,766) followed by di (81,215), tri (14,654), tetra (8,086), penta (1,967) and hexanucleotides (1,161) (Table 7). Predominant (>1,000) repeat times were 12–22 for mononucleotides, 7–16 for dinucleotides, 5–8 for trinucleotides, 4–7 for tetranucleotides and 4 for pentanucleotides. The major repeat motifs with over 5000 loci were (A)n, (T)n, (C)n, (G)n, (AC)n, (AT)n, (AG)n, (GT)n and (CT)n. Nine trinucleotide, four tetranucleotide and two pentanucleotide motifs were predominant (Supplementary Table S10). (AT)n repeat motif with frequency of 131.2 loci/Mb was the most predominant dinucleotide SSRs, accounting for over 51.3% of the total dinucleotide SSRs. Primers were designed for 86,854 SSRs which had sufficient left and right sequences (Supplementary Table S11). Presence of large number of short repeat type SSR loci in the teak genome may be due to the higher genomic mutation rate and long evolutionary history of the genus.56Characteristics of six types of SSRs in teak genomeCharacteristics of six types of SSRs in teak genomeThe number, length, frequency and density of six different types of SSRsCd, compound; cx, complex; icd, interrupted compound; icx, interrupted complex; ip, imperfect; p, perfect.The number, length, frequency and density of six different types of SSRsCd, compound; cx, complex; icd, interrupted compound; icx, interrupted complex; ip, imperfect; p, perfect.3.5. Selection of polymorphic SSRs and validationSSRs have become powerful markers for population genetic analysis, QTL mapping and other related genetic and genomic studies.57 The conventional methods for SSR genotyping are labour intensive, time consuming and costly, especially for tree species that lack DNA sequence information in the public databases. The recent advances in NGS methods offer rapid identification of repeat size variations by sequencing. Five teak accessions were re-sequenced with coverage level of 7.3x–11.6x (Table 8). The PSR tool was used to compare sequence variants among the five assemblies against the SSR sequences of reference genome. Among the 170,574 perfect SSRs found in teak genome, 16,252 showed polymorphisms across these genotypes and primer pairs were developed for 13,007 SSRs (Supplementary Table S12). Heterozygous and homozygous conditions at each microsatellite locus across all genotypes were detected by the comparative module (PSR poly finder). Read Statistics of the teak samples sequenced at low depth coverage for identification of polymorphic SSRsRead Statistics of the teak samples sequenced at low depth coverage for identification of polymorphic SSRsGel electrophoresis of all the 10 primer pairs developed for polymorphic SSRs generated by the PSR software produced perfect banding pattern and no optimization of primer annealing temperature were required. All the amplified loci generated polymorphism except one locus as in the PSR results.29 Validation of more number of primer pairs in efficient allele separation systems like capillary electrophoresis would strengthen the SSR marker development. These results showed that identification of polymorphic SSRs by sequencing is highly cost efficient and rapid compared to conventional methods SSR identification.3.6. Phylogeny and divergence time estimationThe Lamiaceae (Labiatae) family contains 236 genera and over 7,000 species, and is one of the largest families of seed plants.3 The family Verbenaceae is closely related to Lamiaceae and differentiated mainly on the basis of terminal (Verbenceae)/gynobasis (Lamiaceae) style with difficulties in separating members of one family from the other.58 Previously, several genera from Verbenaceae were transferred to Lamiaceae including Tectona2,59 but the systematic position of genus Tectona still lacks clarity. Out of 236 genera of Lamiaceae, 226 were placed under seven subfamilies (Ajugoideae, Lamioideae, Nepetoideae, Prostantheroideae, Scutellarioideae, Symphorematoideae and Viticoideae) and 10 genera were listed as Incertae sedis3 (of ‘uncertain placement’) by considering morphology, secondary metabolites and molecular phylogeny.60–64 However, a recent study on chloroplast phylogeny proposed additional three subfamilies in Lamiaceae to encompass eight genera of Incertae sedis, leaving Tectona and Callicarpa unassigned.4 In the present study, potential phylogenetic plastid marker sequences, ycf2 and psbB were used to disentangle the taxonomic position of the genus Tectona. Although several different genes were used for phylogeny analysis of teak, the ycf2 and psbB genes were not reported so far. The plastid gene psbB which codes for the core protein of Photosystem II, has the highest level of translation among the chloroplast genes and provides an excellent opportunity to investigate an unusual evolutionary situation.65 Phylogenetic utility of psbB gene sequences has been tested in many plant families under the Order Lamiales such as Lamium,66,Chelonopsis,67,Salvia68 and Prosanthera69 among others. Similar to psbB, studies on molecular systematics have undoubtedly proved that ycf gene is more variable than matK in many taxa to resolve the phylogeny issues.70,71 This gene harbours highest level nucleotide genetic diversity among the angiosperm plastid genomes.72 As the number of entries of Lamiaceae members in the public domain is very less, combination of two genes, ycf2 and psbB sequences generated phylogeny tree with 16 Lamiaceae species. Inclusion of other genes (rbcL and psaA) resulted in phylogenetic tree with lesser number (10–14) of Lamiaceae species (data not shown). The resulted phylogenetic tree retained the previously reported uncertain taxonomic status of the genus Tectona, which formed a separate sister clade to the clades comprising of Laminoideae, Ajugoideae, Nepetoideae, Scutellarioideae and Premonoideae (Fig. 3). Monophyly of all the sub families under Lamiaceae were also reported.4Bayesian tree generated by analysis of two plastid sequences psb and ycf2. Posterior probabilities are shown above the branches. Scale bar specifies mean branch length. Six major clades representing subfamilies of the Lamiaceae family are indicated.Bayesian tree generated by analysis of two plastid sequences psb and ycf2. Posterior probabilities are shown above the branches. Scale bar specifies mean branch length. Six major clades representing subfamilies of the Lamiaceae family are indicated.Earlier classifications on morphology considered Tectona under tribe Tectoneae in subfamily Viticoideae.73–76 Molecular phylogeny analysis and novel combination of morphological features delineated Tectona to be an earliest diverging lineage in Lamiaceae. The phylogenetic studies of Lamiaceae family deduced T. grandis to be an early diverging lineage.4 The time estimated in the present study confirmed the early origin and divergence of the genera around 21.4508 Mya [95% highest posterior density (HPD): 10.11–34.52 Mya] (Fig. 4). Most of the genera of the family Lamiaceae were found to have a Miocene origin. Recently, two new subfamilies have been proposed to Lamiaceae viz. Callicarpoideae and Tectonoideae with Tectona as a monotypic taxon.77 Accordingly, assigning Tectona to a monogeneric subfamily Tectonoideae need to be considered, however it demands an extensive sampling within Lamiaceae and multigene phylogeny analysis to provide an appropriate taxonomical position.

ConclusionShrinkage of natural populations of teak in its native locations and worldwide increase of managed plantations demand conservation of native forests, which are critical in providing the best possible alleles to maintain genetic diversity. Captive plantations inherently have narrow genetic base, limited gene flow, and exist in non-native environments, and these characteristics often significantly alter the evolutionary trajectory leading to decrease in population fitness. Conservation and maintenance of wild progenitors are increasingly important for genetic improvement programmes. Thus, full genome sequence of teak was developed and an attempt for the functional analyses of genome components was carried out to use it as a tool for conservation and tree breeding programmes. The polymorphic DNA markers developed in this study will propel the genetic and genomic research in teak, hitherto unavailable for the highly valuable timber yielding tropical hardwood species. The draft genome of teak along with a large number of markers will benefit various explorative studies including, genetic basis of wood properties, pest tolerance, adaptive traits, germplasm movement and genetic resource conservation.We are thankful to the State Forest Departments of Kerala, Tamil Nadu and Karnataka for their permission to collect teak samples.

IntroductionDomestic pig (Sus scrofa) is an agriculturally important species and an attractive biomedical model because of its anatomical, physiological, pathological and genomic similarities to humans.1,2 However, increasing number of studies have shown that reference genomes are often incomplete and has annotation and structural defects.3,4 Thus, reference assembly and gene annotations require refinement. Obtained through short-read sequencing, the sequence data of several species have been accumulated in recent years. But the knowledge on full-length (FL) sequences of mRNAs remains scarce. Furthermore, in some cases, low-quality transcripts derived from short-read sequencing can result in incorrect annotations.5 FL transcripts can significantly increase the accuracy of genome annotation and transcriptome characterization. Several expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from FL studies have been performed in pigs,6,7 which improved genome annotation and was beneficial to downstream analysis such as expression quantification and alternative splicing (AS) identification.AS increases the variability of the cells and tissues proteome according to different splice modes in a single animal, thereby changing the composition of transcribed genes without massively increasing the number of genes.8 Since AS was discovered in 1977,9 a large number of AS events were identified in the reference genomes of human and other animals.10,11 In humans, ~20% of multi-exon genes are tissue specific and ~95% of multi-exon genes are alternatively spliced.10 In porcine, ~30% of the genes undergo AS, and 31% of the identified splice events appear to be species specific.7 AS is an important regulatory mechanism involved in gene expression and proteome diversity in individual12 and related to many diseases such as cancer and chemoresistance.13 Depending on a specific AS switch, enhancing the specific exon inclusion has potential as a clinically compatible therapeutic target.14 Accordingly, a more comprehensive and accurate identification of AS event will facilitate further cognition of the AS regulatory mechanism, scholars in medicine, genetics, bioinformatics and other fields.15Diverse classes of epigenetic regulation, ranging from ncRNA to methylation, have emerged as key regulators of gene expression, genome stability and defence against foreign genetic elements.16 Epigenetics can mediate disease aetiology through isoform variations of cytosine modification-specific transcript which are attributable to AS.17 Recently, it is revealed that CHG methylation could repress AS while CG methylation promoted AS in plant.18 However, the comprehensive relationship between DNA methylation and AS or lncRNA remains unclear in animals. Because uncertainties about the complete structure of mRNA transcripts limited the identification of splice sites and lncRNA.Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing carried out in Pacific Bioscience RS (PacBio, http://www.pacificbiosciences.com/) provides a third-generation sequencing platform widely used in genome sequencing because of its long reads (average: 12 kb).19 SMRT technology without assembling sequencing read provides direct evidence for comprehensive analysis of splice isoforms of each gene and can improve the annotation of existing gene models.20–22 Recently, Iso-Seq is used to analyse FL splice isoforms in humans20 and chickens,22 and indicates that identification of genes and splice isoforms are far from being complete even in a highly characterized transcriptome. In this study, we combined SMRT sequencing and short-read next-generation sequencing technology to generate a more complete FL porcine transcriptome further to analyse features of AS, fusion isoforms and lncRNAs. Accordingly, this study highlights the splice isoforms and transcriptome diversity and dynamics, provides a valuable resource for further investigation of genome annotation and increases our understanding of the porcine transcriptome.2. Materials and methods2.1 Animal materialsA total of 38 porcine tissues of Large White sow were collected, including 20 tissues [heart, liver, spleen, lung, kidney, stomach, duodenum, cecum, inguinal lymph nodes, precaval vein blood, ovary, uterus, corpus luteum, inner ear, subcutaneous fat, longissimus muscle, psoas muscle, soleus muscle, extensor digitorum longus (EDL) and tongue] from adult sow, and 17 tissues [heart, liver, spleen, lung, stomach, duodenum, inguinal lymph nodes, precaval vein blood, uterus, thymus, skin (dorsum), subcutaneous fat, longissimus muscle, psoas muscle, soleus muscle, EDL and tongue] from one-day-old sow and one organ (26-day-old embryo). For each tissue, total RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (REF15596026, Invitrogen) and processed following the manufacturer’s protocol.2.2. PacBio library construction and sequencingEquimolar rations of 38 samples were pooled together. Total RNA (1 µg) was reverse-transcribed into cDNA using the SMARTer™ PCR cDNA synthesis kit (Takara Biotechnology, Dalian, China) and optimized to prepare high-quality and FL cDNAs. Subsequently, size fractionation (0.6–1, 1–2 and >2 kb) was conducted using the BluePippin™ Size-Selection System (Sage Science, Beverly, MA). Another amplification was performed using 12–14 PCR cycles. Large-scale PCR products were purified with AMPure PB magnetic beads. Each SMRTbell library was constructed using selected cDNA (500 ng) with the Pacific Biosciences DNA Template Prep Kit 2.0. The SMRTbell templates were bound to polymerases using the DNA/Polymerase Binding Kit P6 and v2 primers. The polymerase-bound template was bound to zero-mode waveguide using Magbeadbingding kit (part 100-133-600). A total of 20 SMRT cells, composed of three SMRTbell libraries (0.6–1 kb: 7 cells; 1–2 kb: 7 cells; >2kb: 6 cells), were prepared on the Pacific Bioscience RS II platform by Frasergen Inc. (Wuhan, China) using C4 reagents with 240 min movies.2.3 Illumina RNA-seq library constructionIn parallel, eight tissues (subcutaneous back fat, soleus muscle, EDL and endometria from adult and one-day-old sows) from the 38 tissues were sequenced respectively using PE125 sequencing on the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform to quantify gene/isoform expression. HiSeq library was constructed using NEB kit. Briefly, poly(A) + RNA transcript was isolated from the total RNA (1 µg). Libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB #E7530).2.4 Subread processing and error correctionEffective subreads were obtained using the P_Fetch and P_Filter function (parameters: minSubReadLength =50, readScore =0.75 and minLength =50) in the SMRT Analysis Software v2.3 Suite (http://www.pacb.com/devnet/). The FL transcript sequence was obtained using ToFU pipeline23 (Fig. 1a). Briefly, circular consensus (CCS) read was obtained from the P_CCS module using the parameter MinFullPasses =2 and MinPredictedAccuracy =0. After examining for poly(A) signal, 5' and 3' adaptors, only the CCS with all three signals was considered a FL non-chimetric (FLNC) read.24 To improve consensus accuracy, we used an isoform-level clustering algorithm, namely, iterative clustering for error correction (ICE), and polished FL consensus sequences from ICE using Quiver with the following cut-off criteria: isoform length >200; high-quality >0.99. Additional nucleotide errors in FLNC reads were corrected using the Illumina RNA-seq data with the software Proovread25 using the parameter coverage of 127. The untrimmed sequence was regarded as the result of error correction. Illustration of methods. (a) Iso-Seq workflow for data processing (ToFU). (b) Mapping of PacBio data.

The best mapped locus was selected for each FLNC read based on both identity and coverage values. Genome mapping results of FLNC reads were visualized using the Integrative Genome Viewer.27 The high percent of identity (PID) aligned FLNC reads were used to annotate loci and isoform. For loci, two sequences, which overlapped 20% and at least one overlapping exon to more than 20%, were identified as the same loci transcript. For isoform, single-exon sequence with overlap was determined as the same isoform. Such sequence can be identified as the same isoform when all the splicing sites of the multiple-exon sequences were identical. The redundant and false positive gene structure was removed as follows: (i) the missing 5' end was removed; the sequence structure was a subset of other sequences (sequence structure refers to the ordered sets of all remaining cleavage sites, excluding the initiation and termination sites); the 5' last exon spanning the intron region was determined, and the sequence was retained when it spanned the intron region; (ii) region PID <99: each transcript model kept at least two PacBio sequences; otherwise, all junctions of this sequence were annotated or supported by the junction of second-generation sequencing and (iii) the longest one was retained when the structure of two sequences was the same.2.6 Novel isoformThe gene structure annotation results were compared with those of reference annotation to determine the new gene following these criteria: (1) results showed no overlap or overlapped by less than 20% of the annotated gene site, or (2) the gene overlap was more than 20%, but the gene direction was not consistent. The criteria used for a single transcript to identify novel isoform were as follows: (i) the final splice site of 3' end changed and (ii) new intron or new exon emerged (Fig. 1d).2.7 Alternative splicing classificationThe relative importance of the main models of AS28 and the comprehensive distribution of AS structure in pig transcriptome were ascertained using Astalavista.29 Astalavista was also used for the classification analysis of splice type for the gene model after removing redundancy, and the simplified model constructed by IBS was visualized.302.8 Methylation data analysisMethylome data from our research group (the GEO accession is GSE92417) were remapped to the pig genome assembly, and the methylation levels were calculated as previously reported.18 Briefly, all splice junctions from PacBio Iso-Seq transcripts were stacked (50 bp exon +50 bp intron for donor and 50 bp intron +50 bp exon for acceptor). The methylation level of each base pair was calculated as C/(C + T). The methylation of the donor site was calculated from the first nucleotide of both strands on 5' end of the intron as C/(C + T). The methylation of the acceptor site was calculated from the last nucleotide of both strands on the 3' end of the intron using the same formula. For lncRNA and non-lncRNA methylations, three regions were used for methylation study: 5 kb upstream transcription start site (TSS), transcript body and 5 kb downstream transcription termination site (TTS). Each region was divided into 100 bins. Each methylation ratio was calculated from the corresponding bins from all genes.2.9 Fusion transcript identificationThe criteria used to identify candidate fusion transcripts for a single transcript were as follows (Fig. 1e): (i) FLNC transcript mapped to two or more annotation loci in the genome; (ii) each mapped locus must align with at least 10% of the transcript; (iii) the combined alignment coverage must be at least 99%; (iv) each mapped locus must be at least 10 kb apart and (v) a certain amount of Illumina reads should support the fusion regions.2.10 LncRNA identification from PacBio dataLncRNA identification was performed as previously reported.18 The known high-confidence 27,692 long non-coding RNA transcript sequences and 94,359 protein-coding transcript sequences of human downloaded from GENCODE (Release 25, GRCh38.p7) were used to build the model using PLEK.31 All PacBio isoforms were predicted on the basis of the model. The open reading frames (ORFs) of candidate lncRNAs were predicted by EMBOSS (http://emboss.bioinformatics.nl/). The transcripts encoding ORFs that were longer than 100 amino acids were filtered. The remaining transcripts were further screened by BLASTX (e-value =1e-10) against protein sequences of all species from NR database. Finally, Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLASTN) was used to eliminate the previously discovered lincRNAs of pig in ALDB32 under a criterion of e-value of =1e-10, min-identity of 90% and min-coverage of 85%.2.11 Identification of tissue-specific and period-specific PacBio isoforms by Illumina dataIsoforms detected by PacBio was used as the template combined with the Illumina data to detect the junction of different tissue and period for multi-exon isoforms of Iso-Seq data. We used a new modified GFF file to estimate the expression level of each isoforms. The new GFF file contained junction positions of each isoform which were extracted from the GMAP mapping data. The expressed junction information was obtained as follows: the Illumina raw reads were under the quality control by ng_QC (in-house software of Frasergen Bioinformatics Inc., Wuhan, China) with parameters read_len 125 and default settings for other parameters. Then, the clean paired reads were aligned to the pig genome sequence using TopHat2.1.033 following these options: G—library-type fr-first strand. When all the junctions of one isoform were supported by the Illumina data, it was defined as an expressed isoform (with ‘1’) in the corresponding period or tissue. Conversely, when no Illumina data supported the junction of the Iso-Seq data, or the junction was only partially supported by the Illumina data, it was defined as an unexpressed isoform (with ‘0’) in the corresponding period or tissue. In addition, the read counts for expressed genes were calculated with the HTSeq-count software34 and the differential expression level of genes were determined using GFOLD35 with the default parameters.2.12 Validation of isoforms by RT-PCRWe randomly selected 13 isoforms including AS, novel gene, lncRNA and fusion gene for experimental validation. Transcript-specific primers were designed to span the predicted splicing events based on FL sequences using Primer-BLAST (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/primer-blast/; Supplementary Table S13). PCR amplification was monitored on 1.5% agarose gel and followed by Sanger sequencing. The 18srRNA was amplified as an endogenous control.3. Results3.1 Pig transcriptome by PacBio Iso-SeqShort-read sequencing from the Illumina platform is effective in qualifying gene expression and detecting AS events. However, its capacity to accurately detect FL splice variants of genes is limited.36 To avoid underestimating isoform diversity, pig transcriptomes were sequenced using the PacBio Iso-Seq platform. This platform can provide long reads often up to several transcript lengths, thus the acquisition of accurately reconstructed FL splice variants is possible. To identify as many transcripts as possible, high-quality total RNA was extracted from 38 tissues at two different developmental stages. The method for detecting FLNC, new AS and fusion transcripts was depicted in the flow chart shown in Figure 1.SMRT bell libraries were constructed and sequenced on the PacBio RSII using the latest P6-C4 chemistry with 20 SMRT cells. In total, we detected 1,898,155 polymerase reads representing more than 36 G bases, with a mean length of ~12 kb (Supplementary Table S1). After processing raw data by ToFU pipeline (Fig. 1a), we obtained 14,868,653 filtered subread data with a mean length of 2,596 bp (Supplementary Table S2) and 1,300,544 CCS reads with average depth of 6–10 passes in three libraries (median, Fig. 2a). Then CCS reads were classified into five types as follows: with 5' adaptor, with 3' adaptor, with poly-A tail, FL and FLNC (Fig. 1b and c). We detected 517,462 FL reads [containing 5' and 3' cDNA synthesis primers and a distinct poly(A) tail], of which 99.46% (514,659/517,462) were defined as FLNC (Table 1). Interestingly, we found that only 1.10% (2,254/206,756) FLNCs were <1 kb in length in 0.6–1 kb library (Supplementary Table S3), indicating that swine FL transcripts might be more than 1 kb in length while short fragments mainly consisted of non-coding RNAs with a single exon. Thus, future research on FL transcript can mainly focus on longer than 0.6 kb reads. By analysing the distribution of transcripts’ length, we found that PacBio data set could retrieve much longer transcripts than those described in the current SSC10.2 reference annotations (Fig. 2b).

After correction, we obtained 389,781 high-quality FLNC for further study (Supplementary Table S4).3.2 Isoform detection and characterizationTo evaluate the density and length of isoforms, we compared the loci coverage of PacBio FLNC and swine SSC 10.2 annotation. In PacBio data set, a total of 389,781 high-quality FLNCs covered 77,075 isoforms and were allocated to 39,940 loci (Supplementary Table S5). About 96.65% (38,604/39,940) gene transcripts were =1 kb in length. In reference annotation, 30,585 isoforms covered 25,322 loci and only 58.72% (14,872/25,322) gene transcripts were =1 kb. Our unique isoforms covered about 51.57% (13,059/25,322) of reference annotation loci. In addition, out of 77,075 isoforms, 29,992 (38.91%) were single-exon isoforms and 47,083 (61.09%) were multiple-exon isoforms. Approximately 8,830 loci could produce more than one transcript, accounting for a total of 45,695 isoforms (Fig. 3a). In contrary, in reference annotation, around half (51.57%, 13,059/25,322) could be detected in Iso-Seq reads, of which only 8,062 genes (~61.74%) could produce at least two splice isoforms (Fig. 3b). The gene ACTA1 (gene ID: 14.1882, chr14: 65, 236, 181-65, 239 and 183) had the largest number of isoforms ~337, which played a vital role in the development of skeletal muscle myofibrils in pig.37 Thus, PacBio FLNC data set provided higher isoform density and longer isoform length than SSC 10.2 annotation, which would be propitious to unveil the comprehensive assessment of the true complexity of the transcriptome for the gene structure annotation.20Distribution of genes that produce splice isoform and AS event with different models.

Considering the preferable integrity of the FLNC at the 3' end based on the characteristics of library construction, gene structure integrity of FLNC was only estimated at the 5' end of the sequence. After removing redundancies and false positives, a total of 237,580 FLNC (~85.51%) contained the same initial splice site sequences with the reference annotation, covering 29,036 isoforms (~68.34%, Supplementary Table S6). Moreover, a total of 14,792 FLNC isoforms from 6,105 genes maintained the same structures as annotation, which is similar to previous report that ~1,4000 FL personal transcripts from complement of a pooled set of 20 human organs and tissues in a single-molecule level.20The published pig genome annotation contains ~25,322 gene models with 30,585 isoforms. In PacBio data set, 26,881 unique transcript clusters did not overlap with any annotated gene, which likely originated from novel genes (Supplementary Table S7). Even so, about 13,000 known loci (32.70%) could be mapped to 12,278 reference annotated genes (48.49% of the 25,322 gene). Thus, Iso-Seq data displayed a good example that one gene was annotated to produce a single transcript but was found to generate four splice variants (Supplementary Fig. S1a). Novel annotation of Iso-Seq could rectify the incorrect position annotation of exon of the reference (Supplementary Fig. S1b). Novel genes have emerged as a new structure and filled the blank position without annotation (Supplementary Fig. S1c).Gene annotation for the 26,881 new loci showed that 23,712 loci were single-exon loci and 3,169 were multiple-exon loci (Supplementary Table S7). To validate the unannotated novel loci, we searched these 26,881 new genes in NR, KOG, KO and GO databases using BLASTX (e-value =1e-5). It showed that 10,299 (38.31%), 800 (2.98%), 1,567 (5.83%) and 2,803 (10.43%) of 26,881 new genes could be found in NR, KOG, KO and GO databases, respectively. A total of 417 novel genes had significant hits in the four databases (Fig. 4). At the same time, a large number of unannotated single-exon genes might contain some non-coding RNAs, because coding genes usually had multiple exons which were overwhelmingly alternatively spliced.10,38Novel genes identified in Iso-seq data.

The number represents novel genes identified in NR, KOG, KO and GO databases.3.4 Various types of alternative splicingAS is an important mechanism of generating regulatory function for trait expression of eukaryotes.39 Through alternative recognition of exon and splice site during splicing, a single gene can generate functionally distinct mRNA and diverse protein isoforms. AS formation has five basic types as follows (Fig. 3c): exon skipping (ES), intron retention (IR), mutually exclusive exons (MEE), alternative donor site (AD) and alternative acceptor site (AA). Previously, ~30% of porcine genes were reported to undergo AS using ESTs.7 In this study, we explored a more comprehensive formation and distribution of AS event in pig. In reference annotation, a total of 7.77% (1,967/25,322) genes corresponding to 17.45% (5,336/30,585) isoforms experienced 5,417 AS events (2.71 isoforms and 2.75 AS in each gene). In contrary, 17.66% loci (7,053/39,940 loci) corresponding to 42.38% (32,662/77,075) isoforms underwent 97,727 AS events in PacBio data set (4.63 isoforms and 13.86 AS in each gene, Fig. 3d, Supplementary Table S8). This result indicated that the prevalence of AS event was much higher than previously thought. Interestingly, five basic AS models only accounted for 21.42% (20,930/97,727) of AS events. IR predominated, accounting for 10.16% of alternative transcripts, while MEE (0.34%) was the least frequent. More AS events evolved from combinations of five basic patterns. For example, IR event could appear in different sites within a gene, AA event might be more prone to the 3' terminal exon and ES event would appear in different combinations (Supplementary Fig. S1d–f).On whole-genome level, 1,150 AS models in reference annotation and 7,132 models in Iso-Seq reads were detected (Fig. 5). In contrary, by removing the duplication among different chromosomes, 97,727 AS events with 2,637 models in PacBio Iso-Seq data were identified, of which more than 92,000 were new AS events with 2,100 modes (Fig. 3d). In detail, GANS gene has the largest number of splice variants (~23 transcripts) in present reference annotation. However, we found 35 novel transcripts for GANS gene in Iso-Seq data, which implied a more complex imprinted expression pattern closely related to tumour therapy.40 Moreover, ACTA1 gene expressed only one annotated transcript in reference but exhibited 337 splice variants in our analysis. Its specific expression in muscle provides therapeutic strategies for thin filament myopathy patients41 and a method for improving muscle mass in livestock.42 These results suggested that AS events were severely underestimated in present pig genome annotations.

To detect whether such a situation existed in other species, we downloaded reference annotations of six species, including horse, cattle, sheep, human, mouse and pig, from ensemble (release-84, ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-84/gtf/) for AS analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2). In other five species, correlation coefficient between the number of AS events and gene numbers was very high (r = 0.83–0.94). However, the correlation coefficient in pig from reference annotation was fairly low (r = 0.35), which was similar to the results in Iso-Seq data (r = 0.49). The number of AS events did not significantly grow with the increase of the number of genes on chromosome in pig, indicating that a species specificity was presented on the pig.3.5 DNA methylation regulates alternative splicing variationGiven that exons are often more highly methylated than introns,43,44 DNA methylation is often considered as a strong marker for exon–intron (EI) boundaries during splicing.45,46 The large number of isoforms identified via long-read sequencing in this work provided a good opportunity to investigate the relationship between DNA methylation and AS. To determine whether methylation level is related to AS, DNA methylation level of various isoforms was investigated. We stacked all splice junctions of the PacBio isoforms and measured the methylation levels of three types of cytosines on both strands in each methylation context at donor and acceptor sites. The results revealed that CHG methylation was enriched in acceptor sites, whereas CG methylation was elevated at donor sites (Fig. 6a–c). The CHH and CHG methylation levels were extremely low, whereas CG methylation predominated in pig. This result was consistent with a previous study that three types of methylated motif existed in plants, whereas more CG methylation existed in vertebrates.47 Simultaneously, we found that methylation levels of the longest transcripts were consistent with the methylation of all transcripts. The methylation levels at splice sites did not change significantly with the increase of the number of isoforms (Fig. 6d–f). However, we discovered that CG methylation levels dropped sharply (at least 10 times) at splice sites and then quickly increased in the range of sense strand with 3 bp and antisense strand with 2 bp [both EI and intron–exon (IE)] (Fig. 7a). The tremendous changes might be closely related to AS. Level of DNA methylation at splice sites (exon–intron, intron–exon). (a)–(c): For each row, level of DNA methylation, combing sense and antisense strand, on the sense strand, on the antisense strand.

In (b), (c) and (d), type a: one isoform; type b: 2–10 isoforms; type c: more than 10 isoforms.Previous research reported that the CG locus in the genome was highly methylated and the methylation of CpG islands in the promoter region of the gene could regulate gene expression.47 To determine whether the methylation level of gene was related to the number of isoforms, we divided the isoforms into three groups as follows: type a, genes with only one isoform; type b, genes with two to ten isoforms and type c, genes with more than 10 isoforms. Gene methylation was divided into upstream region (promoters encompass 2 kb upstream of the transcriptional start site), gene body and downstream region. Interestingly, CG methylation of promoter was negatively correlated with number of isoforms, suggesting that a high level of CG methylation at promoter region repressed AS and gene expression (Fig. 7b). Some evidence proved that the region near the promoters of many active genes tended to be unmethylated.48 We also found that the downward trend of methylation level of exon and promoter was insignificant when isoforms were more than 10. To determine whether the first exon was affected by CG methylation, we analysed the relationship between CG methylation of the first exon and the number of isoforms. These results showed that AS was negatively correlated with CG methylation of the first exon, suggesting that a low level of CG methylation at first exon could promote AS formations (Fig. 7c). Furthermore, we determined whether the number of isoforms was affected by the gene length. The results showed that the longer the gene, the more isoforms were produced, but the produced isoforms would be stable when the number of isoforms arrived at a certain level (Fig. 7d). The results showed that AS was not correlated with the number of genes on chromosome in pig but was closely linked to gene length and promoter methylation.3.6 Fusion isoform identification and characterizationA fusion gene was an aberrant gene formed by the concatenation of two separate genes. Long-read alignments can actually determine the EI structure of fusion genes. In this study, we identified 711 isoforms and they could simultaneously cover two or more annotated genes (Supplementary Table S9). The 711 fusion isoforms corresponded to 269 FLNC fusion loci and were involved in 622 genes in the reference annotation. Distribution of fusion isoforms revealed that most of the fusion isoforms were present on chr7, followed by chr14 and chr6 (Fig. 5). In 269 FLNC fusion loci, 31 chimeric genes (~11.52%) corresponding to 90 fusion isoforms (~12.66%) originated from at least three candidate genes, whereas the remaining from two candidate ones. Previous studies showed that fusion events were mostly comprised of two genes.49 However, our results revealed that fusion event was not limited to two genes and could include more than two genes, or even ncRNAs. For example, MT.3.1 originated from 10 candidates (MT-CO2; MT_tRNA; MT-ATP8; MT-ATP6; MT-CO3; MT-tRNA; MT-ND3; MT-tRNA; MT-ND4L; MT-ND4;). MT-CO2 is usually unexpressed and has the characteristic of inducible expression. Once the transcript originates from MT-CO2 expression, it can induce tumour occurrence50 and increase the probability of inducing tumour in females.51 Moreover, fusion event could not only span two distinct genes but also produce variant isoforms with AS events. For example, fusion isoform 11.112 originated form two genes (EXOSC8-ENSSSCG00000026613) and acquired another two novel exons (Supplementary Fig. S1g). This result was consistent with previously reported results that FL fusion could produce fusion genes that acquired novel genes or exons, suggested their isoforms independent of a reference annotation library.49 Thus, fusion isoforms identified by Iso-Seq would provide more direct evidence for further studies of aberrant transcription which were from trans-splicing of distinct genes or splicing of fusion genes formed by from genome rearrangements.To test whether these fusion events were formed stochastically by abnormal AS or necessarily by functional requirement, we analysed the functional relationship between precursor genes and each fusion isoform (Supplementary Table S9). After excluding unannotated genes, we obtained 539 fusion isoforms and 352 precursor genes. Interestingly, we found that a majority of fusion isoforms (397/539,73.65%) were formed from the combinations of separate precursor transcripts in a same gene family. For example, 58 isoforms were from different duplicates of the Myosin heavy chain gene family (MYH), 18 isoforms from DEAD-box helicase family (DDX) and 15 isoforms from interferon induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats family (IFIT). Thus, fusion isoforms from a same gene family implied that the formation of fusing events were likely due to special biological functions such as functional conserved between conserved duplicates or functional complementation between subfunctional duplicates. For other fusion isoforms that originated from different family genes, precursor transcripts of which were probably functionally related. For example, a fusion gene 7.1323 originated from two precursor transcripts (ATP6V1G2 and DDX39B). DDX39B encodes a member of the DEAD box family of RNA-dependent ATPases that mediates adenosine triphosphate (ATP) hydrolysis during pre-mRNA splicing.52 The fusion gene 7.1323 could produce 17 fusion isoforms in pigs while it only produced two transcripts in humans and might induce immunologic and infectious diseases.53Moreover, we perform a more precise BLAST analysis using 711 fusion isoforms against NCBI Reference RNA Sequences database to validate fusion isoforms. Results showed that, 270 fusion genes (~38%) are supported by at least one Reference RNA Sequences in pig (with identity >95% and overlap >90%). In addition, we searched these fusion genes in human. Interestingly, 86 are supported by at least one Reference RNA Sequences (with identity >88% and overlap >90%). And 84 fusion genes were both supported in these two databases, suggested that fusion gene may exist in different species and evolve conserved functions (Supplementary Table S9).3.7 Tissue-specific and period-specific isoformIdentification of specific isoform is among the primary analysis accomplished through Illumina RNA-seq data of the same eight tissues. We used a new modified GFF file to estimate the expression level of each isoforms (Supplementary Table S10). The new GFF file contained junction positions of each isoform which were extracted from the GMAP mapping data. We obtained more than 4 G bases clean paired data each tissue, which was adequate for quantify gene expression (Supplementary Table S11). Additionally, rarefaction analysis revealed that sequencing depth had reached saturation of gene and isoform discovery in each tissue (Supplementary Fig. S3a and b). STEM54 expression analysis for the 39,940 loci revealed that 25,018 loci were expressed in eight tissues. Moreover, about 46.25% (12,432/26,881) of novel gene loci and 48.45% (4,282/8838) of lncRNA could be validated from these eight tissues (Supplementary Table S12).For detecting the tissue-specific expressed isoform, a total of 47,083 multi-exon isoforms were analysed in different tissues and periods (Fig. 8). Uniquely expressed isoforms were 451 in subcutaneous fat of back (SFB), 416 in SM, 341 in EDL and 1,337 in EN respectively, and 16,501 isoforms were simultaneously expressed in the four tissues (Fig. 9a). For the 2,545 isoforms uniquely expressed in each tissue, GO terms were primarily (top six) related to cellular and single-organism processes, cell, cell part, metabolic process, binding (Fig. 9b). Function enrichments of pathway (Fig. 9c) varied slightly in each tissue such as catabolism and carbohydrate metabolism in SFB; digestive system and lipid metabolism in SM; sorting and degradation and digestive system in EDL and endocrine system, immune system and transport and catabolism in EN. These results showed that genes played the same biological functions in different tissues by the same or unique isoforms and the isoforms with tissue specificity might lead to various roles via different pathways.

(c) Classification of KEGG pathways annotation for isoform uniquely expressed in the four tissues.For the period-specific expressed isoforms, 47,083 multi-exon isoforms were classified into five categories (Table 2). A total of 14,706 and 12,766 isoforms simultaneously expressed in four tissues in one-day-old and adult period, respectively (Supplementary Figs S4a and S5a). The number of isoforms expressed only in single tissue between one-day-old and adult also maintained high consistency (r = 0.974). Results from GO and Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) analyses of the isoforms expressed only in single tissue between one-day-old and adult revealed that the tissue diversity of the expression abundance could promote varieties of protein, although GO terms were similar (Supplementary Figs S4b and c and S5b and c). For example, isoform 12.550.1 (TUSC5) showed specific and high expression in SF adult period, which could regulate insulin-mediated adipose tissue glucose uptake by modulation of GLUT4 recycling.55 Isoform 3.161.1 (COX6A2), 12.685.1(MYH13) and 13.197.8 (XIRP1), with specific and high expression in SM and EDL adult period, could play important roles in skeletal muscle fibre type switch,56 immune-mediated myositis57 and muscle development,58 respectively. Analysis of period-specific isoformsAnalysis of period-specific isoforms3.8 LncRNA identificationA classification model of a high-confidence set of known lncRNAs was built using PLEK31 to identify lncRNAs in the PacBio data. Among the 77,075 PacBio isoforms, 15,049 candidate lncRNAs were obtained via PLEK model. To obtain a high-confidence set of lncRNA genes, we eliminated transcripts with ORFs exceeding 100 codons and used BLASTX to screen the 15,049 candidates for homology with proteins of all species in NR data, thereby obtaining 8,838 lncRNAs with a mean length of 2 kb. Of the 8,838 lncRNAs, including 7,928 single-exon lncRNAs (89.7%) and 910 multi-exon lncRNAs (10.3%), 5,058 lincRNAs existed. BLASTN found that 664 of the 5,058 candidates corresponded to previously reported lincRNA of pig in ALDB.32 The remaining 4,394 novel lincRNAs had a mean length of 2.024 kb (Fig. 10a). LncRNAs were classified into five groups according to their biogenesis positions relative to protein-coding genes of SSC10.2.84 annotations: 57.23% of them were generated from intergenic regions, 31.81% from the intronic regions, 7.24% from the sense strand, 3.33% from the antisense strand and 0.40% belong to bidirectional lncRNA (Fig. 10b). In addition, majority (89.7%) of the lncRNAs were single exon, and this percentage was significantly higher than the non-lncRNAs (P < 0.01, Fig. 10c). Characters of identified lncRNAs.

(h) Comparison of overall expression between single-exon lncRNAs and multi-exon lncRNAs. (i) Comparison of DNA methylation level on lncRNAs and non-lncRNAs.A total of 388 lncRNAs were simultaneously expressed in the eight tissues. Endometria at adult expressed the most specific lncRNAs (132), whereas adult soleus muscle expressed the fewest (9) (Fig. 10d). Heatmap of lncRNA and non-lncRNA expression confirmed that both lncRNA and non-lncRNA unfolded tissue-specific expression, particularly in SFB_A, EN_A and EN_B (Fig. 10e and f). Comparison of overall expression between lncRNA and non-lncRNA showed that lncRNA were significantly less expressed than non-lncRNA (P < 0.01, Fig. 10g). Comparison revealed that multi-exon lncRNAs expressed a higher level than single-exon lncRNAs (Fig. 10h). Furthermore, we monitored the level of CG methylation within and surrounding (5 kb upstream and 5 kb downstream) lncRNA and non-lncRNA isoforms (Fig. 10i). DNA methylation decreased near the TSS and TTS of both lncRNA and non-lncRNA genes; DNA methylation was also particularly significant for the TSS of non-lncRNA genes (P < 0.01). Non-lncRNA genes presented higher CG methylation within the gene body than lncRNAs, whereas lncRNAs showed higher methylation level at upstream and downstream regions than non-lncRNAs. Finally, we discovered that multi-exon lncRNAs exhibited higher CG methylation within the gene body and the lower level at upstream and downstream regions than single-exon lncRNAs. DNA methylation of the promoter and gene body was strongly correlated with lncRNA expression,59 which might reflect the diverse expression levels of non-lncRNA genes and lncRNAs, as well as that of single-exon and multi-exon isoforms.3.9 Validation of isoforms by RT-PCRTo verify the expression of novel isoforms and genes in eight tissues, we randomly selected six genes (with or without exons and with or without AS) and performed reverse transcription (RT) PCR following by Sanger sequencing (primers listed in Supplementary Table S13). As shown in Figure 11, expression and splicing were confirmed in our expression analysis. In addition, two fusion transcripts (7.168.3 and 1.2355.7) and two transcripts of novel lncRNAs (1.1171.1 and x.631.1) were randomly selected and experimentally validated. The results confirmed the authenticity of two chimeric RNA and tow lncRNAs. The validation above also showed that AS and fusion isoforms had differential expression and tissue and period specificity, thus increasing diversity of gene regulation as well as complexity of transcriptome.

DiscussionIn this work, we applied PacBio sequencing technique to investigate transcripts, provided the first comprehensive view of splice variants in pig and illustrated the advantage of Iso-Seq in identifying FL splice isoforms. Following the latest methodologies in analysing PacBio transcriptome data, we obtained 389,781 high-quality FLNC reads, with 77,075 isoforms covering 39,940 loci, 97,727 AS events corresponding to 2,637 models, 711 fusion isoforms and 4,394 novel lincRNAs that were not previously annotated in pig. The new resource and transcriptional information would be of great value to improve pig genome annotation and livestock transcriptome research.This experimental design aimed at maximizing transcript diversity and investigating comprehensive splice isoforms by broadly sampling 38 tissues and organs. Compared with previous studies, this experiment by far used the most number of tissues to comprehensively research transcriptome isoform via SMRT methodology.20 Twenty cells in our study might not well uncover more low-abundance isoforms, but the data depth was adequate to explore as many FL splice isoforms as possible when depending on the porcine genome size and comparing with previous similar studies of SMRT transcriptomes.18,20,22 In this study, only 0.6% of FLNCs was excavated in the 0–600 bp library, indicated that swine FL transcript might be more than 1 kb in length and short fragments mainly consisted of non-coding RNAs with a single exon. Thus, future research on FL transcript can mainly focus on longer than 0.6 kb reads.AS plays important roles in regulating molecular, cellular, physiological and developmental processes/pathways in eukaryotes.60 However, the difficulty of identifying the combinations of splice-site usage by Illumina short reads limits gene model prediction. Previous studies show that ~30% of genes were alternatively spliced in pig, compared with 68% in humans, 57% in mouse and 21% in bovine.7,11 Our analysis shows that ~17.66% loci (7,053/39,940) are alternatively spliced, and ~42.38% (32,662/77,075) transcripts are associated with AS in Iso-Seq data, while only 7.77% (1,967/25,322) genes corresponding to 17.45% (5,336/30,585) isoforms are in pig reference annotation. Thus, a large of AS gene identified in this study will greatly improve reference annotation. Relatively, gene proportion of AS in Iso-Seq data is low, owing to slightly high single-exon isoform with little coding capacity and thus may represent lncRNAs.20 Furthermore, 7,051 multi-exon genes (99.97%) are alternatively spliced in Iso-Seq data, which was consistent with previous reports on humans,10 confirming that almost all multi-exon genes undergo AS to increase transcriptome diversity.Hypothetically, variations in the EI methylation dynamics may result in ES. In fact, alternative exon recognition mechanisms may have evolved in genes with equal exon-to-intron DNA methylation ratios, and this phenomenon is one of the biological explanations given for the variation in AS patterns between species.61,62 Interestingly, DNA methylation is enriched in AS sites and splicing regulatory motifs.63 We found that DNA methylation enriching in AS sites varied from acceptor to donor sites and from sense strand to antisense strand. The trend of CG methylation is not as significant like that in plant, revealing that CG methylation promoted AS.18 The sharp decline of cytosine coverage of EI and IE structure sites indicated that the change of cytosine content at 2–3 bp around the AS sites caused the change of methylation level and affected the occurrence of AS events. This finding provides evidence for the methylation of AS events depending on the structure of the AS sites. Moreover, our results revealed that CG methylation in promoter region repressed AS and regulated the first exon and that methylation of first exon also repressed AS in pig. Alternative first exon affected by the usage of alternative promoter was found to result in mRNA isoforms with distinct 5' UTRs.8 This phenomenon indicates that promoter methylation can enhance the first exon to repress the AS events in animals.In this study, we identified 8,838 high-confidence lncRNA, including 4,394 novel lincRNA in pig. Owing to the lack of a good database, we constructed the PLEK model using human data, which included the most complete lncRNAs. Relatively, media length of lncRNA in pig (2,024 bp) was only half of that of human (4,096 bp). ~90% of the lncRNAs belonging to the single exon confirmed that candidate genes with few introns showed little coding capacity and thus might represent lncRNAs, and isoforms with more introns corresponded to known (mostly protein coding) genes.20 The expression of lncRNA is usually low, and we speculate that one reason is that lncRNAs with little exons rarely occur AS events. Consistent with previous work, we uncovered a high degree of tissue specificity among lncRNAs, a feature shared by other animals.64,65 In addition, we discovered that multi-exon lncRNAs expressed a higher level than single-exon lncRNAs. Methylation levels of the lncRNA genomic regions were significantly higher than that for the mRNA genes.66 Meanwhile, our work found that methylation levels of lncRNAs were higher than non-lncRNAs in the upstream region of TSS and downstream region of TTS, whereas non-lncRNAs with higher methylation levels existed in gene body. This phenomenon also appeared in single-exon and multi-exon lncRNAs, indicating that gene with high expression or coding capacity corresponds with low methylation level in TSS and TTS. However, high methylation level in gene body needs future research.Overall, our study demonstrates that long-read sequencing complements short-read sequencing for cataloguing and quantifying eukaryotic transcripts. Based on FL transcripts, a large number of AS models and isoforms provide a more comprehensive foundation to explore transcriptome diversity. Our results revealed the unique species specificity of AS, the rule of fusion event, the specificity of isoform, the difference of lncRNA, the DNA methylation regulation on AS and lncRNA. These results not only significantly improve existing gene models of pig, but have revealed important rules and generated novel resource and information with positive implications for agricultural production or disease prevention.4.1 Availability of data and materialThe sequence data reported in this paper have been deposited in the Genome Sequence Archive (GSA; http://gsa.big.ac.cn/) of Beijing Institute of Genomics, Chinese Academy of Sciences, under accession number PRJCA000349.Many thanks to Frasergen Inc.

IntroductionThe information provided by genomes has become invaluable for research fields that deal with animal production, conservation biology or evolution.1 High-density (HD) genetic maps provide information on genome organisation by establishing the cartography of thousands of markers, which can aid to disentangle the genetic architecture of productive or evolutionary traits. Moreover, these maps represent an essential tool for comparative genomics and can facilitate whole genome assembly.2,3 The advent of next generation sequencing (NGS) has dramatically reduced the cost and time required for genomic analysis,4,5 thus contributing to a fast increase of genomic resources. Nevertheless, while DNA sequencing has become an automated task at platforms, genome assembling still relies on the hierarchical ordering of short DNA fragments (contigs, scaffolds), currently being facilitated by the novel long-read assembling approaches (Nanopore, PacBio, Dovetail, Bionano).6 HD genetic mapping can assist the process of genome assembly through positioning and ordering scaffolds or validating bioinformatic assembly.7,8,9 This is a particularly challenging task in teleosts, considering the ancestral teleost-specific whole genome duplication event in this group of fish.10A huge number of markers and samples can now be analysed at very low cost using genotyping by sequencing (GBS) methods,4,5,9 which enables to simultaneously identify and genotype thousands of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across samples. A popular GBS method is Restriction Associated DNA sequencing (RADseq), a technique that combines the power of NGS with the simplification of genomes through restriction enzyme digestion.11–13 RADseq is being increasingly used for the construction of HD genetic maps in fish comprising thousands of markers (e.g. Refs 14–19). These maps have allowed the identification of genomic regions associated with productive traits20,21 or with adaptation to specific environments.14,16 The pattern of samples and families used in fish for map construction has been quite similar, and only very recently, the number of families has increased.19,22 However, when many families have been analysed, the number of offspring per family has been much smaller (e.g. Tsai et al. 201623: 60 families with less than 10 offspring each; Palaiokostas et al. 201624: 75 families with 10 offspring on average). This is a way to achieve a consensus reference map at species level by averaging inter-individual variation, but the low family sampling size can result in suboptimal estimation of inter-marker distances and mapping order.25,26The presence of genomic reorganisations and variation of mapping parameters across individual or sex-specific maps has been hardly addressed to date in fish despite its importance from both evolutionary and practical perspectives. For example, inversions might aid to maintain blocks of coadapted genetic variants at specific environments, such as reported in fish like cod27 or stickleback.7,28 Moreover, sex-specific mapping features are important when tracking markers associated to economically relevant traits since recombination patterns in males and females may differ and thus, they should be considered for accurate evaluations. NGS technologies now enable studying intra-specific variation on genome organisation and recombination with enough depth to improve the analysis of associations with traits of interest. This would aid for a more accurate mining to identify responsible genes and mutations and choose the best strategy for marker assisted selection.The turbot (Scophthalmus maximus) is the main worldwide aquaculture flatfish,9 People’s Republic of China being currently the most important producer (>60,000 tons/year29). Genetic breeding programs in this species began in the 90s. Nowadays, a broad battery of genetic markers and genomic tools are available in turbot, which can aid to understand the genetic basis of the main economically important traits (growth rate, disease resistance, sex control) and for applying a more efficient selection.30–35 The first genetic maps in turbot, based on anonymous or gene-associated microsatellites and SNPs,36–38 were later integrated in a consensus map.38 More recently, a high-density map was reported by Wang et al.,21 but the scarce information provided on genetic marker-associated sequences made it not feasible to integrate with previously reported maps.9 Centromeres have been located in the turbot genetic map using half-tetrad analysis40, and recently, a high coverage draft genome has been assembled and anchored to the reported consensus map.36 Moreover, the development of genomic resources for other important flatfish species41–43 and their integration in a common framework has allowed comparative analyses to transfer genomic information on production-related traits between species and to look for insights into flatfish evolution.9,38In this study, we genotyped 18,214 SNPs using the 2b-RAD technology in 1,268 individuals from 31 turbot full-sibling (sib) families with the aim of: (i) obtaining a robust consensus genetic map for the species; (ii) integrating the genetic and physical maps in a common framework to facilitate transference of segregation data into the physical genome; (iii) refining the turbot genome assembly and comparative mapping with other flatfish; and (iv) assessing the variation in genome organisation and recombination between sexes and individuals. Our results rendered much deeper information on intra-specific mapping variation than previously reported in fish and provided useful integrated genomic resources to understand the architecture of economically important traits for further applications in industrial breeding programs.2. Materials and methods2.1. Families for mappingThe broodstock of CETGA (Aquaculture Cluster of Galicia, Ribeira, Spain), a population representative of turbot from the Atlantic area, was used to found a set of 44 families within the goals of the FISHBOOST project (EU 613611). This project is focused on improving the efficiency and profitability of finfish European aquaculture by fostering selective breeding to a next level, including the application of genomic selection. This goal also involved the refinement and improvement of existing mapping resources and their integration in a common framework within the reported turbot genome assembly.34 The experiment was performed under approval of the ethics committee of CETGA to adjust to animal welfare legislation.A total of 31 full-sib families were selected among the 44 families considering both successful genotyping and informativeness (Fig. 1). The partly factorial mating of 22 males × 22 females performed made available 27, either maternal of paternal, half-sibs families (eight males and nine females contributed to more than one family). A total of 1,224 offspring were used for linkage analysis representing on average 39.5 individuals per family (range: 36–45). Families selected for linkage analysis in S. maximus. Male (M) × female (F) crosses and the number of offspring per family are indicated. Note the presence of several half-sib families sharing the father or the mother.Families selected for linkage analysis in S. maximus.

SNP calling and genotypingGenomic DNA was extracted from fin clips using SSTNE buffer (a TNE buffer modified by adding spermidine and spermine) and a standard NaCl isopropanol precipitation.44 Library preparation followed the 2b-RAD protocol45 slightly modified to include replicated polymerase chain reactions (PCRs) per sample (to reduce PCR duplicate bias) and to quantify DNA sampling before pooling (to increase sample coverage homogeneity). Detailed information about the protocol can be found in Supplementary Material text. Briefly, DNA of each sample was separately digested using AlfI restriction enzyme, adaptors including specific sample barcodes ligated, and the resulting fragments amplified. After PCR purification, samples were merged in pools of 128 samples for sequencing and genotyping the offspring, while the 44 parents were genotyped in a single pool, to increase coverage and genotyping accuracy. A total of 11 pools (1 for the parents and 10 for the offspring) were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq sequencer using a 50 bp single end protocol at BMR Genomics (Padova, Italy).Raw data were demultiplexed at the sequencing facility. All reads were trimmed at 36 bp and centred on the enzyme recognition site. Stacks' process_radtag pipeline46,47 was used to filter raw reads according to sequencing quality. All reads with an uncalled base were removed, and quality was checked using a sliding window of 25% of the sequence length. If the mean quality score of this window dropped below 20, the sequence was removed.Filtered reads were mapped against the turbot genome34 using Bowtie 1.2.048 and allowing a maximum of three mismatches in the first 33 bases. Only a unique match on turbot genome was permitted, otherwise reads were discarded. Mapped reads from parent samples were fed into Stacks' module ref_map.pl using the bounded model with a significance threshold of 0.05 and an upper bound of 0.05. As a further filter, only SNPs genotyped in 80% of the parents with a minimum read depth of 10 reads were retained using the populations module. When a RAD-tag contained more than one SNP, only the first SNP from the 5' end was retained. The set of SNPs obtained from parents was used as a reference for offspring genotyping using the Stacks module sstacks. The obtained dataset (parents and offspring) was further filtered according to population parameters and Mendelian segregation using the 26 most informative families. Those markers showing consistent deviations from Mendelian segregation (P < 0.01) across families or extreme departures from Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) in the parental population (P < 0.001) due to heterozygote excess (FIS < -0.5, P < 0.0001; paralogous genes) or deficit (FIS > 0.5, P < 0.0001; null alleles) were filtered out. Finally, RAD-tags containing SNPs were mapped against the turbot gene catalog38 using Blastn (E-value < e-20) to obtain sequence annotations.2.3. Construction of genetic mapsGenotypes of filtered SNP markers were properly coded as JOINMAP Cross Pollinator (CP) cross type with unknown linkage phase. Markers genotyped in less than 90% of the offspring were excluded for linkage analysis in each family. All genetic maps (individual, family, male consensus, female consensus and species consensus) were constructed using JoinMap 4.1.49 First, markers were associated to their linkage groups (LGs) using the Grouping function of JoinMap based on a series of LOD scores (logarithm of the likelihood ratio that two genes are linked regarding that they segregate independently) increasing by one, from 3 to 10. The LOD score was then selected in each family based on the number of turbot chromosomes (n = 22); in all cases, a LOD > 6.0 was used. Unlinked markers and markers assigned to very small LGs exceeding the haploid number of 22 chromosomes were excluded from further analysis. Second, marker ordering was performed using the Maximum Likelihood algorithm with default parameters, and the recombination frequencies converted into map distances in centi-Morgans (cM) using the Kosambi mapping function. For each family, individual female and male maps, as well as a consensus family map, were generated. Due to computational limitations, only the three most informative families were selected to construct the species consensus, the female consensus and the male consensus maps using MergeMap.50 All maps constructed were drawn using MapChart ver. 2.3.51 In order to investigate the heterogeneity of recombination frequency (RF) between sexes, RFs were extracted from JoinMap analysis. The pattern of RF in the father and the mother could not be straightforwardly compared within each family due to the different panel of informative SNPs; consequently, the set of markers shared between both parents was selected in each family for a detailed evaluation of RF variation between sexes across LGs within each family (heterozygous in both parents with 1:2:1 segregation).2.4. Genetic versus physical map: anchoring scaffolds to linkage groupsThe consensus genetic map was used to refine the turbot genome assembly34 and to obtain a physical map consistent on 22 megascaffolds, representing the complete sequence of each of the 22 LGs of turbot map.32,39 This task implied (i) to assign previously unlinked scaffolds to specific LGs in the new high-dense (HD) genetic map; (ii) to correct scaffold misassemblies by comparing the genetic and physical maps; and (iii) to establish the correct orientation of scaffolds within each megascaffold. All contigs including at least one marker significantly assigned to a LG were anchored in the new map. When markers of a specific scaffold were assigned to more than one LG, the scaffold was split into fragments pertaining to different LGs or to the same LG but in different positions (see Results). To establish the most confident splitting of these scaffolds, we compared the sequence of the gap between the flanking markers assigned to different LGs with the two model fish genomes, Gasterosteus aculeatus and Oryzias latipes, which had demonstrated large synteny with turbot.34,38 Then, we looked for the turbot genes in the gap assigned to different LGs in the model species in order to narrow down as much as possible the gap (Supplementary Fig. S1). Following this approach, the narrowest gap was finally cut in the middle and halves assigned to each LG. Reorganisations were only validated when information was consistent with both model species. To find out the correct order and orientation of scaffolds within LGs, we obtained the average map position of the markers belonging to each scaffold using the maps of the 10 most informative families. Then, we checked for the correlation between the physical position of markers and their genetic position. When the correlation was positive, the original orientation was maintained, and when negative, the reverse complementary sequence of the scaffold was retrieved for assembling.2.5. Integrating genetic and physical maps with cytogenetic dataGenetic and physical maps were then integrated with the turbot cytogenetic map using previous information.32,40,52 Starting from centromere positions40 and considering the relationship between genetic and cytogenetic maps,32 we established the correspondence between LGs, megascaffolds and chromosomes as far as possible. Then, we compared the consensus genetic map of each chromosome with its physical assembly (megascaffold) to assess their correspondence with centromere, telomere and interstitial heterochromatin locations. When no marker was available close to the centromeric region, the closest markers around the centromere were used as reference or, in a few cases, the farthest marker from the centromere was used for its rough location at the other chromosome end, considering the acrocentric morphology of most turbot chromosomes.52 Finally, this comparison was also carried out between sexes using the sex-specific consensus maps, in order to assess RF differences across chromosomes between males and females.2.6. Inter-individual genomic reorganisations in turbotThe availability of 31 family maps and 44 parental maps (Fig. 1), enabled an exhaustive comparison of genetic maps between individuals and sexes to assess inter-individual variation on RF across the genome. This variation, which might be related to chromosome polymorphisms existing in turbot populations, had not been previously addressed in fish with the number of markers and families here evaluated. In order to identify putative genomic reorganisation between individuals, we performed a pair-wise comparison between all parental maps by plotting the positions of each marker. Plots were created with R53 and the different LGs were labelled with different colours for a better visualisation. In order to handle the amount of data obtained, 62 individual maps at 22 LGs (due to half-sib families; Fig. 1), each LG was divided in stretches of 50 SNPs representing ~1.6 Mb on average (e.g. 23 blocks for LG02, the longest LG with 1,132 SNPs). Then, the correlation between the physical and genetic maps was analysed for each block at each individual map in order to identify potential inversions. A heat map was generated to provide a more straightforward view of the results.2.7. Interspecific genomic reorganisations between turbot and other flatfish speciesThe improved turbot genome was further exploited to complete and refine previous information about genomic reorganisations and chromosome evolution of flatfish.9,34 For this, we compared the improved turbot genome with those of Japanese flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus43) and half-smooth tongue sole (Cynoglossus semilaevis42) at chromosome level using LASTZ54 (using options ‘–notransition – step = 400 – nogapped – format = rdotplot’) and compared each turbot chromosome with the orthologues of the other two species. Further, in order to assess the relation between flatfish megascaffolds to a model fish genome outside Pleuronectiformes, an additional LASTZ analysis was carried out with stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) using the same parameters.3. Results3.1. SNP calling, filtering and genotypingA total of 3,946,354,960 reads (3.9 Gb) were produced at the BMR sequencing platform, corresponding to 1,282 individuals represented by 3,078,280 reads on average (range: 312 – 9,610,380). Fourteen offspring were removed due to the low number of usable reads (< 75,000), leaving a total of 1,268 individuals (44 parents and 1,224 offspring) pertaining to 31 full-sib families for subsequent analyses.After quality filtering and alignment to the turbot genome, the average number of reads per sample was 6,663,809 (range: 2,601,955–8,946,621) for parents and 2,774,579 (range: 283,203–5,596,610) for offspring. After Stacks' populations filter, 139,293 RAD-tags were retained, of which 25,511 (18.3%) contained at least one SNP. Since only one SNP was retained per RAD-tag, a total of 25,511 SNPs were considered after eliminating the remaining SNPs in the same RAD-tag (Supplementary Table S1). Among these 25,511 SNPs, 18,214 were finally retained after filtering loci by: (i) consistent deviations from Mendelian segregation (5,866 loci: P < 0.01 in at least two families and representing more than 20% of the informative families); (ii) very low minimum allele frequency in the parental population (< 0.015) suggestive of genotyping errors (991 SNPs); and (iii) extreme deviations from HWE suggesting either paralogous genes (364 loci) or high null allele frequency (91 loci) (Supplementary Table S1). This set of 18,214 SNPs represented a frequency of one SNP every 163 bp in the reduced portion of the genome sequenced with 2b-RAD, a frequency slightly lower than that reported in other studies in turbot,55,56 and a density of one SNP every 31,130 bp in the whole turbot genome (567 Mb34). The average proportion of genotyping errors (Mendelian inconsistencies in families) of our 2b-RAD genotyping approach was 0.68% throughout all families in the filtered SNP dataset.Out of the 18,214 SNPs finally retained, nearly half matched to turbot genes (9,028). Among those lying within exons (834), 400 corresponded to non-synonymous and 430 to synonymous allelic variants (Supplementary Table S1).3.2. Construction of genetic mapsOn average, 5,385 SNPs were used for map construction in each of the 31 families analysed (range: 2,079 in Fam55 to 6,757 in Fam30; Supplementary Table S2). Maps consisted of 22 LGs corresponding to the 22 chromosomes of the turbot haploid karyotype, averaging 140.5 cM and 245 markers per LG and family (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Note that LGs nomenclature follow previous publications32 and accordingly, LG18 is missing due to its merging with LG08 (LG08 + 18, here LG08). LG22 was on average the shortest LG (94.9 cM; range: 28.1 cM in Fam55 to 223.5 in Fam19) and included the lowest number of markers (189.9; range: 56 in Fam16 to 257 in Fam39). LG02 was on average the longest LG (207.7 cM; range: 49.9 cM in Fam59 to 414.0 cM in Fam19) with the highest number of markers (341.7; range: 97 in Fam55 to 457 in Fam39). A total of 17,169 SNPs were successfully mapped at least in one family, 1,045 remaining unmapped. Of the last, 1,029 were located in scaffolds where other markers were anchored to the linkage map and could therefore be assigned to specific LGs. Only 16 SNPs could not be assigned to any LG. Marker interval across all families averaged 0.6 cM and ranged from 0.43 cM in Fam11 to 1.08 cM in Fam19. If unique positions instead of markers were accounted for, marker interval averaged 2.0 cM and ranged from 1.81 in Fam13 cM to 2.74 cM in Fam55.The turbot consensus map constructed with the three most informative families using MergeMap included 11,845 markers distributed over 22 LGs representing a total length of 8,532.6 cM (Supplementary Table S3A; Fig. 2). LG length varied from 282.9 cM (LG22) to 588.7 cM (LG02), with an average length of 387.8 cM. The average marker interval was 0.72 cM and ranged from 0.57 cM in LG01 to 0.89 cM in LG4. Because of the inflated length observed for this consensus map, we also estimated the average LG lengths from the three families used to construct the consensus, as these values represent more realistic lengths than those rendered by the consensus MergeMap algorithm (see Discussion) (Table 1). These LG lengths sum up to 3,753.9 (i.e. an average marker interval of 0.32 cM). Average length and constitution (SNP and scaffold number) of LGs in the species, female and male S. maximus consensus mapsAverage length and constitution (SNP and scaffold number) of LGs in the species, female and male S. maximus consensus mapsConsensus genetic map of S. maximus using the three most informative full-sib families; genetic distance in cM in the left bar; the position of centromeres (C) or genetic markers far from centromere (T) in acrocentric chromosomes are indicated.Consensus genetic map of S. maximus using the three most informative full-sib families; genetic distance in cM in the left bar; the position of centromeres (C) or genetic markers far from centromere (T) in acrocentric chromosomes are indicated.Female and male consensus genetic maps differed significantly totalling 8,274.8 cM and 6,791.6 cM (F:M ratio = 1.22), with average LG length of 376.1 and 308.7 cM, respectively. In both females and males LG02 was the largest LG (545.8 vs 474.9 cM) and LG22 the shortest one (292.1 vs 198.7 cM) (Supplementary Fig. S2). As for the species consensus map, Table 1 reports average LG lengths also for female and male consensus maps.Individual female and male genetic maps (62 in total; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3) were also constructed for a more detailed comparison of RF between individuals and sexes, and to look for putative chromosome polymorphisms in the turbot population (44 parents). The length of female genetic maps was higher than that of male maps in all families and for all LGs (average F:M ratio = 1.36). For a more detailed comparison, 10,168 markers shared between sexes and mapped in at least one family were selected (Supplementary Table S4). As expected, the average inter-marker distance for the same pair of markers was significantly higher in females than in males (2.2 and 1.7 cM, respectively; P < 0.001, t-test for related samples). When F:M intervals were compared at each LG, the difference was significant for all groups excluding LG02, LG17 and LG22 (P > 0.05) (Supplementary Table S4). When F:M intervals were compared across all LGs within each family, again inter-marker distances were higher and significant in females in all but four families (families 16, 22, 47 and 55, P > 0.05; Supplementary Table S4).3.3. Anchoring turbot genetic and physical maps: megascaffoldsScaffolds were assigned to the 22 LGs of the turbot consensus map, then ordered and oriented, thus constituting 22 megascaffolds. Series of 100 Ns were used in the megascaffold sequence to show the gap between adjacent scaffolds denoting missing information. Additionally, the short uncertain regions around the boundaries of split scaffolds were written in lowercase to highlight their lower confidence. The complete nucleotide sequence of the 22 megascaffolds with their correspondent genes located and annotated has been uploaded to NCBI (SUB3239805).A total of 28 scaffolds were split and reallocated according to the very consistent mapping information in all the 31 families analysed (Supplementary Table S5). Most scaffolds (22) were split into two fragments and reallocated to different LGs. In three cases, scaffolds were split in three different LGs (sm5_s00043, sm5_s00056 and sm5_s00084), and in other three cases, the two fragments of the scaffold were reallocated within the same LG (sm5_s00006, sm5_s00007 and sm5_s00049). In all cases, the boundaries of the breakage point were assigned with notable accuracy (Supplementary Fig. S1), and uncertain gap regions averaged 38,010 bp, ranging from 549 bp (sm5_s00086) to 160,155 bp (sm5_s00084) (Supplementary Table S5). Rearranged scaffolds represented a total of 108.5 Mb, to say ~20% of the entire turbot genome.A total of 17,169 SNPs corresponding to 558 scaffolds (after splitting 28) rendered a significant match to the turbot genetic map (Supplementary Table S1). On average each scaffold contained 32.7 SNPs ranging from 610 SNPs in sm5_s00003_17 (LG17) to one SNP in 204 scaffolds. The total length of the anchored sequences was 524,925,810 bp, representing 96.5% of the turbot genome assembly (544 Mb). The average megascaffold length was 23,860,264 bp, ranging from 14,917,408 bp (LG22) to 31,897,078 bp (LG02) (Table 1). Megascaffolds contained on average 827 SNPs (range 578–1144) and 25.4 scaffolds (range 14–46) (Table 1). All scaffolds assigned to chromosomes were consistently ordered within the megascaffold according to the mapping information across families; the orientation within each chromosome could be verified for those 336 that contained at least two informative markers. The remaining 204 scaffolds with only one marker could not be oriented, but they represented a very minor proportion of the total assembly (2.0%) because of their small size. Interestingly, they were mostly located at the end of chromosomes (telomeres), suggesting assembling problems caused by repetitive motifs.3.4. Integrating cytogenetic information: chromosomes vs LGs vs megascaffoldsTurbot genetic, physical and cytogenetic information obtained in this work and from previous studies was integrated as far as possible, and accordingly, a unified nomenclature is proposed in this study (Table 1). Four chromosomes (C1, C2, C3 and C22)34 were unequivocally assigned to specific LGs: the two metacentric C1 (LG02) and C2 (LG16), the submetacentric nucleolus organiser region (NOR)-bearing chromosome C3 (LG15) and the smallest acrocentric chromosome C22 (LG22), constituting the four marker chromosomes identifiable in the turbot karyotype. The remaining megascaffolds, which correspond to acrocentric chromosomes of decreasing size, were termed according to their physical length from C4 to C21 (Table 1).The consensus genetic and physical maps showed a linear correspondence along most chromosome length in all LGs, excluding those regions around centromeres and telomeres (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Fig. S3). A cloud of dots indicative of poor mapping accuracy were observed around most mapped centromeres40 (i.e. LG01, LG10, LG11, LG19 and LG20). Dot clouds were located in intermediate regions of the metacentric chromosomes (LG02 and LG16) or at the terminal regions in the acrocentrics in accordance with their cytogenetic structure. LG15, the NOR-bearing chromosome, showed a moderate dispersion of dots throughout the proximal centromere chromosome half likely related to the tandem rDNA clusters and their associated heterochromatin in that region.52 Also, close to telomeres, although not so markedly, dots were either dispersed (i.e. LG03, LG08, LG11 and LG14) or showing particular drawings (LG02, LG06 and LG15) suggestive of wrong physical assembly or genetic mapping. Finally, the pattern of the acrocentric chromosome C5 (LG04) was remarkable because of the presence of an internal cloud of dots in addition to that associated around the centromere at the chromosome end. This LG very likely correspond to the chromosome 5 of turbot karyotype, which showed an interstitial heterochromatic block with C-banding.52 When the same comparison between genetic and physical maps was performed for the female and male consensus maps, dot clouds around centromeres were very prominent in the male map and subtle, and sometimes inexistent, in the female maps (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S4; i.e. LG01, LG05, LG09, LG15, LG19 and LG22). So, it seems that the length difference between male and female maps is mainly related to the lower recombination rates around centromeres characterising male maps.

Intraspecific chromosome reorganisationsMarker positions showed a good correspondence between the 62 parental genetic maps (including ‘replicates’ from half-sib families) although particular drawings were suggestive of different marker order between individual maps (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S5). The negative correlations between physical and genetic maps at these regions supported this observation, and the presence of putative chromosome rearrangements that involved either single blocks (50 SNPs, ~1.6 Mb) or longer chromosome tracts was identified (Supplementary Fig. S6). Inverted single blocks were very frequent at LG02 (blocks 7 and 23), LG05 (block 12), LG08 (block 2), LG13 (blocks 14 and 15) and LG22 (block 12), while larger inverted chromosome tracts were observed in some individuals at LG06 (blocks 5–9) and LG09 (blocks 13–16) (Supplementary Figs S5 and S6). However, these putative inversions, particularly those related to single blocks, were found close to telomeres or centromeres, where mapping accuracy is poorer both due to assembling problems and to the lower ratio of genetic/physical distance. This suggests that they are more likely related to technical devices than to true reorganisations. Otherwise, the longer tracts observed at LG06 and LG09 were located at interstitial regions, and thus, signatures of inversions should be more consistent.

Interspecific chromosome reorganisationsThe whole turbot megascaffold sequences were aligned against the genomes of Japanese flounder and tongue sole using the LASTZ program and a 1:1 macrosyntenic pattern was observed (Supplementary Fig. S7A and B), as reported previously.9 However, some Robertsonian translocations (fusions or fissions) and other minor inter-chromosomal rearrangements were observed. The most notable cases when comparing turbot (n = 22) and Japanese flounder (n = 24) genomes were the correspondence of turbot LG02 with Japanese flounder Chr06 and Chr14 (Fig. 5A) and that of LG16 with Chr09 and Chr16 (Supplementary Fig. S7A). In the same way, turbot LG02 was related to tongue sole Chr13 and Chr14 (Fig. 5B), which suggests that LG02 fusion is a derived condition (apomorphy) in the turbot lineage. The position of turbot centromeres at LG02 was the expected one if a centric fusion between two chromosomes had occurred in the turbot lineage (Fig. 5), as also occurred for LG16 (Supplementary Fig. S7A). These chromosome fusions, starting from the ancestral teleost karyotype (2n = 48),57 would explain the karyotype differences between turbot and Japanese flounder, as suggested by Robledo et al.9 Despite the general macrosyntenic pattern observed, pairwise alignment of chromosomal sequences indicated that extensive intrachromosomal reorganisations (mainly inversions) would have taken place throughout the evolution of these species (Supplementary Fig. S7A and B). Reorganisations were much more extensive when comparing turbot to half-smooth tongue sole than to Japanese flounder (Fig. 5C and D). The results of the comparison with stickleback are presented in Supplementary Figure S7C. Similar fusion patterns as those identified in the comparison with the other flatfish species are visible, as for example at LG16, that showed macrosyntenic patterns with stickleback’s ChrVII and ChrIV.

DiscussionThe reduced cost of the new genotyping by sequencing (GBS) techniques has facilitated the development of highly dense genetic maps in aquaculture fish species,3,17–19 including turbot.21 Here, we combined for the first time a high number of markers and families for a deep mapping analysis aimed at integrating genetic and physical map resources in turbot to understand its genome organisation and variation, a study not performed to date in fish.23,58 The average number of SNPs in the 31 full-sib families analysed in our work was in the upper range reported in the most recent linkage mapping studies (5–6k SNPs) and ~40 individuals were genotyped at each family. The turbot consensus map (8,532.6 cM) was much longer than any previous linkage map reported for the species (6,647 SNPs, 2,622.1 cM21), but this elongation is the consequence of combining a high number of markers with several mapping families and the MergeMaps software, an artefact highlighted previously by different authors.24,59,–61 A direct consequence of this ‘inflated’ map length is that the average ratio between physical and genetic distance is much lower than usual (0.066 Mb/cM vs ~0.33 Mb/cM in teleost). A way to compensate this bias is to normalise for each LG consensus map coordinates to the average genetic distance obtained from the individual maps used to construct the consensus62 (see Table 1). Accordingly, the average length and average inter-marker distance of the three single family maps used to construct the consensus was 3753.9 and 0.32, respectively, figures much closer to those found by Wang et al.21 using RADseq. Interestingly, the sex-determining region-bearing chromosome (LG0530) showed one of the lowest RF ratio (cM/Mb), which agrees with theoretical expectations on the evolution of the sex-determining chromosome.32The anchorage of the assembled turbot genome to a robust and dense genetic map is essential to transfer marker associations detected by segregation analysis in families to physical positions in the genome for gene mining.63 In our study, ~20% of turbot genome assembly34 was refined, thanks to the mapping information obtained across the 10 most informative families. Furthermore, scaffolds representing 96.5% of turbot genome assembly were anchored to chromosomes, ordered and oriented, and thus, a megascaffold was set up for each LG. This represents a significant improvement from the 80% anchored with the previous medium density turbot map.34 Also, the available cytogenetic information32,40,52 was integrated as much as possible in a common framework with genetic and physical maps, and four marker chromosomes of the turbot karyotype were associated with their respective megascaffolds, and the remaining 18 roughly assigned according to their physical length. Using this information, a new nomenclature is here proposed for the 22 chromosomes/LGs of the species, which will facilitate the integration of the different levels of genome organisation for comparative studies within flatfish and teleosts.9The high correlation observed between genetic and physical maps supports the confidence of marker ordering and physical assembling of turbot genome. However, this general trend was lost at specific chromosome structures such as centromeres and telomeres. Around centromeres extensive dot clouds were visualised, suggestive of poor mapping accuracy very likely related to the decay of RF in the vicinity of heterochromatic blocks.64,65 This was observed not only for pericentromeric heterochromatin but also for interstitial heterochromatic blocks such as the most conspicuous one detected at LG04 (C5). A remarkable RF difference was observed between males and females around heterochromatic structures, especially the centromeres, where females hardly showed RF decay. This fact is the main responsible for the length difference between male and female maps of turbot, as reported previously in other fish species.58,66–68 It is tempting to ascribe the different RF between males and females observed in fish19,66 to different crossing-over patterns around heterochromatic blocks. However, other explanations have been proposed for different species, such as the GC content in Asian sea bass19; stronger selection pressure in male gametes during the haploid life stage in zebrafish66 or in some plants69; and differences in chromatin distribution between sexes as for example in humans 70. More information is needed for a comprehensive explanation to these observations, and indeed, NGS technologies can provide suitable data for this task.The lack of correspondence between physical and genetic maps observed at telomeres in several families and LGs is likely a consequence of a wrong assembly and/or mapping at chromosome ends. These regions were characterised by the presence of a number of short contigs, suggestive of assembling problems likely due to the presence of repetitive DNA. Similarly, when many markers and a comparatively small offspring number per family are handled, mapping programs throw the least confident markers to LG ends, which lead to the loss of collinearity between physical and genetic maps.15 Improving genomic assembly at chromosome ends by using long-read sequencing methods and increasing progeny number per family will be needed to solve this problem.Genetic maps of bony fish reported to date have been based on a few families,19,38,58 and thus, the presence of inter-individual rearrangements affecting marker order has been scarcely addressed. Previous information showed that, despite a general macrosyntenic 1:1 pattern in Acanthopterygii38 and specifically in Pleuronectiformes, a huge intrachromosomal reorganisation (mainly inversions) has taken place along flatfish evolution.9,34 This observation was confirmed in our study, where the genomic comparison between turbot and tongue sole, species pertaining to the distant families Scophthalmidae and Cynoglossidae,71,72 revealed great intrachromosomal reorganisations. Accordingly, polymorphic inversions could occur within flatfish species, and the comparison between individual maps could shed some light on this issue. Using nine families and a much lower amount of markers, Bouza et al.38 suggested a general collinearity among individual maps, and only minor discrepancies were detected at 11 LGs involving markers at short distances (< 3 cM). In our study, two medium-sized chromosome tracts (~7 Mb) at LG06 and LG09 showed features that could be compatible with polymorphic inversions although further work will be necessary to confirm this observation. Combining fluorescence in situ hybridization with BAC probes on these chromosomes or checking linkage between markers within and around the potential inversions with a much higher offspring number could be possible strategies. If confirmed, this information should be considered not only for evolutionary studies but also for marker assisted selection in turbot breeding programs.Flatfish represent one of the most extraordinary examples of anatomical specialisation to a particular lifestyle in vertebrates, and a bitter evolutionary controversy took place in the past about their origin and phylogeny.73,74 The 1:1 macrosyntenic pattern observed between Acanthopterygii38 was confirmed when comparing the available flatfish genomes: turbot, tongue sole and Japanese flounder.9,21,42 The integration of our data with previous information, which includes the recently assembled genome of P. olivaceus,43 enabled us to confirm and refine the suggested chromosome fusions along flatfish evolution.9 Our results highlight that the fusion of ancestral chromosomes in the evolution of turbot genome resulted in the formation of new chromosomes, whose centromeres should correspond to the ancestral centromere of one of the fusing chromosomes, as reported in the origin of human chromosome 2.75 The precise location of centromere-associated markers in the genetic and physical maps strongly supports two main centric fusions in the origin of turbot karyotype (LG02 and LG16) from the ancestral 2n = 48 observed in Japanese flounder.57,76 Flatfish show large variation in chromosome number even across closely related taxa and more than half of flatfish species present a chromosome number lower than the ancestral, suggestive of several fusions, with the minimum diploid number (2n = 26) reported in Citharichthys spilopterus.76 It would be worth investigating in more detail if the high number of chromosome fusions occurring in the families with lower diploid numbers (e.g. Soleidae, Bothidae and Achiridae and some Paralichthydae) show a preferential fusion pattern, similar to what recently found in notothenioids.77 In addition to chromosome fusions, other minor reorganizations between non-orthologous chromosomes of turbot, Japanese flounder and half-smooth tongue sole were identified in our study. These chromosome rearrangements are thought to be important in karyotypic evolution and species differentiation,77–79 and thus, further comparative mapping studies are encouraged to understand the reasons behind these rearrangements in the evolution of flatfish.The turbot HD consensus genetic map here constructed using a set of 18,124 SNPs was a suitable reference to anchor the turbot genome and to integrate all previous genomic information. The comparison of the male and female consensus maps enabled to identify sharp RF differences around centromeres that explained their length differences. The 62 individual genetic maps constructed allowed to detect suggestive polymorphic rearrangements in the species putatively related to coadapted gene blocks. Finally, inter- and intra-chromosomal reorganisations in Pleuronectiformes were identified comparing the chromosome sequences available for three flatfish species taking the turbot map as reference. The consistent HD genetic map reported in turbot represents an invaluable genomic tool for further genome-wide association and evolutionary genomic studies.

IntroductionThe extraordinary increase in genomic data released during the last decade has made possible to begin to unravel the impact of transposable elements (TEs) on a wide range of eukaryotic genomes.1,2 TEs are ‘selfish’ genetic units that can mobilize and increase their copy number in the host genome. TEs can also interrupt genes, produce rearrangements and lead to illegitimate recombination events.3 Most TEs are usually present as defective copies that have accumulated mutations and deletions, which ultimately inactivate their transposition potential. In many organisms, TEs accumulate in centromeric and pericentromeric regions where they play a crucial role in genome plasticity and heterochromatin maintenance.4,5 Nevertheless, active transposons constitute a significant source of mutations that can lead to harmful effects in the host genome.6,7 Thus, most eukaryotes have evolved epigenetic defense mechanisms to limit TE expansion. More specifically, transcriptional and post-transcriptional gene silencing pathways (TGS and PTGS) have been described to limit transposon activity in plants and animals.8,9 TGS operates through DNA methylation, whereas PTGS is mediated by small RNAs and orchestrated by the RNA interference pathway (RNAi). DNA methylation is an epigenetic modification involved in several cellular processes and described in a variety of eukaryotic genomes.10,11 Such modification occurs by the addition of a methyl group to the C-5 position of cytosine in DNA. PTGS mediated by siRNAs (short-interfering RNAs, a class of small RNAs) starts with the production of aberrant double-stranded RNAs (dsRNAs) originated from transposons, viruses, or RNA hairpins, among other sources. The dsRNAs are processed by Dicer RNAse III producing short fragments of 21–25 nucleotides (siRNAs), which are loaded in the RNA-induced silencing complex, guided to complementary mRNA and subsequently degraded by the Argonaute slicer activity.12,13 Also, siRNAs can produce TGS by promoting DNA methylation, as described in plants and fungi.13,14 Recent studies in plants and mammals have described a link between DNA methylation and the RNAi pathways15,16 in transposon silencing, indicating that these mechanisms are functionally related.17 In fungi, epigenetic silencing mechanisms have been extensively explored in the filamentous ascomycete Neurospora crassa and are beginning to be documented in other lineages. This model organism uses TGS and PTGS mechanisms to inactivate TEs at the vegetative and sexual stages. Specifically, a repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) operates during the sexual cycle to transcriptionally silence repetitive sequences through a homology-dependent mechanism. RIP induces C: G to A: T hypermutations in these sequences during the sexual cycle, leading to their degeneration and silencing by DNA methylation.18,19 In ascomycetes, transposons can be inactivated by DNA methylation linked to RIP mutations,20 whereas in basidiomycetes this mechanism has been examined in silico in members of the Pucciniomycotina21 and in the ustilaginomycete Microbotrium violaceum.22 A related mechanism called methylation-induced premeiotically, has been detected in Ascobolus immersus and in the basidiomycete Coprinus cinereus and it displays similar hallmarks with RIP.23,24 Distinct DNA methylation patterns have been observed in some fungal lineages while in others this mechanism seems to be absent.25–27 Recent comprehensive methylome analyses carried out in five fungi belonging to Zygomycota, Ascomycota and Basidiomycota groups reported a marked preference for methylation at CG sites within transposons and other repeated sequences, in contrast to the low methylation levels found in gene-coding regions.26,27 Regarding PTGS and TGS of TEs, three RNAi mechanisms have been described in N. crassa: quelling28 (related to plant co-suppression), MSUD (meiotic silencing by unpaired DNA)29 and DNA methylation associated to disiRNA loci.14 Quelling and MSUD mechanisms are based on the production of small RNAs, and rely on the core components of the RNAi pathway. The former leads to the silencing of repetitive DNA sequences (i.e. transposons or multi-copy genes) in the vegetative phase, and the latter silences unpaired regions between two parental chromosomes during meiosis. Moreover, an RNAi-dependent mechanism has been recently discovered to silence TEs post-transcriptionally during sexual development (SIS, sex-induced silencing) in the basidiomycete Cryptococcus neoformans.30 Although epigenetic mechanisms for TE control have been extensively described in the ascomycete model N. crassa, only a few studies have analysed DNA methylation31,32 and RNAi interference mechanism33 in basidiomycetes. Beyond its biotechnological applications, the lignin-degrader Pleurotus ostreatus has gained relevance in genetic and genomics studies in recent years. Its simple life cycle, the ease of cultivation under laboratory conditions and the availability of an un-gapped telomere-to-telomere genome sequence makes P. ostreatus a good model for basidiomycete studies. Its life cycle alternates between monokaryotic (cells contain only one haploid nucleus) and dikaryotic (cells are dihaploid and contain two haploid nuclei) phases.34 A dikaryotic strain is formed when two compatible monokaryotic strains mate to form a dikaryon where the haploid nuclei remain independent throughout the vegetative growth and fruit-body development. Karyogamy takes place after both haploid nuclei are joined to form a diploid one which undergoes meiosis. Recent comprehensive analyses carried out in our group characterized the landscape of TEs in two compatible monokaryotic strains of P. ostreatus35 (PC9 and PC15). This study uncovered the presence of 80 TE families, which encompass 2.5 and 6.2% of the total genome sizes of PC9 and PC15, respectively. Most TEs were aggregated in 40 non-homologous clusters spread across the 12 chromosomes. Moreover, it was observed that genes having a TE inserted upstream or downstream the gene body have lower transcription levels than average, especially when the genes are enclosed in TE-rich clusters.35 Regarding the potential RNAi activity of P. ostreatus, preliminary data suggests the presence of the RNAi machinery core, which has been detected in silico by screening for Neurospora MSUD and quelling orthologous proteins.36 Using high-throughput sequencing, we describe the genome-wide epigenetic (DNA methylation and small RNAs) and transcriptional (mRNA) profiles of two compatible P. ostreatus monokaryons as well as dikaryons at different stages during fruit body development. Our results support the evidence of strain-specific DNA methylation and small RNA production primarily involved in the repression of transposons activity. Also, we provide evidence that the TE-associated gene silencing effect, previously described by Castanera et al.,35 is correlated to the extension of DNA methylation associated to surrounding transposons. Finally, the comparative analysis of the transcriptomes at different stages of the P. ostreatus life cycle identifies the genes and functions that might be involved in triggering fruit body primordia formation and development.2. Materials and methods2.1 Fungal strains and growth conditionsFour P. ostreatus strains were used: PC9 (Spanish Type Culture Collection accession CECT20312), PC15 (CECT20312), N001 (CECT20600) and N001-HyB. PC9 and PC15 are two compatible monokaryotic protoclones obtained by de-dikaryotization of the N001 commercial strain in 1999. PC15 and PC9 strains have been described previously by our group,37 and display slow- and fast growing phenotypes, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S1). N001-HyB is a dikaryotic strain regenerated ad hoc by mating PC9 and PC15 in 2014,36 which contains the same genetic complement as N001. All strains were cultured in Erlenmeyer flasks containing 200 ml of Malt Extract (ME, 20 g/l) in the dark, at 24°C under orbital shaking (125 rpm). After 6 days, the cultures were homogenized using an Omni mixer and used as inoculum (15 ml) for Submerged Fermentation (SmF) and Solid-state Fermentation (SSF) cultures. SmF was carried out in Erlenmeyer flasks containing 135 ml of liquid ME medium and maintained in the dark for 7 days at 24°C under orbital shaking. SSF was carried out in polycarbonate Magenta boxes containing 15 g of the total dry substrate (v/v) (88% sawdust, 10% millet and 2% CaCO3) and adjusted to an 80% water content. A total of six samples representing the main stages of the P. ostreatus life cycle were obtained for further analysis: (i) vegetative mycelium in SmF (PC9 and PC15); (ii) mycelium under fruiting induction in SSF (M_N001 and N001-HyB); (iii) primordia (P_N001); and (iv) mature fruitbodies (F_N001) (Fig. 1) in SSF. To induce fruiting conditions, completely colonized SSF cultures were maintained at 18°C under a light/dark photoperiod of 12 h until fruit-body formation (~15 days). Three biological replicates per condition were separately sampled, ground in a sterile mortar in the presence of liquid nitrogen and stored before nucleic acids extraction. Summary of P. ostreatus samples used in this study. PC15 and PC9 represent two monokaryotic strains that fuse to generate ad hoc the dikaryon N001-HyB. Given its inability to fructify, N001-HyB is examined exclusively at the mycelium stage. The N001 dikaryotic strain, bearing both PC15 and PC9 haploid nuclei and maintained under continuing subculturing during several years, is analyzed under different developmental stages (mycelium M_N001, primordium P_N001, and fruitbodies F_N001). N001-HyB and N001 harbor the same genetic complement although they show different fruiting ability.Summary of P. ostreatus samples used in this study.

Whole genome bisulphite (WGBS) libraries were prepared as described in Morselli et al.39 Briefly, genomic DNA (gDNA) from the fungal samples was extracted using an E.Z.N.A Fungal DNA Mini Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA). After additional RNase A treatment (10 mg/ml for 60 min at 37°C), gDNA was purified using phenol: chloroform solution (3:1), precipitated overnight with ethanol (2:1) and the pellet resuspended in nuclease-free water. For additional purification after extraction, gDNA was treated with the Genomic DNA Clean & Concentrator Kit (Zymo Research, Irvine, CA). The concentrations were quantified using a Qubit 2.0 fluorometer (Life Technology, Carlsbad, CA) and total gDNA was fragmented with a Covaris S-2 ultrasonicator to obtain fragments spanning from 150 to 300 bp size range. Library preparation was performed using the Illumina TruSeq DNA Sample Prep40 according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Bisulphite conversion was carried out with the EpiTect Kit (QIAGEN), performing two consecutive rounds of conversion for a total of 10 h of incubation. Converted DNA was amplified according to the following PCR programme: denaturation at 98°C for 2 min, 12 cycles of 98°C for 15 s, 60°C for 30 s, 72°C for 30 s and final extension at 72°C for 5 min. All libraries obtained after bisulphite treatment were sequenced by an Illumina HiSeq2000 system (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using 100 bp single-end reads. Quantitative DNA methylation assays were also performed in a selected set of genes by bisulphite-free real-time PCR following the MSRE-qPCR approach (detailed protocol shown described in Supplementary Material S1).2.3 Preparation of mRNA and small RNAs-sequencing librariesTotal RNA isolation for mRNA (mRNA-seq) and small RNA (sRNA-seq) sequencing was performed using a Fungal RNA E.Z.N.A Kit (Omega Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s guidelines. The integrity and quantity of RNA were validated by Bioanalyzer (version 2100) and Qubit 2.0 fluorometer. mRNA-seq libraries were prepared using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) following the manufacturer’s instruction. Total RNA was used for isolation of poly(A)-carrying mRNA molecules and synthesis of double-stranded cDNA before adapters ligations. For sRNA libraries, small RNAs molecules were resolved by electrophoresis on a 6% (w/v) polyacrylamide gel and the fraction corresponding to < 200 nt in length was eluted from the gel. Adapter-ligated molecules were reverse transcribed and enriched by PCR. The final libraries were quantified by real-time PCR in LightCycler 480 (Roche) and sequenced with an Illumina HiSeq 2000 system using 75 and 100 bp paired-end reads.2.4 Analysis of sequencing dataReads from all libraries were mapped to the P. ostreatus reference genomes (PC15 v2.0, www.genome.jgi.doe.gov/PleosPC15_2/PleosPC15_2.home.html and PC9 v1.0 https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/PleosPC9_1/PleosPC9_1.info.html). The PC15 v2.0 reference genome is completely assembled in twelve scaffolds (34.3 Mb genome size).37 In total, 12,330 genes have been annotated in this genome.41 A detailed description of the data analysis workflows used in this study is shown in Supplementary Material S1. BS-seq, sRNA-seq and mRNA-seq data-sets were obtained in triplicate, except for Primordia, where n = 2 in BS-seq analysis.3. Results3.1 DNA methylation and sRNA profiles during P. ostreatus’ life cycleWhole-genome bisulphite sequencing (BS-seq) was carried out in six representative samples of the P. ostreatus life cycle (Fig. 1) to investigate the profile of 5-cytosine DNA methylation. Sequencing of BS-seq libraries yielded an average of 40 ± 6 million total reads per sample. Reads were aligned to the PC15 v2.0 reference genome, obtaining coverages ranging from 66 to 97× (Supplementary Table S2A). The global methylation levels ranged from 2.8 to 6.7% of the total cytosines, and the bisulphate non-conversion rate was 0.27%. P. ostreatus has the lowest methylation levels in the monokaryotic stage, although the two strains tested showed differences between them (2.8% in PC15 vs. 4.4% in PC9, respectively) (Supplementary Table S2B). Interestingly, we found that the reconstructed N001-HyB dikaryotic strain (obtained by mating PC15 and PC9 monokaryons, see Section 2) exhibited methylation levels substantially lower than the ‘natural’ N001 dikaryotic strain (3.96 vs. 6.48%), which displayed nearly identical levels in the three developmental stages (Fig. 2A). Cytosine methylation was clearly predominant in the CpG context in all samples (4.0 ± 2% in CpG vs. 0.5 ± 0.1% in CHG and 0.6 ± 0.2% in CHH (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S2B) and hereafter we focus only on this context. Reads were also aligned to the P. ostreatus PC9 reference genome, and results yielded similar methylation levels compared with the PC15 reference genome in all among samples (Supplementary Table S2C and D). Due to lower assembling quality of PC9 reference genome (572 scaffolds and a total of 476 gaps covering 9.72% of the whole assembly), the subsequent analyses were performed on the fully assembled PC15 reference genome. To validate the findings obtained by BS-seq analysis, methylation levels were also estimated by performing bisulphite-free real-time PCR method. The results of the MSRE-qPCR (methylation sensitive restriction enzyme qPCR) profiles of five genes in PC9 and PC15 monokaryotic samples confirmed the trend previously outlined by bisulphite treatment followed by NGS sequencing (Supplementary Fig. S2). The distribution of 5-methylcytosines (5mC) was analysed in two different genomic contexts: genes and TEs. The results uncovered significant differences between these two features. Genes showed patterns of hypomethylation, with average methylation levels ranging from 1.5 to 4%. In contrast, TEs were heavily methylated, with levels ranging from 20 to 60% (Fig. 2B). We also observed sharp 5mC increments in the adjacent regions of both initial and terminal TE insertion sites, reaching the maximum methylation levels along the whole transposon body. In contrast, this trend was absent in protein-coding genes. Regarding the difference between samples, the methylation levels of N001 were the highest and showed no variation during fruitbody development, neither within genes nor in TEs. The genome-wide production of small RNAs was investigated in the same six samples by sRNA sequencing (mapping statistics using PC15 and PC9 as reference genomes are shown in Supplementary Table S3A and B). Most of the small RNAs originated from non-annotated genomic features, which could match with heterochromatin regions spread in the genome of P. ostreatus (Fig. 2C). The amount of repeat-associated small interfering RNA (rasiRNA) varied between the six samples, ranging from 14% to 37% of the total mapped reads, whereas the percentage of sRNAs mapping to genes ranged from 16 to 44%. The population of small RNAs was further characterized by analysing the length distribution. A maximum peak was found at 21 nt in all strains and samples (Fig. 2D and Supplementary Fig. S3).

An average of 24.16 ± 2.6 millions of uniquely aligned reads per sample (Supplementary Table S4) were used to calculate the transcriptional levels of all non-TE genes (genes overlapping with TEs were excluded) and perform differential expression analyses. We performed all-by-all sample comparisons and found that 3,531 out of the 11,828 genes were differentially expressed in the samples analysed (3-fold Log2 cutoff, FDR-corrected P-value < 0.05). The biggest differences were found between PC15 and M_N001 (1,528 DEGs, Table 1), and the smallest between primordia (P_N001) and fruitbody (F_N001) samples of N001 (6 DEGs). To analyse the expression trends of DEGs under the six samples, we performed a hierarchical clustering of the 3,531 genes. We identified a total of nine clusters of co-expression, consisting of variable numbers of genes (heatmap vertical axis, Fig. 3). Three of the nine clusters were further analysed due to their relevance for the study of fruitbody triggering and development (Clusters B, C and D) and one for the role of dominance in the expression profiles of the dikaryotic stage (Cluster A). Specifically, the expression of genes belonging to Cluster A (906 genes) was high in PC15 and low in PC9, and the dikaryons showed either intermediate profile (N001-HyB) or PC9-like profile (M_N001, P_N001 and F_N001). Cluster C (142 genes) showed an increased transcription during fruitbody triggering and higher expression than monokaryons in primordia and fruitbodies. Finally, Clusters B and D (614 and 36 genes, respectively) were upregulated during fruitbody development. To better understand the link between transcription and DNA methylation in the different stages of P. ostreatus development, we represented the average value of these two marks in genes belonging to the selected clusters (Fig. 3). Genes belonging to Clusters B, C and D showed a nearly complete lack of methylation. Notably, genes included in Cluster A showed higher methylation levels in PC9 and N001 (about 35% average methylation level for N001 samples). Moreover, this hypermethylation pattern coincided with a low expression in the two strains. Further analysis showed that 29% of the genes belonging to Cluster A were present inside the TE-rich regions defined by Castanera et al.35 In contrast, this percentage decreased to 13% in Cluster B, 20% in Cluster C and 8% in Cluster D. (Supplementary Fig. S4). Next, we retrieved the functional annotation of all genes and performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment focussing on the selected Clusters. This approach revealed over-represented molecular functions (MFs), biological processes (BPs) and cellular components. Specifically, the most enriched ontology of cluster A was 3’-5’ exonuclease activity (MF), in Cluster B was monooxygenase activity (MF), in cluster C was structural constituent of cell wall (MF), and in Cluster D was fruiting body development (Supplementary Table S5). Interestingly, other significantly enriched BP enriched during fruiting induction was multicellular organism development (Table 2, Cluster C). These data also provided evidence of the different transcriptional profiles between the natural N001 (M_N001) and the regenerated N001-HyB. We found that a total of 395 genes were differentially transcribed between these two strains. The comparison displayed that 349 genes were upregulated in the N001-HyB and 46 in M_N001 strain (Supplementary Fig. S5). Not surprisingly, when we performed GO enrichment analysis between these two dikaryotic strains, the subset of enriched functions revealed that BP involved in fruitbody development was exclusively represented in the genes upregulated in M_N001 strain (Supplementary Table S6).

Thus, we considered the possibility of an unequal contribution of each monokaryotic nucleus to the dikaryons. To test this hypothesis, we mapped BS-seq data to a new set of pseudo-genomes consisting of the nucleus-specific regions concatenated with the common regions sharing a similarity < 90% (one unique pseudo-genome for PC15 and another for PC9). To build this reference sequences sets, we performed a whole genome alignment between PC15 and PC9 using the NUCmer software.42 The direct pairwise comparison revealed an average of 97.2% similarity in the aligned regions, which spanned 87.3% of PC15 assembly and 83.2% of PC9. Afterward, we determined the nucleus-specific methylation levels in M_N001 and N001-HyB by performing BS-Seeker2 analyses43 on the unique regions (pseudo-genomes of PC9 and PC15 used as references). We observed similar low mappability rates between the M_N001 and N001-HyB strains when aligned to each reference genome, which could reflect the presence of repetitive sequences along both pseudo-genomes. Interestingly, when we looked at the global DNA methylation values, we found that each nucleus contributed differentially in the two dikaryotic strains (Table 3). In fact, while genomic regions deriving from the PC9 nucleus exhibited comparable methylation levels in both the natural and ad hoc dikaryons (coefficient of variation of 13.4%), differences in regions associated with the PC15 nucleus were higher (coefficient of variation of 37.9%). Specifically, methylation of the PC15 nucleus in N001-HyB was considerably lower than in M_N001 (18.11 vs. 34.45%), where the methylation levels of both PC9 nuclei were similar (32.23 vs. 39.62). Next, we sought to identify genomic regions showing significant differential methylation between these two strains. Using the SMART2 software, we detected a total of 2, 199 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of 200–5,714 bp in length (Supplementary Fig. S6A). Among the resulting DMR, 98% were significantly hypermethylated in M_N001 vs. N001-HyB (Supplementary Fig. S6 B). Summary of BS-seq mapping to PC15 and PC9 unique pseudo-genomesSummary of BS-seq mapping to PC15 and PC9 unique pseudo-genomes3.4 DNA methylation, small RNA production and transcriptome landscape in P. ostreatusThe overall distribution and levels of DNA methylation, mRNA and sRNAs production were analysed along the twelve P. ostreatus chromosomes using the dikaryotic N001 strain (sample M_N001) as reference. We noticed that DNA methylation and sRNAs production were tightly associated with TE-rich clusters spread along the genome, where the transcriptional activity had dramatic depletion (Figs 4A and B). Moreover, we found that the levels of methylation and sRNA production varied regionally and between chromosomes. Considering these data, we sought to analyse the correlation of methylation levels with mRNA and sRNA expression across the entire genome. For this purpose, the genome was divided into 200 bp windows. Windows were split into three groups according to their methylation levels (Group I: 0–20%, Group II: 20–60% and Group III: > 60%), and plotted with their corresponding sRNA and mRNA expression. In addition, we analysed the correlation across genes and promoter regions according to the same methylation ranges previously mentioned. As shown in Figure 4C, DNA methylation exhibited a negative correlation with mRNA transcription. Although the strongest repression was found in windows with >60% average methylation, the sharpest decrease in expression was found to occur when methylation exceeded 20%. Regarding DNA methylation and sRNAs expression, the two marks were positively correlated (Fig. 4D). Notably, we noticed that the majority of the sRNA production (approximately 95%) derived exclusively from a very small portion of the whole genome (3.3% of entire genome). When we analysed both mRNA and sRNA abundances at genes and promoter regions, a similar negative correlation between methylation and mRNA expression was uncovered among the three methylation ranges. In particular, promoter regions displayed lower mRNA transcriptional levels when compared with genes. On the contrary, a positive correlation was detected between sRNA and methylation in both genes and promoter regions, with slightly higher sRNA expression levels in correspondence to promoter regions.

Within the different TE orders, terminal inverted repeats (TIR), long terminal repeats (LTR) and Dictyostelium Intermediate Repeat Sequences (DIRS) were the most heavily methylated and showed the lowest expression. Helitron and long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE) elements had slightly lower methylation and higher expression values. This general trend was maintained in all samples and strains, although, PC15 had the lowest 5mC rate in all TE orders, which corresponded to the highest expression ratios. We performed a deeper analysis accounting for the 80 TE families present in P. ostreatus and found that PC15 TE families were consistently hypomethylated compared with the other strains (Fig. 5D). Hierarchical clustering of TE methylation and expression displayed that the most invasive TE families (LTR/Gypsy) were strongly methylated (26–59% on average) and transcriptionally repressed (Fig. 5D, Supplementary Fig. S7A). Nevertheless, other less abundant families, such as TIR_1, displayed higher methylation levels (35–67%) and complete transcriptional repression. Next, we analysed the production of sRNAs by genes, TE orders and families in the context previously described. The amount of sRNAs per element (i.e. gene or TE) was higher in TEs than in genes (Fig. 5C), although it varied greatly depending on the strain and TE order. sRNAs were abundantly produced by TIR transposons in all samples (reaching average levels up to ~7,000 RPM/copy in the PC9 strain), with the only exception of PC15 which displayed much lower production of sRNA associated to TIR elements. The LTRs in the Gypsy superfamily and Helitrons also showed high sRNAs production, especially in PC15 and N001-HyB strains, and the remaining orders had low amounts of mapped sRNAs. Considering the percentage of sRNAs mapped to TEs (rasiRNAs), Gypsy, Copia retroelements and TIRs were the main sources, with great differences between families (Supplementary Fig. S7B). Next, we tested whether the production of rasiRNAs by TE families was related to (i) size (family copy number) or (ii) age (divergence between TE copies and family consensus). Despite detecting differences between strains, we found that the TE families containing more than 10 copies tend to have the highest rasiRNAs expression (Supplementary Fig. S8A). This effect was especially relevant in abundant sRNAs-producing samples, such as PC9, where rasiRNA abundance (RPM/copy) was positively correlated with family copy number (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.42, P-value = 1.542-5) (Fig. 6A). To explore the relationship between rasiRNAs production and family age, we correlated rasiRNAs data to the average divergence rate, which increases linearly with family age (Supplementary Fig. S8B). Using PC9 as a reference, we found that the average family divergence and rasiRNAs expression were negatively correlated (Pearson correlation coefficient = -0.25, P-value = 0.01617) (Fig. 6B).

Our previous investigations found that TE insertions lead to a significant reduction of the expression levels of surrounding genes within 1 kb.35 Also, we found that this TE-mediated gene silencing effect was stronger when genes were located inside any of the 40 TE clusters described in P. ostreatus. We explored the possibility that this phenomenon had an epigenetic explanation. We tested the hypothesis that methylation could spread outside TE boundaries reaching the surrounding genes and blocking their transcription. Therefore, we compared the methylation and expression levels of genes surrounded by transposons (Fig. 7) (within a window of 1 kb, either upstream or downstream the gene body, Group I, labelled as +TE) and genes not surrounded by TEs (Group II, labelled as Ctl). Additionally, to uncover the impact of TE clusters on this phenomenon, we split the first group of genes in two contexts: (i) genes located inside a TE cluster (cluster) and (ii) genes located outside TE clusters (isolated). As shown in Figure 7A and B using N001_HyB and M_N001 strains as a model, genes carrying a TE insertion displayed higher methylation levels than the control groups (P < 0.05). In the case of genes in TE cluster (Fig. 7B), we found a bimodal distribution of methylation, with approximately half of the genes having high 5mC levels (up to 40% in N001-HyB and 70% in M_N001). Regarding transcriptional profiles (Fig. 7C and D), genes surrounded by TEs had lower expression than controls (P < 0.05), especially genes present inside a TE cluster (Fig. 7D). This phenomenon was present in the six strains, although with different intensities (Supplementary Fig. S9A–D and Table S7). Furthermore, we analysed the distribution of sRNA in genes grouped into the contexts described earlier. Notably, no significant differences in sRNAs production were found among genes surrounded by a TE and the group control (Supplementary Fig. S9E and F). Next, we studied the distribution of methylation across the gene body and regions adjacent to the TSS and TTS. The aim was to understand if the methylation extension was spreading from the TE to the whole gene body or only to the promoter sequence in both contexts (TE cluster or isolated TE). We found that the methylation levels mildly decreased from the adjacent regions to the gene body. Nevertheless, gene body methylation of genes in both contexts was much higher than the control, reaching average values around 13% for genes isolated and with TE insertions and up to 25% for genes with TE insertions present in a TE cluster (Fig. 8A). Further analyses on the relationship between transcription and gene body methylation found that genes carrying TE insertions (at 1 kb upstream or downstream) had only two activity state. As represented in Figure 8B and C, the clear majority of genes surrounded by a TE held methylated and silenced activity state, whereas only a few copies displayed unmethylated and transcriptionally active state, similarly to almost all genes included in the control group not enclosed by TE insertions (Fig. 8D).

Discussion4.1 Epigenetic factors contribute to P. ostreatus genome regulationPrevious findings have illustrated the presence and importance of epigenetic modifications in fungi (for review, see44). Most of the data on fungal epigenetics comes from DNA methylation and RNAi studies performed in ascomycete fungi. However, few studies have reported evidence of the presence of such mechanisms in basidiomycetes.26,32 In N. crassa, it was observed that Dim-2 DMTase is responsible for methylation at both symmetrical and asymmetrical sites and is required for de novo and maintenance of DNA methylation.45,46 In plants, asymmetric methylation is maintained by the activity of de novo methyltransferases drm1, drm2 and chromomethylase 3 (cmt3). In fact, Cao et al.47 reported the absence of asymmetric methylation only in drm1 drm2 and cmt3 triple mutant plants, suggesting that the regulation of non-CG methylation is complex. Castanera et al.35 reported that Dim-2 DMTase was transcriptionally active in the genome of P. ostreatus, and it also carries a transcriptionally active cmt3. Nevertheless, it lacks dmr1 and dmr2 homologs, as it happens in N. crassa. According to these results, we hypothesize that the differences in the non-CG methylation levels between basidiomycetes and ascomycetes might be associated with the different evolutionary trajectories of their respective Dim-2 DMTases. Our results confirm the presence of 5-cytosine methylation in this basidiomycete, predominantly localized within repetitive regions, in the symmetric CpG context. This predominance has also been detected by methylome analyses of five species belonging to the three major fungal groups (ascomycetes, basidiomycetes and zygomycetes).26 Despite an estimated divergence time of >1 billion years, similar methylation patterns were found between basidiomycetes and zygomycetes, displaying a marked trend toward CpG methylation of regions located within TEs or other repetitive loci, and global weak methylation associated to genes. The methylation pattern of P. osteratus was similar to what has been described for other basidiomycete species, showing substantial amount of CG methylation and a small amount of non-CG methylation both concentrated in repetitive regions. These divergent patterns might underline evolutionary differences in mechanisms related to DNA methylation within fungal species characterized by different genome structure and lifestyle. Selker et al48, stated that in N. crassa, asymmetric methylation might be associated to methylation events occurring during premeiosis in the parental nuclei. This condition is maintained during the vegetative state in those genomic regions exhibiting RIP mutations and where the methylation is present. Based on these observations, the low asymmetric methylation levels found in P. ostreatus could be due to its negligible RIP levels (data not shown), which could make up a strategy to avoid silencing of genes involved in growth and development processes in monokaryon as well as dikaryons mycelia, the most common developmental stage in nature. In this regard, Chan et al.49 suggested that non-CG DNA methylation can be inherited via a network of different and persistent signals that have been co-opted to regulate developmentally important genes, though we have not carried out in Pleurotus experiments to test such hypothesis. Thus, this statement is only a speculation. Our findings showed that cytosine methylation ranged from 2 to 6% in the six samples analysed at different growing stages. These methylation levels are comparable to those described for other fungi so far,26,27,50 except the highly methylated genome of Tuber melanosporum, displaying up to 44% cytosine methylation.51 Previous studies in plants52 and fungi27 have demonstrated that the activity of transposons can be efficiently shut down by chromatin modifications linked to 5mC, as a defense mechanism aimed at controlling their expansion. In higher fungi, this trend has been reported in T. melanosporum, suggesting that methylation principally targets TEs.51 Consistent with this observation, we found that P. ostreatus transposons are highly methylated whereas gene-coding regions are hypomethylated, independently of the strain and developmental stage (Fig. 2B). It is worth noting that the highest methylation levels are maintained across the whole transposon body, while they sharply decrease beyond the transposon borders. A plausible explanation for this locally-restricted methylation might be the ‘mosaic methylation’ described in invertebrates and plants. As reviewed by Suzuki et al.,10 this strategy attempts to delimit potential detrimental changes induced by methylation and prevent spurious transcriptional silencing across the genome. In addition to 5-cytosine methylation, we describe the genomic hallmark associated with the production of small RNAs. We show that endogenous sRNAs produced by P. ostreatus are enriched in the 21 nt fraction (Fig. 2D) which could reflect the presence of RNAi-like silencing mechanisms such as those described in other eukaryotes.5,53 In the basidiomycete C. neoformans, experimental analyses showed the presence of 21–23 nt endogenous sRNAs involved in the control of mobile elements.30 Also, the plant-pathogen Puccinia striiformis produces 20–22 nt sRNA likely involved in PTGS.33 In this sense, P. ostreatus contains a highly conserved, transcriptionally active RNAi machinery composed of Argonaute, Dicer and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase proteins36 (18 proteins sharing 93–100% similarity between PC9 and PC15 strains).4.2 TEs are targeted by DNA methylation and RNAi machineryTEs play a major role in genome stability and evolution54 but are also a source of mutation that can result in deleterious or lethal effects to the host. Thus, epigenetic mechanism encoded by the host genome has been developed to silence their expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.5 Here, we found that DNA methylation and sRNA production were correlated with the presence of silent TEs, suggesting a role in their activity leading to transcriptional suppression. This association was even more striking in TE-rich regions. Specifically, TE clusters were shown to be transcriptionally silenced and highly methylated, similarly to that described in the basidiomycete Laccaria bicolor.26 In this sense, the accumulation of silent transposon knobs could correspond to heterochromatic regions matching to centromeric and pericentromeric zones, as described in plants.55 Regarding DNA methylation, both Classes I and II transposons had higher methylation compared with genes. This observation supports the hypothesis that transcriptional silencing mediated by DNA methylation could be primarily responsible for TE inactivation in P. ostreatus. Similarly to the ascomycete T. melanosporum,51 we found that both LTR-retrotransposons and Class II transposons were abundantly methylated. It is interesting to note that the most methylated orders, TIR and LTR/Gyspy, also accounted for the larger portion of 21 nt rasiRNAs (Fig. 5C), especially TIR transposons belonging to the Mariner superfamily, the only cut-and-paste elements described in P. ostreatus. An example of this association has been reported in wheat, where most of the 21–22 nt sRNAs perfectly targeted within TIR regions of MITE elements, indicating that they are subjected to post-transcriptional control.56 An explanation for such an impressive amount of rasiRNA might reside in the hairpin RNA structure that elements from the TIR1 family can adopt due to the presence of Terminal Inverted Repeats (Supplementary Fig. S10), a conformation that promotes the presence of dsRNA and triggers RNAi machinery. In Caenorhabditis elegans, it has been proposed that such conformations lead to rasiRNA production from Mariner elements.5 Previous studies have described that Class I transposons predominate in basidiomycetes genomes whereas Class II transposons show limited expansion. This is especially relevant in the agaricomycotina subphylum,57 to which P. ostreatus belongs, and might be a consequence of the efficient replicative mechanism of Class I elements. According to our results, the under-representation of Class II transposons in the P. ostreatus genome might also be related to a stronger post-transcriptional inactivation in comparison to Class I elements. Based on our results, the production of rasiRNAs positively correlates with family size and negatively correlates with mean family divergence (Fig. 6A). Thus, the production of sRNA molecules might reflect an attempt to limit the expansion of the youngest, most invasive TE families of the genome. This observation is reminiscent of co-suppression studies carried out in the basidiomycete C. neoformans. In this species, mitotic-induced silencing pathway, a quelling-like asexual mechanism operating in trans, lead to RNAi-mediated silencing of homologous sequences and repeated elements during vegetative growth.58 Also, a similar mechanism was shown to induce post-transcriptional inactivation of repetitive transgenes and transposons mediated by 21–23-nt sRNAs during the sexual reproduction (SIS).30 Interestingly, the production of sRNAs in this fungal model increased according to the transgenes copy number with both mechanisms. Our finding suggests that P. ostreatus can inactivate transposons at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional level, by epigenetic modifications associated with DNA methylation and 21 nt sRNAs production. In this scenario, we speculate that sRNAs might be involved in the methylation of repetitive regions spread in the genome, guiding their silencing at the transcriptional level similarly to what has been reported in plants,59 where non-canonical RdDM has been described to be mediated by 21–22 nt long sRNAs.164.3 Methylated-TEs induce transcriptional silencing of nearby genesAccording to our results, we propose that TE-associated transcriptional silencing of nearby genes occurs due to the extension of DNA methylation from TEs to the surrounding genes, which contain significantly higher methylation levels compared with controls. This is consistent with the results described in Magnaporthe oryzae, where genes with upstream, downstream or gene body methylation show lower expression than controls.50 Similarly, in T. melanosporum TEs close to highly expressed genes (1 kb upstream/downstream the TSS or TTS) tend to be less methylated than transposons located in the proximity of lowly expressed genes.51 In our model, methylation of genes surrounded by TE insertions decreases from regions adjacent to the TSS and TTS, reaching the lowest levels in the gene body. This observation fits with the hypothesis of methylation being extended from the closest TE, repressing the transcriptional activity of neighbour genes as documented in plants60 and animals.61 Another intriguing point is to understand how much methylation is needed to impact the transcriptional activity. In light of our findings, we propose that low to intermediate methylation levels (<20%) can prompt transcriptional silencing, although the strongest repression is found when methylation exceeds 60% (Figs 4C and 8B). Another striking observation is that genes displaying TEs insertion upstream or downstream of gene bodies have equal or even lower sRNA levels than control genes (Supplementary Fig. S9E and F). This suggests that TE insertions are presumably not involved in post-transcriptional silencing of nearby genes, and indicates that TE-mediated gene silencing is promoted by DNA methylation. Nevertheless, other mechanisms associated to silent heterochromatin structures such as methylation of histone H3 at Lys9 (H3K9me3)62 should be further investigated to understand their putative role in this phenomenon.4.4 P. ostreatus fruiting stage is associated with methylation-independent transcriptional reprogrammingThe exploratory analyses carried out during P. ostreatus development yielded some insights into the transcriptional changes underlying fruitbody induction and development. The transition from vegetative mycelium to primordium stage is a complex process that requires the aggregation of cells into compact hyphal knots which later experience tissue differentiation. In P. ostreatus, fruiting is triggered (among other environmental conditions) by lowering temperature and introducing light-dark cycles.63 In our study, these conditions lead to fruiting induction in N001, accompanied by the activation of a set of genes (especially Cluster D) expressed at low levels in monokaryons and also in N001-HyB (a strain unable to fruit), suggesting their putative role in the fruiting process. According to the number of DEGs between M_N001 and N001-HyB, at most 3% of the P. ostreatus genes are necessary for the early induction, while very few genes are presumably involved in changes from primordial to mature fruit bodies, similarly to what has been found in the basidiomycete Coprinopsis cinerea.64 Within this relatively small gene pool, the impressive overexpression of the pleurotolysin B (GO: 0030582, > 15-fold increase in M_N001, P_N001 and F_N001 vs. any of the monokaryotic stages and N001_Hyb), suggests its important role in the fruiting process. In this sense, previous experimental work has shown that the expression of these hemolytic proteins is activated during the formation of primordia and young fruit bodies in P. ostreatus and Agrocybe aegerita.65 Within the clusters of genes expressed during fruiting induction, we also found enriched functions related to multicellular development (Cluster C), although the most enriched biological function was related to transport, similarly to what was reported for C. cinerea, were such activity is upregulated prior to enlargement of fruiting bodies.64 The analysis of MFs activated during fruitbody triggering and development in P. ostreatus suggest that oxidorreductase and binding activities are the most enriched. Glycoside hydrolases were also found to be enriched in Cluster B, along with other proteins such as oxidative enzymes, hydrophobins involved in the aggregation of aerial hyphae and lectins, previously described to be involved in this process in basidiomycetes.64,66 This indicates that the core genes involved in the fruiting process are conserved across the Basidiomycota phylum. Interestingly, despite the differences in transcription of fruiting-associated genes, methylation levels were invariably low along the six samples. These results suggest that fruiting body formation in P. ostreatus is not triggered by epigenetic modifications linked to DNA methylation.4.5 Nucleus-specific methylation is compensated in the long-term dikaryotic stageThe sample-specific profiles presented in this study can provide a framework for understanding the epigenetic and transcriptomic differentiation observed during the P. ostreatus life cycle (Fig. 1). Also, our experimental design allowed us to compare the epigenetic profiles of short-term (N001-HyB) vs. long-term (N001) cultured dikaryons. In fact, striking differences were found between these two strains, which share the same genetic complement but have clearly different methylation profiles. In particular, N001 has heterotic TE methylation levels higher than the parental strains PC15 and PC9, whereas N001-HyB shows mid-parent level values (Fig. 5A). Our results suggest that this difference can be explained by the different contribution of each nucleus to the overall methylation levels in the dikaryon, as in N001-HyB the PC9 nucleus is more methylated than PC15, whereas in N001 both nuclei show similar levels (Table 3). The N001 strain has been sub-cultured for >20 years as a dikaryon, whereas N001-HyB is the result of a very recent mating (< 10 sub-cultures) between the compatible protoclones of PC15 and PC9, which were stored as isolated strains in a Culture Collection longer than 15 years. In fungi, the dikaryotic stage is accomplished through the migration of nuclei from one cell to another cell. Thus, the impaired contribution in the dikaryotic formation, could suggest that the dikaryotization was not completely established in the N001-HyB mycelium, besides the presence of clamp connections in the culture. The two nuclei present in dikaryons experience co-evolution in the long-term.67 In this context, the dikaryotic stage is thought to be favored over the monokaryotic, as deleterious mutations in one nucleus can be compensated with the healthy allele of the other, or even reverted by compensatory mutations such as described for Schizophyllum commune.68 Our results suggest that in addition to permanent modifications (such as mutations), epigenetic profiles are also compensated in long-lasting dikaryons. This compensation led to higher methylation in the N001 strain, which can account for their better defense against TEs than their single monokaryotic counterparts. A similar phenomenon was observed in Arabidopsis, where the distribution of epialleles inherited from the parental lines may reflect the selection against demethylated traits possibly influencing plant fitness.69 Nevertheless, this phenomenon is not observed in recently formed dikaryons such as N001-HyB, where methylation profiles of independent nuclei resemble those of their original monokaryotic parentals. To our knowledge, no similar study has reported this event in fungi. Nevertheless, in plant hybrids, an siRNA-mediated mechanism called trans-chromosomal methylation is responsible for equilibrating the methylation levels of alleles, leading to an increase of methylation in the ‘low parent allele’ and resulting in overall higher methylation levels in the F1 hybrids.70 The N001 profile mimics this phenomenon, where the increase in methylation of PC15 alleles would lead to the balanced nucleus-specific methylation that we have described. The intermediate values found in N001-HyB suggest that this phenomenon could be the result of a slow process requiring progressive co-adaptation of the two nuclei in an unique cytoplasm, something that seems reasonable as nuclei in dikaryons remain un-fused during most of their lives. The case of Cluster A (Fig. 3) is an interesting example of how long-term compensation can impact the methylation levels of many genes. This group of genes is present in TE-rich clusters showing opposite methylation profiles in PC15 and PC9, which leads to the presence of epialleles in the early formed dikaryon N001-HyB. In this case, the hypomethylated profile of PC15 is dominant in many Cluster A genes of the latter strain but shifts to a hypermethylated and transcriptionally silent PC9-like profile in the long-term dikaryon N001. This observation suggests that the two nuclei that coexist in the recently formed dikaryon retain some degree of independence prior to establishing crosstalk interactions. Based on our findings, we propose that the TE dynamics could rewire the epigenetic landscape of the fungal genome, promoting gene silencing at their surroundings and generating epialleles in the dikaryotic stage. The methylation profile of these epialleles is subjected to compensation after long-term culture, leading to balanced methylation levels in each nucleus.FundingThis work was supported by Spanish National Research Plan (Project AGL2014-55971 R) and FEDER funds; Public University of Navarre.

IntroductionFruits are unique plant developmental systems representing an important constituent of human and animal diets due to their high mineral, vitamin and sugar contents.1 In addition, fruits are rich sources of anti-oxidant compounds, such as carotenoids, anthocyanins and flavonoids, and can therefore be used as dietary nutraceutics for human health.2,3 The textures, flavours and nutritional qualities of fruits are determined at the ripening stage.4 In fruit trees and crops, various genes and regulators have been identified as encoding or regulating enzymes in the biosynthetic pathways of fruit components during ripening.5 For example, in tomato, MADS-box genes, ripening inhibitor (RIN) and agamous-like 1 (TAGL1) dramatically affect fruit ripening.6,7 However, fruit ripening is a developmental process characterized by a series of transitions that are coordinated by a network of interacting genes and signalling pathways,8 and thus, the genetic and molecular factors that regulate ripening must be deciphered to improve fruit quality at the genome-wide level.With the rapid development of transcriptome sequencing, a large proportion of non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been found in the genome.9 Regulatory ncRNAs, including small ncRNAs and long ncRNAs (lncRNAs), play vital roles in plant growth and development.10 In the past decade, the functions of small ncRNAs including microRNAs and small interfering RNAs in plant development have been intensively studied.11 For example, in transcript regulation, sly-miR1534 plays a major role in the synthesis of plant hormones in tomato.12 Although many studies on fruit ripening have been performed,13–15 only a few studies have reported on the role of lncRNAs in fruit qualities and fruit pigmentation. Generally, lncRNAs are >200 nucleotides in length and mainly transcribed by RNA polymerase II, and they are involved in the regulation of various biological processes, including plant growth and development and the response to stress.16–18 According to their positions with respect to protein-coding genes, lncRNAs can be classified into intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs), anti-sense lncRNAs (lncNATs) and intronic lncRNAs.19 Currently, lncRNAs are regarded as star RNAs in many respects, including the regulation of gene expression, protein binding and the maintenance of chromosome stability.20 LncRNAs also function as precursors and endogenous target mimics (eTMs) for certain miRNAs, providing a new mechanism for the regulation of miRNA activity.21 With the development of next-generation sequencing, thousands of lncRNAs have been identified in a small number of plants, such as Arabidopsis,17 tomato,22,Populus,23 wheat24 and maize.25 Recently, the regulatory mechanism of vernalization in Arabidopsis by COOLAIR (cool-assisted intronic ncRNA) and COLDAIR (cold-assisted intronic ncRNA), two lncRNAs transcribed from Flowering Locus C, has been illustrated.26 However, the functions of the majority of lncRNAs have not been fully studied to date.Sea buckthorn (Hippophae rhamnoides L.) is a pioneer plant for land reclamation, and its fruits have been used for nutritional purposes for many centuries in Russia, Europe and Asia due to their high contents of fat-soluble vitamins (A, K and E), fatty acids, amino acids, vitamins C, B1 and B2, folic acid and phenols. The berries of sea buckthorn contain high amounts of natural anti-oxidants including ascorbic acid (ASA), tocopherols, carotenoids and flavonoids, which are known to have beneficial effects on human health.27 Because of its various beneficial contents and significant ecological value, sea buckthorn has become an ideal material for both basic research and application. However, the number, expression pattern, and characteristics of lncRNAs in sea buckthorn remain largely unknown. Therefore, it is necessary and urgent to identify novel lncRNAs as well as their functions in sea buckthorn fruit development.Here, the whole transcriptome of three development stages fruit, including mature green (MG), breaker (BR) and red-ripe (RR), were analysed using multiple high-throughput sequencings and diverse bioinformatic platforms. Function and expression analysis revealed that the lncRNAs LNC1 and LNC2 can reduce and induce the expression of SPL9 and MYB114, respectively, to regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis and accumulation in sea buckthorn fruit.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsThe sea buckthorn plant ‘hongguo’ (H. rhamnoides L. subsp. Mongolica Rousi × chinensis Rousi) was used in this study. All sea buckthorn plants were planted in the desert forest experimental centre in Inner Mongolia, China. Healthy fresh sea buckthorn fruits were harvested at 46, 63 and 76 days post-anthesis, which respectively considered as MG, BR and RR stages. The whole fruit was quick-frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C. The sea buckthorn ‘hongguo’ was also planted for virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) in fruits.2.2. RNA extraction, library construction and sequencingTotal RNA was isolated from the MG, BR and RR fruits of ‘hongguo’ (three biological replicates per stages from two fruits each) using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Agarose gel electrophoresis was used for checking the RNA integrity. Then, total RNA was treated to remove rRNA using a kit. An Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer was used to measure the quantity and quality of retaining RNA without rRNA. Then, nine transcriptome libraries were constructed using the Ribo-Zero Kit (Illumina, USA) for mRNA and lncRNAs sequencing. In addition, total RNA was also isolated from the MG, BR and RR fruits of ‘hongguo’ using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, USA). And, small RNA library construction of each stage and Illumina high-throughput sequencing were performed according to past research.28 These libraries were run on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer (Illumina, USA).2.3. Transcriptome assembly and lncRNA identificationThe raw reads were trimmed and quality-filtered using FastQC tools (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/). Each RNA-seq sequence dataset was aligned to the whole sea buckthorn genome (unpublished) by using TopHat2.29 The transcripts from each dataset were assembled using the Cufflinks 2.0 program.30 Cuffmerge was used to pool and merge the final transcripts. Then, the abundance of all transcripts from the BAM output files, estimated using fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped reads (FPKM) values, were calculated using Cuffdiff.On the basis of the merged results, the remaining 654, 750 transcripts were used to identify the intergenic lncRNAs (lincRNAs), anti-sense lncRNAs (lncNATs) and intronic ncRNAs. The process was as follows: (i) Transcripts with an FPKM score <2 in a single exon or 0.5 in multiple exons in at least one sample were discarded; (ii) Transcripts with a length longer than 200 bp and an open reading frame (ORF) length shorter than 100 aa were retained; (iii) The CPC program was used to calculate the coding potential of the retained transcripts,31 and the transcripts with CPC scores >0 were discarded; (iv) HMMER32 was employed to scan the protein coding potential of each transcript against the Pfam protein family database with the transcript length >200 nucleotides, and no ORF encoding >100 amino acids; (v) The transcripts were compared against the NCBI non-redundant (NR) protein database, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database and the Swiss-Protein database (Swiss-Prot) by BLASTX (E-value = 1e-10, coverage > 85%, and identity > 95%) to retain transcripts without significant homology to known proteins. The raw reads generated have been deposited in the NCBI SRA database under accession numbers SRP124171 for the miRNA-Seq reads and the ssRNA-Seq reads.2.4. Differential expression of lncRNAs and mRNAsDifferentially expressed lncRNAs (DE-lncRNAs) between the samples at different developmental stages were identified using Cuffdiff. Any lncRNA exhibiting a log2-transformed |fold change| = 1 and adjusted P-value < 0.05 was selected as a DE-lncRNA. On the basis of the features of the lncRNAs, their localization and abundance were shown using Circos.332.5. Prediction and functional analysis of DE-lncRNA targetTo explore the functions of lncRNAs, we first predicted their cis and trans targets. In the cis role, lncRNAs act on neighbouring target genes. In this study, we searched for coding genes 100 kb upstream and downstream of a lncRNA. The trans role refers to the influence of lncRNAs on other genes at the expression level. Here, we calculated Pearson’s correlation coefficients between the expression levels of lncRNAs and mRNAs with custom scripts (|r| > 0.95). Then, we performed functional enrichment analysis of the target genes of lncRNAs by using goseq34 and KOBAS.352.6. Bioinformatics analysis of small RNAsAfter small RNA sequencing, low-quality reads, adapter-contaminating tags and reads with lengths smaller than 18 nt were discarded. All unique clean reads were considered for ncRNA (rRNA, scRNA, snoRNA, snRNA and tRNA) identification in a BLAST all search against the Rfam (version 10.1) database.36 Next, the remaining reads were compared with known miRNAs of plants deposited in miRbase.37 Then, the secondary structures of these miRNAs were predicted by RNAfold. The frequency of the miRNAs was normalized to transcripts per million (TPM) in each sample. Differentially expressed miRNAs were identified by log2-transformed |fold change| > 1 and P-value < 0.05. To explore whether mRNAs functioned as targets of miRNAs, the transcripts and identified miRNAs were submitted to psRobot with an expectation = 2.38 Transcripts containing a total of no more than four mismatches and G/U pairs within the complementary regions were considered as miRNA targets. The target mimics were predicted using psRNATarget combined with local scripts and the rules established by Wu et al.212.7. Construction of DE-lncRNA-miRNA-mRNA networkTo infer the functions of lncRNAs, networks were constructed based on the complementary pairs of miRNAs-lncRNAs and miRNAs-mRNAs. The DE-lncRNA–miRNA–mRNA network was reconstructed based on ceRNA theory. First, expression correlation between lncRNAs and mRNAs was evaluated using the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC). The lncRNA-mRNA pairs were considered as co-expression pairs with threshold PCC > 0.9 and P < 0.05. Then, for a lncRNA-mRNA pair, both mRNA and lncRNA, which as common miRNA targets and co-expressed negatively with this miRNA, were selected as co-expression competing triplet. Finally, all these co-expression competing triplets were used for constructing lncRNA–miRNA–mRNA network and visualized using Cytoscape software.392.8. qRT-PCR analysisThe total RNA from sea buckthorn fruit (MG, BR, RR) was used for quantitative PCR analysis. The RNA was then reverse transcribed to cDNA using ReverTra Ace reverse transcriptase (Toyobo). qRT-PCR of the randomly selected DE-lncRNAs was performed using a Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch™ RealTime PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad) with SYBR Green RealTime PCR Master Mix (ABI) according to the standard protocol. Specific primers for DE-lncRNAs and DE-miRNAs are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The 18S rRNA and U6 were used as the internal control genes for DE-lncRNAs and DE-miRNAs in these experiments. All reactions were conducted in triplicate for both technical and biological repetitions. The 2–<U+0394><U+0394>CT method was used to calculate the relative gene expression levels.2.9. Subcellular localization of LNC1/2The subcellular localization of two sea buckthorn DE-lncRNAs was examined using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). Sea buckthorn (‘hongguo’) fruits at RR stage were collected for FISH. We selected three healthy fresh fruits for subcellular localization of LNC1/2. The pipeline of subcellular localization was followed as previously described,40 including probe synthesis, sample fixation and probe hybridization. Firstly, the whole fruit are fixed with fixative: n-Heptan (1:1) solution. Then, to preserve tissue morphology, samples were rinsed in 75% (v/v) ethanol, 50% (v/v) ethanol/PBS and 25% (v/v) ethanol/PBS each for 10 min. Tissues are incubated in Hybridization Mix at 52°C. Afterwards, samples were rinsed in Washing Solution to remove non-specific and/or repetitive RNA hybridization, and analysed by microscopy. Two probe sequences are listed in Supplementary Table S2.2.10. VIGS of sea buckthorn fruitsAccording to previous study,16 VIGS of sea buckthorn fruit was performed using tobacco rattle virus (TRV). To avoid off-target silencing, we analysed LNC1 and LNC2 using the VIGS tool.16 A pTRV2-LNC1/2 construct was generated by inserting the EcoRI-digested PCR fragment of lncRNA into the pTRV2 vector. Agrobacterium strain GV3101 constructs containing pTRV1, pTRV2 and pTRV2-LNC1/LNC2 vectors were grown at 28°C in Luria Broth medium containing 10 mM MES, 20 µM acetosyringone, 50 µg ml-1 kanamycin and 50 µg ml-1 rifampicin. After shaking for 12 h, agrobacterium cells were harvested through centrifugation, resuspended in infiltration buffer (10 mM MgCl2, 200 µM acetosyringone and 5% sucrose) to a final OD600 of 1.0. Resuspensions of pTRV1 and pTRV2 or pTRV2-lncRNA were mixed at a ratio of 1:1. After 3 h of incubation, the agrobacterium was infiltrated into the fruits with a micro syringe. Sea buckthorn fruits infiltrated with pTRV1 and pTRV2 were used as controls (CK). Three different plants from each sample were used for infiltration. When the VIGS phenotype was visible, the sea buckthorn fruits were collected and stored at –80°C.2.11. qRT-PCR of lncRNAs, miRNAs and genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesisTotal RNA was extracted from the CK, TRV-LNC1 and TRV-LNC2 fruits using the Total RNA Kit (Aidlab, Beijing, China). Briefly, the first cDNA strand was obtained using the Prime Script™ RT Master Mix (Takara, Dalian, China). All primers used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. qRT-PCR was performed on the Bio-Rad CFX96 Touch™ RealTime PCR Detection System using a standard SYBR Green PCR Kit (Bio-Rad). The conditions for quantitative PCR and the primers for the lncRNAs and genes are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Sample cycle threshold (Ct) values were determined and standardized relative to the endogenous control gene 18S rRNA, and the 2–<U+0394><U+0394>CT method was used to calculate the relative changes in gene expression based on the qRT-PCR data. All reactions were carried out in three biological repetitions. qRT-PCR was used to validate the sequencing results of two miRNAs and the genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis. The quantitative PCR conditions and the primers for the miRNAs and genes are listed in Supplementary Table S1.2.12. Determination of anthocyanins by high-performance liquid chromatography analysisSea buckthorn fruit from CK, TRV-LNC1 and TRV-LNC2 plants was collected to quantify the content of anthocyanins. Each group included three biological repetitions. The method of anthocyanin determination was described in previous research.413. Results3.1. Identification and characterization of sea buckthorn lncRNAsBy integrating lncRNA computational identification methods, we developed a de novo lncRNA prediction pipeline using the resulting strand-specific RNA-seq (ssRNA-seq) data sets from three developmental stages of sea buckthorn (Supplementary Table S3; Supplementary Fig. S1). After mapping the RNA-seq data to the whole genome of sea buckthorn, we identified 9,008 lncRNAs in the fruits. The obtained lncRNAs were further classified into three types: lincRNAs, lncNATs and intronic lncRNAs, based on their locations to the protein coding genes. Whereas the majority of all lncRNAs (6,750) was located in intergenic regions, only 13.4% and 11.7% of all lncRNAs were intronic lncRNAs and lncNATs of protein-coding genes, respectively. A circos plot clearly showed that sea buckthorn lncRNAs were not evenly distributed across chromosomes (Fig. 1E), similar to the distribution of lncRNAs observed in other species.18,23,42 In addition, the expression level of lncRNAs varied between chromosomes. For instance, the average expression levels of lncRNAs generated from chromosomes 4 and 7 were 67.69 and 2.1415, respectively. Characteristics of sea buckthorn lncRNAs.

In the second, third and fourth track (outer to inner), each vertical line reports the expression of lncRNAs in sea buckthorn fruit in the MG, BR and RR stages, respectively.We compared the lengths of transcript and ORF and exon counts of the 9,008 putative lncRNAs with identified mRNAs. The length distribution of the identified lncRNAs (median 271 bp; average 463.28 bp) was shorter than that of the mRNAs (median 714 bp; average 976.08 bp), while the length distribution showed no significant differences among intergenic lncRNAs, intronic lncRNAs and lncNATs (Fig. 1A). The exon counts of the putative lncRNAs (average 1.56 exons per transcript) were also lower than those of the mRNAs (average 4.19 exons per transcript), while the exon counts of the three kinds of lncRNA showed no differences (Fig. 1B). We found the ORF lengths of the majority of lncRNAs were shorter than mRNAs (Fig. 1C).A total of 118 known lncRNAs and 108 novel transcripts were differentially expressed in the three samples (Supplementary Table S4). We also found fewer DE-lncRNAs (2.46%) than DE-mRNAs (5.64%, total mRNAs 45,546) in fruits at different development stages (Supplementary Table S5). This distinction indicated that lncRNAs might have a different expression pattern from protein-coding genes. Only two and 36 DE-lncRNAs were expressed specifically in the MG and RR stage, respectively (Fig. 1D). In contrast to MG, 38 and 72 lncRNAs were upregulated in BR or RR, and the remaining 44 and 46 lncRNAs were downregulated.3.2. Functional analysis of DE-lncRNAsTo investigate the functions of DE-lncRNAs, we predicted the potential cis and trans targets of the lncRNAs. For the cis action of lncRNAs, computational prediction identified 1,061 potential target genes for 84 DE-lncRNAs (Supplementary Table S6). Gene Ontology (GO) analysis revealed that cis lncRNA targets significantly represented in the developmental process (Supplementary Fig. S2). Moreover, pathway analysis showed that these cis target genes of lncRNAs were enriched in plant hormone signal transduction, fatty acid and unsaturated fatty acid metabolism, carotenoid biosynthesis and flavonoid biosynthesis (Supplementary Table S7). On the other hand, the trans functions of 67 DE-lncRNAs were examined based on their expression correlation coefficients (|Pearson correlation| = 0.95) with protein-coding genes. A total of 21,772 interactions were detected in trans between 67 DE-lncRNAs and 782 protein-coding genes in the sea buckthorn genome (Supplementary Table S8). Functional analysis showed that the trans target genes were also enriched in a variety of biological processes. Importantly, we observed a few plant growth terms, including the regulation of growth, cell wall organization or biogenesis, and regulation of cellular component organization. Of the identified 110 KEGG pathways, five were associated with fruit development, namely, ascorbate and aldarate metabolism, flavonoid biosynthesis and brassinosteroid biosynthesis (Supplementary Table S9).3.3. DE-lncRNAs participate in miRNA-lncRNA-mRNA networksRecent evidence suggested the roles of miRNAs and lncRNAs in regulating the expression of mRNAs in many species,43–45 but the comprehensive patterns of miRNA and lncRNAs in sea buckthorn remain unknown. We predicted 68 conserved miRNAs and 79 pre-miRNAs, which were identified as belonging to 31 known miRNA families deposited in miRBase. A total of 32 DE-miRNAs were predicted to target 67 genes in this study (Supplementary Table S10). The target prediction analysis revealed that 22 lncRNAs may act as eTMs of 25 DE-miRNAs (Supplementary Table S11). Recently, some researches have shown that lncRNAs can affect the regulation of miRNAs as eTMs in plants.21,46 To investigate the function of lncRNAs as miRNA targets, a comprehensive genome-wide network mediated by miRNAs was constructed. The network consisted of 109 nodes and 201 edges, including 13 DE-miRNAs, 10 DE-lncRNAs and 87 DE-mRNAs (Fig. 2A). The majority of the nodes in the network belonged to the miR396 family, which regulates growth by targeting growth regulation factors. Then, the function of each lncRNA was inferred based on the functions of the connected mRNAs. We found that lncRNAs mainly participate in cellular, metabolic and some biological processes, especially highly enriched in cellular component, binding including ‘ion binding’, ‘nucleotide binding’ and ‘small molecule binding’ (Supplementary Table S12).

Analysis of lncRNAs related to the anthocyanin biosynthesis of fruitsAccording to previous studies, the module miR156-SPL affects anthocyanin biosynthesis in plants.47 Additionally, R2R3-MYBs (MYB114) are known to combine with bHLHs and WDR to form a ternary complex that activates late biosynthesis genes and transfers protein genes.48 Here, based on the miRNA-lncRNA-mRNA network, we identified two anthocyanin biosynthesis-related lncRNAs (TCONS_00694050 and TCONS_00438839, termed LNC1 and LNC2) for further analysis (Fig. 2). On the basis of the network, we found that LNC1 and LNC2 may regulate the expression of SPL9 and MYB114 by acting as eTMs of miR156a and miR828a.To validate the putative relationships between the miRNAs and lncRNAs, their expression levels were examined by qRT-PCR (Fig. 3). The qRT-PCR results were consistent with our RNA-seq data regarding lncRNA and miRNA expression, suggesting that these two lncRNAs identified by next-generation sequencing might have negative regulation relation with miR156a and miR828a. Distribution analysis is an important step towards functional research on lncRNAs as eTMs. To demonstrate the subcellular localization of LNC1 and LNC2, FISH was performed in fruits using a fluorescence probe specific to LNC1 and LNC2. In combination with the DAPI signal, the probe showed that these two lncRNAs were mainly enriched in cytoplasm (Fig. 4A). Genome chromosomal location analyses revealed that both LNC1 and LNC2 reside in chromosome 1 and lack homologs compared with other plants (Fig. 4B). qRT-PCR validation of putative lncRNAs and miRNAs in sea buckthorn.

LNC1 and LNC2 regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in fruitsTo test the regulation role of LNC1 and LNC2 in anthocyanin biosynthesis, VIGS was performed to silence LNC1 and LNC2 in sea buckthorn fruits (Fig. 5A). Intriguingly, two or three weeks after infiltration, anthocyanin contents of sea buckthorn fruits injected with TRV-LNC1 or TRV-LNC2 showed significant difference compared with that of control fruits injected with TRV (Fig. 5B). Semi-quantitative PCR analysis suggested that a recombinant virus could spread from carpogonia to fruits, resulting in the VIGS of lncRNAs in sea buckthorn fruits. Compared with that in TRV control fruits, the transcript level of LNC1 in TRV-LNC1 fruits was dramatically decreased by 96% (Fig. 5C). Similarly, the level of LNC2 in TRV-LNC2 fruits decreased by 63.3% compared with that in TRV control fruits (Fig. 5C). Consistently, the anthocyanin content of TRV-LNC1 fruit increased by 25.23% with respect to TRV control fruits, and the anthocyanin content of TRV-LNC2 fruit decreased by 39.12% with respect to TRV control fruits (Fig. 5C). Previous studies have reported that SPL and MYB transcription factors can affect anthocyanin content by regulating the expression of genes involved into anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway, such as ANS, DFR, F3'H, LDOX, UGT78D2 and UGT75C1.48 Similarly, three genes involved in anthocyanin biosynthesis were increased or decreased in TRV-LNC1 compared with their levels in TRV control sea buckthorn fruits (Fig. 5C). In contrast, DFR, F3'H and LDOX were decreased in TRV-LNC2 compared with their levels in TRV control sea buckthorn fruits (Fig. 5C). These results strongly suggested the essential role of the two novel lncRNAs in the regulation of the anthocyanin accumulation of sea buckthorn fruits. Silencing of LNC1/2 in sea buckthorn fruit.

Discussion4.1. A reliable list of lncRNAs from sea buckthorn fruitsRecently, plenty of studies have revealed the crucial roles of lncRNAs in various biological processes in plants.17,45,49 Although many lncRNAs have been identified in model plants, such as Arabidopsis,50 rice,51 and maize,25 little research has been performed on sea buckthorn. In this study, a total of 9008 lncRNA loci were identified in the fruit of sea buckthorn, an ideal material for the study of fruit development. Furthermore, structural analysis showed that the mean length of lncRNAs was 1.1-fold shorter than that of coding transcripts, and the lncRNA expression level was lower than that of coding transcripts, in agreement with previous studies.16,42,52 LncRNAs also have specific expression patterns in tissue types and subcellular compartments. In our study, among the significant DE-lncRNAs, we found five expression patterns in MG, BR and RR.4.2. DE-lncRNAs contribute to fruit development of sea buckthorn fruitTranscriptomic sequencing of different varieties of sea buckthorn revealed a lot of ncRNAs in many biological processes.28,53 In this study, we predicted potential cis and trans target genes based on physical location and expression relationships with mRNA, respectively. Although the functions of the majority of lncRNAs are unknown, previous studies have suggested that lncRNAs may play different roles in a variety of biological processes. According to previous study,21 we analysed the functions of DE-lncRNAs based on their target mRNAs, which involved in many processes, including carotenoid, ASA, flavonoid, sugar and hormone pathways.We identified 10 DE-lncRNAs involved in carotenoid biosynthesis pathways, including ß-carotenoid and lycopene biosynthesis. Among these DE-lncRNAs, one lncRNA (TCONS_00082246) targeted the phytoene synthase (PSY) gene, which is involved in the first committed step in carotenoid biosynthesis (Supplementary Table S12). This reaction has been reported to be the rate-limiting step controlling the metabolic flux to carotenoid biosynthesis in many plants.54 For example, the PSY gene plays an important role in carotenoid biosynthesis in tomato.12 Therefore, this study opened the door to understanding the role of lncRNAs in the regulation of genes involved in carotenoid biosynthesis in sea buckthorn fruit. Recently, many studies have shown that carotenoids are considered as the main fruit pigments in tomato, bilberry, citrus, papaya, watermelon and sea buckthorn.55–57 In addition, lycopene accumulation is the most important reason for the pigmentation of red fruit in sea buckthorn. Therefore, these results revealed that lncRNAs may play roles in the development of sea buckthorn fruit pigmentation.Sea buckthorn fruit contains abundant ASA and is known as the king of vitamin C, and ASA is a prominent product of the ascorbate and aldarate metabolism pathway. In this pathway, we found seven lncRNAs targeting GDP-mannose-epimerase (GME) and SKS12, which encodes l-ascorbate oxidase. Several studies have revealed that GME and SKS12 are associated with the accumulation of ASA in the fruits of many plants, including blueberry, Arabidopsis, tomato and peach.58–61 For instance, the importance of GME in the major ascorbate biosynthesis pathway in tomato was confirmed using gene-silencing technology.62 Thus, our results provide a resource for further analysis of the regulation of ASA biosynthesis in sea buckthorn fruit.Flavonoids are a large group of natural products that are widely present in the leaves, flowers, fruits and seeds of various plants. According to their basic chemical structures, flavonoids can be further divided into different subgroups, including flavonols, anthocyanins and proanthocyanidins. Our results consistent with those of previous studies, reveal that sea buckthorn fruit contains various flavonoids. In the flavonoid biosynthesis pathway, chalcone synthase (CHS) is the first committed enzyme that facilitates the stepwise synthesis of chalcone, and it is also pivotal for the biosynthesis of flavonoid and anthocyanin pigments in plants.63 TCONS_00085219 was predicted to target CHS, indicating a possible regulatory relationship between lncRNA and CHS (Fig. 6). Another important enzyme involved in this pathway is flavanone 3-hydroxylase (F3H), which was reported in rice.58 TCONS_01039552 was predicted to target F3H, implying a potential role in flavonol and anthocyanin biosynthesis through the regulation of F3H. In addition to CHS and F3H, other important genes, such as the gene encoding flavonol synthase 1, were predicted as target genes of two lncRNAs (TCONS_00061167 and TCONS_00061354) identified in our study. All these results implied the widespread involvement of lncRNAs in the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis and fruit pigment in the development of sea buckthorn fruit, which will provide novel insight into the regulation of flavonoid biosynthesis in other plants. Model of lncRNA regulation in sea buckthorn fruit. This pathway begins with the general phenylpropanoid metabolism, and subsequent steps are catalyzed by a series of structural enzymes, leading to the biosynthesis of flavonols and anthocyanins. The expression of the late biosynthetic genes (LBGs) requires the transcriptional activation activity of the R2R3-MYB/bHLH/WDR (MBW) complex. LncRNAs target FLS and CHS: functions in trans regulation. LncRNAs target F3H and F3'H: functions in cis regulation.

LNC1 and LNC2 regulate anthocyanin biosynthesis in the fruit development of sea buckthorn by eTMsPrevious studies suggest that lncRNAs function via interacting with miRNAs.21 The reverse miRNA-lncRNA regulation, first discovered in Arabidopsis, was termed target mimicry.64 Previous research systematically identified 36 eTMs for 11 Arabidopsis miRNAs and 189 target mimics for 19 rice miRNAs.21,51 In Populus, seven miRNAs target TCONS_00013609, including pto-miR6462a/b/c.60 Therefore, the prediction and analysis of miRNAs that interact with lncRNAs provide a useful way to explore the functions of the corresponding lncRNAs. In this study, we identified 19 DE-lncRNA eTMs for 23 DE-miRNAs (seven families). These results first showed that miRNAs target lncRNAs in sea buckthorn. Furthermore, our investigation constructed a comprehensive RNA-mediated network, including DE-miRNA–DE-lncRNA and DE-miRNA–DE-mRNA interactions.However, a mechanistic understanding of the roles of lncRNAs in plants, especially trees, has remained extremely lacking. lncRNA1459 and lncRNA1840 were found to regulate the ripening of tomato.16 For mammal, lnc-mg was identified to promote myogenesis by functioning as a ceRNA/eTM for microRNA-125b to control the protein abundance of insulin-like growth factor 2.65 In Arabidopsis, a representation of the classical TM model, miR399: IPS1, was discovered by Franco-Zorrilla.64 Few studies have reported on the mechanism of lncRNA involvement in anthocyanin biosynthesis during fruit development. In this study, we identified two lncRNAs (LNC1 and LNC2) involved in the anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway (Fig. 6). Additionally, we first used FISH and VIGS for function analysis of lncRNAs in sea buckthorn. The VIGS results provide strong evidence that these two lncRNAs function in fruit anthocyanin biosynthesis. When LNC1 and LNC2 expression is reduced, anthocyanin accumulation is increased or decreased, respectively. This mechanism shows that anthocyanin accumulation is regulated through the LNC1-induced downregulation of SPL9, which affects the stability of the MYB, bHLH and WDR (MBW) complex, thus promoting anthocyanin biosynthesis in sea buckhorn fruit. In contrast, the LNC2-induced downregulation of MYB114 reduced anthocyanin biosynthesis in sea buckhorn fruit. Thus, this study illuminated the complex regulation of fruit anthocyanin biosynthesis, which might instigate more comprehensive studies on sea buckthorn lncRNAs. Furthermore, the functional motifs and target genes of lncRNAs in trees need to be investigated further to fully elucidate the regulatory mechanisms of lncRNAs in trees.Conflict of interestNone declared.FundingThis study was supported by grants from Special Fund for Forest Scientific Research in the Public Welfare (201504103) and the National Natural Science Foundation of China (31470616).Supplementary data"

The high efficiency and the unique features of this MMLV-RT activity that enables the labelling of each DNA molecule with a unique degenerate sequence as a molecular identifier has many potential uses in biotechnology.1. IntroductionVarious fundamental DNA-handling techniques using the enzymatic activities of restriction enzymes, ligases, kinases, phosphatases, and DNA polymerases have been developed and combined for different biotechnological purposes.1 The addition of an enzymatic activity that catalyses a novel reaction would increase the applicability of the currently available genetic tools and establish a base on which a number of new methodologies could be founded.Reverse transcriptases (RT) from different origins such as human immunodeficiency virus Type-1 and Moloney murine leukaemia virus (MMLV),2 has been shown to have clamping activity, which stabilizes a short duplex of dinucleotide at the 3' tail of a double-stranded DNA and the 3' end of a single-stranded DNA.3–5 The clamping activity enables RT-mediated DNA synthesis of the complementary strand of the single-stranded DNA, as well as the strand displacement synthesis originating from the single-stranded DNA.3 However, the efficiency of the overall reaction (hereafter CIS reaction; clamping-mediated incorporation of single-stranded DNA with concomitant DNA syntheses) have been low, leaving a high fraction of DNA unreacted,3 and thereby leaving its potential as a biotechnological tool unrealized.MMLV-RT has been shown to catalyse a range of unique reactions; one such being the ‘template switching’ reaction that has been utilized for the efficient cloning of cDNA.6,7 The template switching occurs when the reverse transcribing MMLV-RT reaches the 5' end of the RNA where it preferentially adds, in a template-independent fashion, a few dCMPs to the 3' end of the newly synthesized cDNA. Then, in the presence of a single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) with a stretch of guanosine monophosphates (GMPs), referred to as a template switching oligo (TSO), MMLV-RT switches the template from RNA to the TSO and continues to incorporate deoxyribonucleotides that are complementary to the TSO, thereby extending the cDNA strand. Upon reaching the TSO end, MMLV-RT appends another 3' tail consisting of dCMPs, to which another TSO (carrying 3' GMPs) is incorporated, resulting in a concatenated end.8MMLV-RT also has unusually strong tailing activity. In a previous study, we had optimized the tailing reaction conditions and shown that MMLV-RT appends to blunt double-stranded DNA ends with a 3' tail of A, C, G, or T residues in a template-independent fashion.9 We also identified specific compounds that enhance C-, G-, and T-tailing reactions, thus enabling the appending of a tail composed of ~3 Cs and Ts and 4–5 Gs.10 For the A-tailing reaction, specific enhancers have not been found but MMLV-RT inherently appends up to ~4 As. Importantly, most of the DNA molecules in the reaction mixture are tailed, apparently leaving no DNA substrates unreacted.It has not been addressed whether the template switching reaction of MMLV-RT involves a dynamic process, in which MMLV-RT molecule that has just finished reverse transcription (or DNA-dependent DNA polymerization) with its specific protein dynamics exerts the tailing and concomitant switching reaction. In addition, it has not been clear whether the performing of the tailing reaction by an MMLV-RT molecule is prerequisite for it to conduct subsequent template switching. The low efficiency of the reported CIS-reaction,3 might be due to the lack of those dynamic processes, or to lack of stable interaction between the tail and incoming single-stranded DNA molecule (hereafter GAO; guide adaptor oligonucleotide), or to the intrinsic nature of MMLV-RT that can efficiently conduct CIS reaction on RNA-DNA hybrid end but not on double-stranded DNA end.As we could extend the tail lengths,9,10 we tested, in this study, the possibility that the extended tail increase the CIS reaction efficiency. Since this was the case, to establish a fundamental DNA manipulation technique to append a DNA of given nucleotide sequence to a blunt-end DNA, we sought for the ideal CIS reaction conditions including the best combination of the 3' tail and GAO nucleotides, and investigated whether longer tails result in higher efficiency, and investigated the length of GAO that can be efficiently incorporated. The efficiency of the CIS reaction using a model DNA substrate reached almost 100% suggesting it to be useful for different biotechnological applications.2. Materials and methods2.1. Tailing reactionsThe tailing reactions were conducted based on our previous reports.9,10 Wild-type MMLV-RT (200 U/µl) was purchased from Nippon Gene (Japan). The reaction mixture contained, in a total volume of 10 µl, 100 fmols to 1 pmol substrate DNA; 50 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.3; 75 mM KCl; 6 mM MgCl2; 2 mM DTT; 4 mM dATP, dCTP, dGTP, or dTTP; 4 mM MnCl2; and 50 U MMLV-RT. Reactions were carried out in PCR tubes using a thermal cycler (C1000; Bio-Rad, USA) at 30°C. To enhance tailing, 200 mM deoxycytidine (for G-tailing), 40% saturated concentrations of deoxyguanosine (~5 mM; for C-tailing), or deoxyadenosine (~20 mM; for T-tailing) was added. We always added MnCl2 just before adding the MMLV-RT and used fresh DTT. The tailing reaction was conducted at 30°C for 5–90 min and terminated by phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol extraction or by adding a salt solution for the subsequent purification of DNA using a DNA-binding column.2.2. CIS reactionThe CIS reaction mixture contained, in a total volume of 10 µl, 100 fmol tailed DNA substrate, 0.25 mM each of dNTPs, 2 pmol GAO, 50 units of MMLV-RT, 50 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.3, 75 mM KCl, 6 mM MgCl2, and 2 mM DTT. The solutions for the DNA substrate and GAO were mixed and kept at room temperature (25°C) and added to the rest of the reaction mixture kept at the same temperature. After it was mixed by tapping the tube, the reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C.2.3. ReagentsStreptavidin was purchased from Nacalai Tesuque (Japan) and dissolved in PBS buffer. T4 DNA polymerase was purchased from Takara (Japan).2.4. Preparation of FAM70 and 33G0 to 33G4FAM70 DNA was prepared as described previously.9 Briefly, a 5'-FAM-labelled primer was used to amplify a 300-bp fragment, and the fragment was digested by PvuII to generate a 70-bp blunt-end fragment bearing FAM at one 5' end; the fragment was then purified by 15% polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. The opposite 3' end of the FAM-labelled strand was the tailing target, and the 5' end adjacent to the tailing target carried a phosphate group.Five types of oligonucleotides (SA606 and SA677-SA680, see Fig. 3) bearing FAM at the 5' end were annealed with SA659, purified as described earlier, and designated as 33G0 to 33G4. The concentrations of FAM70 and 33G0 to 33G4 were determined by measuring FAM fluorescence with an Infinite 200 Fluorescence Spectrophotometer (Tecan, Switzerland) using a FAM-labelled oligonucleotide (SA560) as a standard.2.5. DNA length analysis using a capillary sequencer and data analysisThe length analysis was performed as described previously.9,10 To 1 ml of HiDi formamide, 10 µl of GeneScan-500 LIZ Size Standard (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA), which contains 16 fragments of known sizes, was added to prepare HiDi-LIZ500. To 12.5 µl of HiDi-LIZ500, 0.5 µl of a reaction mixture was added, or when purified DNA samples were analysed, DNA samples were diluted with water, and DNA not exceeding 0.5 fmol was added. The samples were heat denatured at 96°C for 1 min and analysed with a 3130xl Genetic Analyzer (Thermo Fisher Scientific, USA) with a 50-cm capillary array and POP7 polymer. The data obtained were analysed using TraceViewer software,9 and two LIZ bands were chosen to calibrate the electropherogram. Peak areas were determined using TraceViewer software, and GAO incorporation rates were calculated by dividing sum of peak area of CIS reaction products by total peak area. When peaks corresponding to concatenated products were observed, those peaks were also counted as CIS reaction products.2.6. Preparation of a size controlFAM70 DNA and SA682 (5'-GACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTCCCCCCCTGTCTCTTATACACATCTGACGC-3'; nucleotides complementary to the FAM70 end are in bold type, and intervening Cs are underlined) were mixed and annealed by heating and cooling and then extended by ExTaq DNA polymerase (TAKARA, Japan) for 10 min at 50°C. The product was used as a template for PCR amplification using the primers SA560 (FAM-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACAC-3') and SA574 (5'-GACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCTCCCCCC-3') to amplify a 96-bp DNA fragment, which served as a size control.3. Results3.1. Schematic representation of CIS reactionIn this study, we explored the optimal CIS reaction conditions, and the highest efficiency close to 100% was observed when extensively G-tailed dsDNA was reacted with a GAO carrying a 3' stretch of Cs, which is contrasted to the template switching reaction (see above). Figure 1a shows an example of the CIS reaction that was conducted with the optimized protocol, and Fig. 1b shows a schematic representation of the reaction, with the horizontal scale applicable to both panels. In this example, 70-bp blunt-end DNA, carrying the FAM fluorophore on one of its 5' ends (FAM70), was subjected to G-tailing, resulting in a DNA product that mostly carried a tail containing four Gs (see the major peak denoted as ‘FAM70 + 4G’ with two minor accompanying peaks of +3G and +5G). In the CIS reaction, a GAO annealed with the 4G-tail, and MMLV-RT catalysed DNA polymerization to synthesize the complementary strand of the GAO. Upon reaching the GAO end, MMLV-RT appended a 3' tail through its tailing activity, resulting in a 3'-overhang in a template-independent fashion (see the two peaks marked with ‘+1’ and ‘+2’ that are 1 and 2 nucleotides larger than the size control, respectively). To the newly appended tail, another GAO was incorporated, resulting in a concatenated end (marked with *). In the reaction, the 3' end of the GAO was used for strand-displacing synthesis.

(a) Electropherograms obtained by analysing the samples by a capillary sequencer are shown; x-axis represents the retention time and y-axis represents the fluorescence signal intensity.

The two panels share the same x-axis.After blunting of the product, the peaks shifted to the left, and the size of the largest peak matched that of the size control, demonstrating that a tail 1–2 nucleotides long had formed (see discussion for the other accompanying peaks). Notably, most of the DNA ends were appended with the GAO, as indicated by a tiny peak at the position of FAM70 (see the products of the blunting reaction in panel A).3.2. CIS reaction conditionsThe CIS reaction was initiated by mixing two solutions at room temperature (25°C); one contained pre-tailed 100 fmol of DNA substrate and 2 pmol GAO and the other contained the rest of the reaction components, including MMLV-RT, dNTPs, and DTT. After mixing, the samples were transferred to 37°C and incubated. This protocol gave satisfactory results (see below) and was used as a standard protocol throughout this study.3.3. G- and C-tailed DNA ends are good CIS reaction substratesTo find the best combination of nucleotides for dsDNA 3' tail and GAO 3' end, we evaluated the efficiency with which A-, C-, G-, or T-tailed dsDNA was appended with a GAO carrying a stretch of Ts, Gs, Cs, or As at its 3' end, respectively. In the first step of the experiment, a 70-bp blunt-end DNA carrying the FAM fluorophore at one of its 5' ends (FAM70; the first line in each panel of Fig. 2) was subjected to A-, C-, G-, or T-tailing (see the second line in each panel of Fig. 2 for tail length distributions). Each tailing reaction was terminated by phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation. In the second step, the tailed-DNA was reacted with the GAO carrying a stretch of nucleotides complementary to the tail. The lengths of the complementary nucleotides were 4 for A, T, and G and 6 for C. The longer C-stretch was used to respond to the longer G-tail that exceeded four nucleotides long. Each reaction product was analysed with a capillary sequencer, and the resulting electropherogram was analysed using TraceViewer software. In the CIS reaction, G- or C-tailed DNA acquired the GAO efficiently. FAM70 DNA (a 70-bp dsDNA carrying FAM at one 5' end) was subjected to A-, C-, G-, or T-tailing and then purified by phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation. The tailing reactions produced tails of different lengths; some of the peaks are labelled with the number of nucleotides added. Each of the tailed DNAs was reacted with the indicated GAO carrying a stretch of nucleotides complementary to the tail (underlined). At different time points, a portion of the reaction mixture was taken for analysis under denaturing conditions to investigate the length of the FAM-labelled strand. The panels present the results of A-tailing (a), C-tailing (b), G-tailing (c), and T-tailing (d) of FAM70 DNA and the subsequent CIS reaction with SA597 (a), SA593 (b), SA574 (c), and SA601 (d). In each panel, the electropherogram of unreacted FAM70 DNA and the tailing reaction product are also shown. Single asterisks (*) indicate the CIS reaction products, and double asterisks (**) indicate concatenated products. The CIS reaction products were observed as multiple peaks, which resulted from additional tailing reactions.

Single asterisks (*) indicate the CIS reaction products, and double asterisks (**) indicate concatenated products. The CIS reaction products were observed as multiple peaks, which resulted from additional tailing reactions. Note that the sampling time points are different in panels (a, d) and (b, c).As shown in Fig. 2, all types of tails analysed reacted with the corresponding GAO; however, regarding the reaction speed and yield, C- and G-tailed dsDNAs reacted well with the GAO, and A- and T-tailed dsDNAs reacted far less efficiently. For example, in our experimental setup using 100 fmol G-tailed DNA and 50 units of MMLV-RT in a 10-µl reaction, the GAO was appended to nearly 100% of G-tailed dsDNAs within a minute. In contrast, 30% of A-tailed DNAs remained unreacted even after 50 min of incubation (sum of multiple peak areas corresponding to the CIS products was divided by the total peak area). Moreover, G-tailed DNA reacted slightly better than C-tailed DNA [see weak signals representing unreacted substrates in panel (b)], and yielded less concatenated products [marked with double asterisks (**) in Fig. 2].3.4. A longer 3'-tail is favourable for the CIS reactionTo determine whether a longer 3' tail is favourable for the CIS reaction, 33-bp dsDNAs with 3' G-tails 0–4 nucleotides long (33G0 to 33G4; see Fig. 3a) were reacted with GAO SA574. The results shown in Fig. 3a clearly indicate that the longer the tail was, the higher the efficiency. To further clarify this, FAM70 DNA was G- or C-tailed in the presence (marked FAM70G+ and FAM70C+ in Fig. 3b and c, respectively) or absence of a cognate tailing-enhancer,10 and the tailed product was reacted with a corresponding GAO (Fig. 3b and c). Again, longer 3' tails were more favourable for CIS reaction. Longer tails are favourable for the CIS reaction. (a) Double-stranded DNAs 33G0 to 33G4, which are 33 base pairs long plus a 3' tail of 0–4 Gs (carries FAM at the 5' end of the G-tail strand), were subjected to the CIS reaction with GAO SA574. At the different time points, a portion of the reaction mixture was taken for analysis using a capillary sequencer, and the GAO incorporation rate was calculated as described in the materials and methods. (b) FAM70 DNA was G-tailed in the presence (FAM70G+) or absence (FAM70G) of the tailing enhancer deoxycytidine, purified by phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation, and then reacted with SA574. (c) FAM70 DNA was C-tailed in the presence (FAM70C+) or absence (FAM70C) of the tailing enhancer deoxyguanosine, purified, and reacted with GAO SA593. Values are the average of triplicate experiments, and standard deviations are shown.Longer tails are favourable for the CIS reaction.

Values are the average of triplicate experiments, and standard deviations are shown.3.5. Ribonucleotides at the GAO 3' end facilitate the CIS reactionIn template switching reactions, oligonucleotides with a few ribonucleotides11 or locked-nucleotides12 at their 3' end are often used to improve the reaction efficiency, possibly by increasing the thermostability between the tail and the 3' end of the oligonucleotides. To assess the effect of replacing the 3' deoxyribonucleotides of GAO with ribonucleotides on the CIS reaction, FAM70 DNA tailed with C or G in the absence of enhancers was reacted with a GAO that carried rGrGrG or rCrCrC at its 3' end (the lower case ‘r’ indicates ‘ribonucleotide’).Figure 4a shows that GAO with ribonucleotides reacted more efficiently than its deoxynucleotidyl counterpart, i.e. G-tailed DNA (FAM70G) reacted faster with SA671 (carrying dCrCrCrC at its 3' end) than with SA673 (carrying dCdCdCdC at its 3' end), and C-tailed DNA (FAM70C) reacted faster with SA670 (carrying rGrGrG at its 3' end) than with SA672 (carrying dGdGdG at its 3' end). The superiority of the ribonucleotidyl GAO to deoxyribonucleotidyl GAO was also observed when a dsDNA with a longer G-tail was tested (Fig. 4b). A tailed 33G4 DNA (carrying four Gs as a tail) reacted faster with SA671 than with SA673. Likewise, FAM70 DNA subjected to C-tailing in the presence of an enhancer (C3, 55%; C4, 44%) reacted faster with SA670 than with SA672 (Fig. 4c). GAOs carrying 3' ribonucleotides react more efficiently. G-tailed FAM70 DNA (G298%) or C-tailed FAM70 DNA (C182%C212%C35%) prepared by a tailing reaction conducted in the absence of a tailing enhancer (a), 33G4 DNA (b), and C-tailed FAM70 DNA (C356%C444%) in the presence of the tailing enhancer deoxyguanosine (c) were reacted with the indicated GAOs. Values are the average of triplicate experiments, and standard deviations are shown. SA670 and SA672 are equivalent to TS-oligo-rG3 and TS-oligo-dG3, respectively, in reference.6GAOs carrying 3' ribonucleotides react more efficiently. G-tailed FAM70 DNA (G298%) or C-tailed FAM70 DNA (C182%C212%C35%) prepared by a tailing reaction conducted in the absence of a tailing enhancer (a), 33G4 DNA (b), and C-tailed FAM70 DNA (C356%C444%) in the presence of the tailing enhancer deoxyguanosine (c) were reacted with the indicated GAOs. Values are the average of triplicate experiments, and standard deviations are shown. SA670 and SA672 are equivalent to TS-oligo-rG3 and TS-oligo-dG3, respectively, in reference.63.6. 5' biotin on GAO inhibits concatenationBecause GAO concatenation might compromize the downstream application of CIS reaction products, its suppression is desirable. GAO concatenation might also arise through the annealing of two GAOs and complementary strand synthesis by MMLV-RT and subsequent tailing and the CIS reaction.We found that 5'-biotinylated GAO (SA686) suppressed the concatenation (Fig. 5). In Fig. 5, when unbiotinylated GAO (SA574) was used, peaks representing the concatenated products were observed (marked with ** in Fig. 5). In contrast, when biotinylated GAO (SA686) was used, no concatenated products were observed. Originally, we expected that the addition of streptavidin to the reaction mixture containing biotinylated GAO would lead to the formation of a macromolecular complex that might exclude the MMLV-RT from the 5' end of the GAO by steric hindrance, thereby inhibiting the concatenation. Contrary to our expectation, even in the absence of streptavidin, biotinylated GAO suppressed the concatenation. However, the addition of streptavidin to the reaction using SA686 changed the peak profile of the CIS reaction product (Fig. 5), indicating that the strand synthesis of the last few bases was suppressed by the biotin-streptavidin complex. Biotin labelling at the GAO 5' end prevented concatenation. FAM70 DNA was G-tailed (G480%G520%) and purified using a DNA purification column. Two types of GAOs, SA574 and SA686, with SA686 bearing a biotin moiety at its 5' end, were reacted with the G-tailed DNA for 20 min in the presence or absence of 10 pmol streptavidin. The single asterisk (*) indicates the CIS reaction product, and parts of the data were magnified 10-fold to show the concatenated products (**). Note that, under the denaturing conditions of the capillary sequencer, the FAM-labelled strand is dissociated from the biotinylated strand.Biotin labelling at the GAO 5' end prevented concatenation.

Fate of the GAO in the CIS reactionIn this study, we confirmed the strand displacement synthesis by RTs that originates from the 3' end of GAO followed by the clamping of the 3' tail of dsDNA and 3'-end nucleotides of the single-stranded DNA.3 A GAO (SA701) with a Cy3-labelled 5'-end was reacted with a G-tailed DNA and then analysed to see the extended Cy3-labelled fragments. To exclude the unreacted GAO, the reaction product was subjected to polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis, and the band with the expected size of the CIS reaction product was excised, purified, and analysed with a capillary sequencer under denaturing conditions. As shown in Fig. 6, the GAO strand was extended as demonstrated by the appearance of peaks that were located close to the peaks for the CIS reaction product of the FAM-labelled upper strand. The slight difference in the electrophoretic mobilities of FAM and the Cy3-labelled strand might reflect the different nucleotide compositions of the strands. The peak area ratio of the Cy3 to FAM signals was close to the ratio of 0.25 obtained when running equimolar Cy3 or FAM-labelled single-stranded DNA (data not shown), indicating that most of the GAO molecules were incorporated into the target DNA that underwent strand extension. Because MMLV-RT has not been reported to have 5' -> 3' exonuclease activity, this extension might represent the strand-displacing synthesis that MMLV-RT catalyses during cDNA synthesis. GAO is incorporated into the target DNA end. FAM70 DNA (a) was G-tailed (G489%G511%) in the presence of the enhancer deoxycytidine (b) and then reacted in a CIS reaction with GAO SA701, which carries a Cy3 label at its 5' end. The CIS reaction product was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then analysed (c). As a size control, SA701 was also analysed (d). The Cy3 signals are indicated by asterisks.GAO is incorporated into the target DNA end.

The CIS reaction product was purified by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and then analysed (c). As a size control, SA701 was also analysed (d). The Cy3 signals are indicated by asterisks.The extension from the 3' end of the GAO is not necessary for the CIS reaction because a GAO with a 2', 3'-dideoxy end was incorporated at a rate very similar to that of a GAO with a 2' deoxy end (data not shown).3.8. GAO lengths and efficienciesIn practical use, GAOs with different lengths might be to be incorporated. To investigate the effect of GAO length on CIS reaction efficiency, eight types of GAOs with different lengths ranging from 19 to 72 nucleotides long were reacted with G-tailed FAM70 DNA (G480%G520%). As shown in Fig. 7, GAO length did not seem to affect the reaction efficiency, and 98% of the DNA ends underwent the CIS reaction. G-tailed DNA end efficiently acquired GAOs of different lengths. G-tailed FAM70 DNA (G480%G520%) was reacted with GAOs SA725 to SA732 of different lengths for 5 min and then purified using DNA purification columns. The purification product was further subjected to blunting by T4 DNA polymerase and then analysed. Asterisks indicate the concatenated products, and the arrow indicates the peaks of the original size (70 nucleotides).G-tailed DNA end efficiently acquired GAOs of different lengths.

Concentrations of G-tailed substrate and efficienciesA series of concentrations of a G-tailed DNA ranging from 0.2 nM (2 fmol in 10 µl reaction) to 5 nM (50 fmol in 10 µl reaction) was reacted with 0.5 or 2 pmol of GAO, for 2 min, and the reaction products were analysed. For all the samples, we observed only CIS reaction product peaks, demonstrating that the CIS reaction could be carried out efficiently under a wide range of DNA concentrations (Fig. 8). CIS-reactions conducted under different substrate DNA concentrations. (a) FAM70 DNA and FAM70 DNA subjected for G-tailing (G450%G546%G64%) used as a substrate in panels (b) and (c).

DiscussionIn this study, upon our finding of tailing enhancers,10 we optimized the CIS reaction, which has been reported but could not be conducted at a high efficiency. By applying the best set of conditions, adaptor DNA sequence could be appended to the double-stranded blunt DNA end at efficiency close to 100% that no other DNA-handling techniques have achieved.4.1. Accompanying peaksWhen the CIS reaction products were subjected to treatment with T4 DNA polymerase, one major peak was associated with the peaks of products that were a few nucleotides shorter or one nucleotide longer (Fig. 7). The shorter peaks might represent insufficient extension by T4 DNA polymerase. To support this idea, although at a lower level, 3' recessed ends were observed for the product of the PCR reaction using KOD DNA polymerase, which is supposed to generate blunt ends (see the size control in Fig. 1a). The other possibility is the ‘erosion’ of the GAO 3' end during storage (we stored GAOs at 4°C in TE buffer). To assess this possibility, after long-term storage at 4°C for 6 months, some, although significant, fractions of the GAO were found to have undergone erosion of a few nucleotides, which was determined by measuring the mass spectra of the stored oligonucleotides (data not shown). Another possibility is that a proportion of the GAO was not synthesized as its full length. In contrast, the longer product might be the result of the gapped-annealing of GAO that increased the size of the product by the length of the gap. Although the gaps between GAO and dsDNA have been shown to decrease the reaction efficiency considerably,4 extended G-tail of c.a. four nucleotides long might stabilize the gapped annealing.4.2. Importance of tailing enhancersIn our previous study, we identified enhancers for C-, G-, and T-tailing reactions.10 The results of this study clearly showed that the length of the tail is important for the efficiency of the CIS reaction (Fig. 3). Because MMLV-RT can append up to four dAMPs as a tail even in the absence of an enhancer,9 when the G-tail length of the target DNA is short and CIS reaction was started in the presence of dNTPs, MMLV-RT can append the G-tail with a few additional deoxyadenosine monophosphates, resulting in a mosaic tail that is not complementary, and hence not reactive to the GAO that carry Cs at it 3' end. In this regard, the addition of four or more Gs is desirable because no additional A would be further appended to such a long G-tail. In addition, the removal of enhancers as well as Mn2+ ions, which are also enhancers,8,9,13 after the tailing reaction is important for a successful CIS reaction.The removal of enhancers also seems to be important for preventing concatemer formation. Concatemer formation was noted in the experiment shown in Fig. 2c but not in that shown in Fig. 5, and this difference might have resulted from the different methods used to purify DNA after the tailing reaction (phenol/chloroform/isoamylalcohol extraction and ethanol precipitation in Fig. 2 and a DNA purification column in Fig. 5).4.3. Use of a GAO with 3' ribonucleotidesIn this study, we showed that even with a long tail of Gs up to four nucleotides long, a GAO carrying 3' ribonucleotides reacted more efficiently than a GAO carrying the deoxyribonucleotidyl counterpart. However, in practical use, the advantage of a ribonucleotidyl GAO seems to be limited, especially when extensively G-tailed DNA is subjected to the CIS reaction. In Fig. 4a, substrates G-tailed in the absence of enhancer (mostly +G2) was used, and the rG-carrying GAO exhibited only ~5% higher efficiency when compared with GAO that carry dG. In addition, 98% of reaction yield can be achieved even when deoxyribonucleotidyl GAOs are used when extensively G-taild DNA (mostly +G4) was a substrate (Fig. 7). The chemical instability as well as the increased cost for ribonucleotidyl GAO preparation also supports the use of deoxyribonucleotidyl GAO.From a mechanistic point of view, the 3' ribonucleotides of the GAO appear to not only increase the thermostability with the deoxyribonucleotidyl tail but also stably interact with MMLV-RT, thereby increasing the efficiency. This idea is consistent with the fact that the physiological substrate of MMLV-RT is not DNA but RNA.4.4. Effect of the GAO sequence on CIS reaction efficiencyWe used two types of GAOs: one represents the adaptor sequence of the Illumina sequencer (used here except in Fig. 4)6 and the other represents single-stranded DNAs as used by Chenchik et al.6 (used in Fig. 4; SA670-SA673). Not only the 3' end of the GAO but also the entire nucleotide sequence affect the CIS reaction efficiency (for example, compare the SA673 data in Fig. 4b and the SA574 data in Fig. 3a). The structure that each GAO can have, e.g. dimers formed between two GAO molecules at the reaction temperature, may affect the efficiency. We also observed a low CIS reaction efficiency with a GAO with six Gs at its 3' end, although the reason for this was unclear (data not shown). Keeping these observations in mind, each GAO to be incorporated should be examined prior to practical use in a system like the one we used in this study.4.5. Use of a biotin-labelled GAO and streptavidin to prevent concatenationConcatemer formation on the cDNA ends of template-switching oligonucleotides has been demonstrated and proposed as a reason for the high background and low cDNA yield, especially when a small amount of RNA is used for cDNA synthesis.8 In their study, Kapteyn et al. demonstrated the usefulness of nucleotide isomers that form non-standard base pairs to reduce concatemer formation. Our findings indicated that more common 5' end modifications on the GAO, e.g. biotinylation, prevented concatenation and that combining with streptavidin further prevented additional tailing (Fig. 5), suggesting that steric hindrance is sufficient to prevent concatenation.4.6. CIS reaction efficiencyWhen we analysed the CIS reaction products, we often observed no peaks representing the initial DNA targets (see Fig. 1a for an example). However, after T4 DNA polymerase treatment, a small but distinct peak with the size of the untailed DNA substrate was always observed. This peak indicated that some fractions of MMLV-RT failed to complete the synthesis of the strand complementary to the GAO, leaving an extended tail resulting from the incomplete synthesis that was removed by T4 DNA polymerase. This failure might have been because the dGTP solution used for tailing was not 100% pure, resulting in a base-mismatch between the tail and 3' end of the GAO. In support of this conjecture, RT’s high error rate has been suggested to be due to its efficiency at extending mismatches.14,15Nonetheless, CIS reaction efficiency is very high and might replace the traditional single-A-tailing followed by adaptor DNA ligation by DNA ligase, for which efficiencies were analysed by droplet digital PCR assays and reported to be 3–20%.165. ConclusionsAdaptor ligation to DNA ends is used as a fundamental DNA technique in library preparations for PacBio,17 Illumina,18 and NanoPore19 sequencing technologies for various research objectives such as de novo genome sequencing, re-sequencing for mutation mapping, and transposon mutant library analysis.20 Our method termed the CIS reaction is advantageous over existing methods in that the CIS reaction can label each DNA at a high efficiency, thereby facilitating analyses for which only limited amount of DNA is available. In addition, when using the CIS reaction with a GAO carrying a random sequence, it is easy to label each DNA fragment with a unique molecular identifier21–23 before the PCR-amplification step, thereby enabling the quantitative processing of NGS reads.We are grateful to Shouta Nonoyama for experimental support.

Inactive PipX interacts with PII and stabilizes the active form of NtcA when 2-oxoglutarate levels increase as a consequence of nitrogen starvation.9 The homologue of pipX, encoded by PMM0393, completes the set of nitrogen regulatory proteins in Prochlorococcus MED4, though it’s functional homology awaits experimental verification. The existence of a complex protein-based interaction network of nitrogen regulation in Prochlorococcus is in striking contrast to the general reduction in the number of regulatory proteins in this genus that is thought to have occurred by an intense genome streamlining process. For instance, only four two-component regulatory systems exist in MED4, compared to 44 in the cyanobacterial model Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.8 However, the reduction in the relative number of regulatory proteins in Prochlorococcus MED4 appears to be offset by a relatively high number of sRNAs, which require much less coding capacity and might serve as versatile post-transcriptional regulators of gene expression.10Cyanobacterial functional RNA (Yfr)2 is an abundant sRNA discovered in picocyanobacteria 13 yrs ago.11 In most cyanobacteria, small gene families with slightly divergent copies exist12 but their functions and possible targets remained enigmatic. In Prochlorococcus MED4, four yfr2 copies were identified, yfr2, yfr3, yfr4, and yfr5, while in the low-light (LL) adapted Prochlorococcus strain MIT9313 only two copies exist.11 In contrast, nine copies were reported for Synechococcus CC9311.12 Though it seems as if Prochlorococcus reduced the number of protein regulators relative to the number of sRNAs,10 there is still the need to regulate the expression of these sRNAs. The genome-wide identification of transcriptional start sites at single-nucleotide resolution13 enables the systematic study of promoter regions and the search for possible regulatory elements. Here, we identified the conserved motif we call CGRE1 (cyanobacterial GntR family transcriptional regulator responsive element 1). It is found in the promoter regions of several, but not all, yfr2 homologs in Prochlorococcus and marine Synechococcus. We used DNA affinity pull-down chromatography to identify the binding of the GntR-like transcriptional regulator PMM1637 to CGRE1 and confirmed this further by in vitro and in vivo assays. Our results suggest that the induction of the Prochlorococcus MED4 homologs Yfr2 and Yfr4 during high light stress and nitrogen starvation is mediated by PMM1637.2.Materials and methods2.1.Culture growth conditions, RNA isolation, and Northern blot analysisProchlorococcus MED4 cultures were grown at 22°C in AMP1 medium14 under 30 µmol quanta m-2 s-1 of continuous white cool light to cell densities of 1–3 × 108 cells per ml. For HL stress experiments, triplicate 1 l cultures were shifted to 300 µmol quanta m-2 s-1 of continuous white cool light. For every collection time point (immediately before the shift to HL, T0, and 15 min, 30 min, 1 h, 3 h, 6 h, 12 h, and 24 h after shift to HL) a 100 ml sample was withdrawn and collected by filtration onto 0.45 µm Supor-450 membranes (Pall). Filters were immersed in PGTX,15 snap frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until further processing. Total RNA was extracted as described.16 For nitrogen starvation experiments, triplicate 1 l cultures were grown to a cell density of 3 × 108 cells ml-1 and the T0 time point was collected. Cells were washed twice in nitrogen-free AMP1 medium by centrifugation for 10 min at 15,000g at 20°C and the cell pellet was resuspended in the same medium. Cultures were grown in nitrogen-depleted AMP1 medium and samples were collected as described above at 3, 6, 12, 24, 48, and 72 h. Northern blot analyses were performed as described,17 and primers #82–87 (Supplementary Table S1) were used for preparing probe templates. Cellular transcript abundance was determined as previously described.182.2.DNA-protein affinity chromatographyProtein pull-down assays using the yfr2 promoter or <U+0394>yfr2 promoter (yfr2 promoter with randomly shuffled CGRE1 motif) were essentially performed as previously described.19 In brief, 8 l cultures of Prochlorococcus MED4 cultures were pelleted by centrifugation at 15,000g for 10 min at 20°C and washed twice with nitrogen-free medium. After 24 h of cultivation in nitrogen-free AMP1 medium, cells were harvested by centrifugation at 15,000g for 10 min at 20°C and washed with buffer 1 (1.3 M glycine betaine, 10 mM HEPES pH 8). The cell pellet was resuspended in 4 ml BS/THES buffer (22 mM Tris–HCl, 4.4 mM EDTA, 8.9% sucrose (m/v), 62 mM NaCl, 10 mM HEPES, 5 mM CaCl2, 50 mM KCl, 12% glycerol, pH 7.5).19 BS/THES buffer was supplemented with proteinase inhibitor (cOmplete proteinase inhibitor cocktail, Roche), 0.5 mM MgCl2, 50 µM ZnSO4, 50 µM FeCl2, 50 µM MnCl2, and 50 µM EDTA. Cell lysis was achieved with the One Shot constant cell disruption system (Constant Systems Limited) at 1.4 kbar with one repetition. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000g for 30 min at 4°C. The supernatant was incubated with 200 µl of uncharged Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin (ThermoFisher Scientific) for 20 min to minimize the non-specific binding of contaminants to the beads before incubating with beads loaded with the bait yfr2 promoter or <U+0394>yfr2 promoter for 1 h at room temperature. Before incubating with lysate, Dynabeads were washed and prepared as described by the manufacturer. Yfr2 and <U+0394>yfr2 promoters were amplified by PCR using primers #1 and #2 or #3, respectively, with KAPA-HiFi polymerase (Kapa Biosystems). For the biotinylated primer, a limiting amount of 0.2 µM was applied and the PCR products were loaded on Dynabeads in 1× BW Buffer (5 mM Tris–HCl pH 7.5, 0.5 mM EDTA, and 1 M NaCl). After incubating with cell lysate, beads charged with bait promoters and bound proteins were washed with BS/THES buffer and proteins were eluted with elution buffer (25 mM Tris–HCl, 100/250/500/750/2000 mM NaCl). Protein elution fractions were precipitated overnight at 4°C by adding trichloroacetic acid to a final concentration of 15%. Proteins were pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000g for 30 min at 4°C. Protein pellets were washed with 50% cold acetone, resuspended in water and supplemented with protein loading buffer. Samples were denatured at 95°C for five min and treated with 10 mM iodoacetamide at room temperature in the dark for 30 min. Elution fractions were analysed on RunBlue SDS Protein Gels 4–20% (Expedeon) in a Tris-Tricine running buffer system. Gels were stained with InstantBlue (Expedeon). Proteins specific for the yfr2 promoter elution fraction were analysed by mass spectrometry (Core Facility Proteomics, ZBSA, University of Freiburg).2.3.Generation of expression vectorsThe gene PMM1637 was amplified from genomic DNA with primers #13 and #14 (Supplementary Table S1), digested with SphI and BamHI and introduced into the expression vector pQE-70. Primers #20–67 (Supplementary Table S1) were used to generate point mutation variants of PMM1637 using the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (NEB) or AQUA cloning.20 The construct pQE-70_PMM1637 encoding the wild-type protein served as a template for codon optimization of the first 59 and last 75 amino acids using Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (NEB) and primers #15–19 (Supplementary Table S1). The PMM1637_R50A mutant was derived from the codon-optimized construct pQE_PMM1637 by PCR using primers #16 and #19 (Supplementary Table S1) and transformed into E. coli Top10 F’ using AQUA cloning.20 For recombinant protein expression, the constructs pQE_PMM1637 and PMM1637_R50A were transformed into E. coli M15.The backbone pXG10SF21 was amplified using primers #72 and #73 (Supplementary Table S1). Wild-type and mutant yfr2 promoters were generated by annealing phosphorylated complementary primers #68 and #69 or #70 and #71 (Supplementary Table S1) followed by ligation of annealed primers into the pXG10SF backbone. The resulting vectors were templates for PCR amplification of vectors containing yfr3, yfr4, yfr5, or PMM1637 promoter regions (for primers see Supplementary Table S1 #74–81). Plasmids containing promoter regions of yfr3, yfr4, yfr5, or PMM1637 were generated using the Q5 Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (NEB) or by AQUA cloning.202.4.E. coli GFP in vivo assaypXG10SF vectors containing yfr2, yfr3, yfr4, yfr5, and yfr2 mutant or PMM1637 promoter constructs were co-transformed with either pQE_PMM1637 or pQE_PMM1637_R50A into E. coli TOP10. Colonies were inoculated into 200 µl of lysogeny broth medium supplemented with chloramphenicol and ampicillin in a 96-well plate and incubated overnight at 37°C with gentle agitation at 150 rpm in an air humidity-saturated environment to prevent evaporation. Cells were diluted 1: 10, fixed with 1% Roti Histofix (Roth) and analysed on an Accuri C6 flow cytometer (Beckman-Coulter) monitoring GFP fluorescence at an excitation wavelength of 488 nm and emission wavelength at 533/30 nm. The mean fluorescence per plasmid combination was calculated from 50,000 events (cells) of six individual clones. Fold changes were calculated by dividing the average of the mean fluorescence from six clones for the respective combinations. For the verification of promoter functionality, 5' RACE experiments were performed as described.10 Western blot analysis for the detection of GFP was performed with anti-GFP antibody (Sigma) according to the manufacturer’s description. Western blot membranes were stained with Pierce Reversible Protein Stain Kit (Thermo Scientific) according to the manufacturer’s description. PMM1637 WT and PMM1637 R50A recombinant proteins were detected with anti-Penta-His antibody conjugated to horseradish peroxidase (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s description.2.5.Recombinant protein expression and purificationThe codon-optimized vectors pQE_PMM1637 and pQE_PMM1637_R50A were transformed in E. coli M15 for overexpression of recombinant proteins PMM1637 and PMM1637_R50A. Overnight cultures were diluted 1: 100 in fresh terrific broth medium supplemented with ampicillin and kanamycin, and grown to OD600 0.5. Protein expression was induced by adding isopropyl-ß-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG, 2 mM final concentration) and cells were harvested by centrifugation at 6,000g for 10 min at 4°C 5 h after induction. Cell pellets were resuspended in lysis buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4 pH 8, 1 M NaCl, 10% glycerol, 0.5% Tween20, 7.5 mM imidazole, complete proteinase inhibitor cocktail, Roche) and lysed using the One Shot constant cell disruption system (Constant Systems Limited, United Kingdom) at 2.4 kbar in two consecutive cycles. Cell debris was pelleted by centrifugation at 13,000g for 30 min at 4°C and the lysate was filtered through 0.45 µm Supor-450 filters (Pall). Recombinant proteins were immobilized on a HiTrap Talon crude column (GE Healthcare) and eluted with elution buffer (50 mM NaH2PO4 pH 7,400 mM imidazole, 100 mM NaCl). Elution fractions were combined and supplemented with 5 mM dithiothreitol (DTT). Combined immobilized metal ion chromatography elution fractions were loaded on HiTrap SP HP columns equilibrated with buffer A (50 mM NaH2PO4 pH 7.6, 25 mM NaCl). The column was washed with 17.5% buffer B (50 mM NaH2PO4 pH 7.2, 1 M NaCl) and protein was eluted with 33% buffer B. Elution factions were again supplemented with 5 mM DTT, and the buffer was changed to TBS including 5 mM DTT using Amicon Ultra Centrifugal Filters 10 K (Merck). Protein concentration was calculated by measuring the absorption at 280 nm.2.6.Electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA)Cy3 end-labelled probes for EMSA were generated using primers #4–12 (Supplementary Table S1). Reaction conditions for binding protein to DNA were 12 mM HEPES, 15.7 mM Tris, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM EGTA, 40.16% glycerol, 1 µg LightShift Poly (dIdC) (Thermo Fischer Scientific), 60 mM KCl, 64.2 mM NaCl, and 15.625 nM DNA probe. The concentration of proteins used for shift experiments were 595.4, 426.5, 297.3, 193.4, and 128.4 nM. Samples were run on 1.5% agarose gels in 0.5 × TAE.3.ResultsThe degree of conservation and wide distribution of the yfr2 family within the cyanobacterial phylum prompted us to determine whether the regulation of yfr2 itself is conserved. Bioinformatic analysis led to the identification of a highly conserved sequence starting 55–57 nucleotides upstream of the yfr2 transcriptional start site, which is present in Prochlorococcus and marine Synechococcus. The highly conserved motif was further analysed by multiple sequence alignments of yfr2 promoters (Supplementary Fig. S1) utilizing primary transcriptome data for the strains MED4 and MIT9131313 or inferring the first transcribed nucleotide based on sequence comparison.12 The highly conserved motif is 22 nucleotides long in HL Prochlorococcus strains (Fig. 1B); however, in LL-adapted Prochlorococcus and marine Synechococcus strains, it is one nucleotide shorter (Fig. 1A). The promoter sequence of yfr2c in Prochlorococcus SS120 contains a completely conserved inverted repeat (Supplementary Fig. S1). In the yfr2a promoter of Prochlorococcus MIT9313, the start of the conserved motif is not found at the usual -55 to -57 position, but at -20. In Prochlorococcus MED4, the highly conserved motif shows the highest conservation in the yfr2 and yfr4 promoters, while it is entirely degenerated in the yfr3 promoter (Supplementary Fig. S1A). One half of the motif is highly conserved in the yfr5 promoter, while the other half is disrupted by the terminator of the upstream yfr18 gene. Yfr3 is also the least abundant yfr2 homolog in Prochlorococcus MED4 (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S2) indicating that the disrupted motif in yfr5 might still be sufficient for some transcription.

Logos were created based on sequences of the sequence alignment in Supplementary Figure S1 using the sequence logo generator WebLogo.31To identify possible binding proteins of the highly conserved motif, we utilized DNA affinity pull-down.19 As bait we used a 155 nt Prochlorococcus MED4 yfr2 promoter fragment and a mutated version (<U+0394>yfr2) with a randomly shuffled motif (Fig. 2B). Captured proteins were analysed by SDS-PAGE and subsequently by mass spectrometry. A protein band at approximately 45 kDa was present in the 500 mM NaCl elution fraction of the yfr2 promoter bait that was not visible in any of the other elution fractions loaded onto the gel (Supplementary Fig. S3). Among the proteins that were identified by mass spectrometry from a gel slice of the specific protein band was PMM1637, which was enriched 28-fold compared to the gel sample of the equivalent area of the <U+0394>yfr2 promoter 500 mM NaCl elution fraction (Supplementary Table S3). PMM1637 is a 323 amino acid protein that is annotated as a possible transcriptional regulator. Indeed, searches against the pfam, STRING and EggNOG databases showed an N-terminal Winged helix-turn-helix (WHTH) DNA-binding domain, characteristic of the GntR family of transcriptional regulators. Hence, we considered PMM1637 as a promising candidate for a transcription factor governing Yfr2 transcription via binding to the highly conserved motif. We named the palindromic sequence CGRE1 for cyanobacterial GntR family transcriptional regulator responsive element 1. DNA-binding properties of purified recombinant PMM1637 protein. (A) PMM1637 DNA binding was tested by EMSA assays using Cy3-labelled yfr2, <U+0394>yfr2, yfr3, yfr4, yfr5 and PMM1637 promoter fragments. Binding reactions contained 128.4, 193.4, 297.3, 426.5, or 595.4 nM recombinant PMM1637 or PMM1637 R50A protein in the presence of 15.625 nM labelled promoter fragment and 1 µg poly (dI–dC) as a non-specific competitor. (B) Sequences found in the respective promoter regions starting 55–57 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. Nucleotides that are in agreement with the consensus sequence are underlined.DNA-binding properties of purified recombinant PMM1637 protein.

(B) Sequences found in the respective promoter regions starting 55–57 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site. Nucleotides that are in agreement with the consensus sequence are underlined.Next, we purified the recombinant PMM1637 wild-type protein (PMM1637 WT from here on), overexpressed in E. coli, by immobilized metal ion chromatography followed by ion exchange chromatography (Supplementary Fig. S4) and performed electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA). Promoters of yfr2 and yfr4 were shifted whereas yfr3 and yfr5 promoters were not (Fig. 2A). This result correlates with the presence of CGRE1 in the yfr2 and yfr4 promoter regions and the degeneration and partial loss in yfr3 and yfr5 promoter regions, respectively. Furthermore, PMM1637 WT did not bind to its own promoter, indicating that it does not autoregulate its own expression. For verification, we mutated an ultraconserved arginine residue at position 50 to alanine in PMM1637 (PMM1637 R50A from here on) (Supplementary Fig. S5A). According to the NCBI conserved domains database, residue R50 is involved in nucleic acid binding in the GntR transcriptional regulator family.22 R50 is located within the WHTH DNA-binding domain (accession number cd07377) of PMM1637 spanning amino acids 12–77. EMSA analysis showed that the PMM1637 R50A mutant was not able to shift the yfr2 or yfr4 promoter (Fig. 2A), hence, confirming that the DNA binding ability of the PMM1637 R50A mutant was greatly reduced.There is no genetic system for Prochlorococcus. Therefore, we modified the heterologous GFP reporter system that is otherwise used to identify sRNA-mRNA interactions21 to further analyse the influence of PMM1637 on yfr2 promoters. We co-expressed the PMM1637 WT or PMM1637 R50A protein encoded on the pQE-70 plasmid with the pXG10-SF plasmid that contains a 5' UTR conferring high expression of GFP in combination with various promoters (Fig. 3A). The results confirmed that all promoters were recognized in E. coli and consequently, GFP was produced (Supplementary Fig. S6A). We can exclude the possibility of erroneous promoter usage, as 5' RACE experiments showed transcription initiation from the correct start point or in close proximity (Supplementary Figs S7 and S8). Expression from the yfr2 or yfr4 promoter was higher in the presence of PM1637 WT in comparison to PMM1637 R50A, while the expression from the <U+0394>yfr2, yfr3, yfr5, and PMM1637 promoters, as well as the native pXG10-SF promoter PLtetO was not altered regardless of the co-expressed protein (Fig. 3B). We can exclude that differences in GFP fluorescence intensities are caused by unequal protein expression levels of PMM1637 WT and PMM1637 R50A (Supplementary Fig. S6B and C). The positive influence of PMM1637 WT on the yfr2 promoter is also supported by the fact that the transcriptional regulator PMM0637 (Fur), which is not related to Yfr2 expression, showed the same level of expression as the inactive PMM1637 R50A (Fig. 3A–C). All findings are in agreement with the in silico analysis and in vitro experiments described above. Transcription factors of the GntR family contain the small DNA-binding WHTH domain at their N-terminus and a very diverse regulatory ligand-binding domain within the C-terminal half,23 which provides the basis for the subfamily classification. Because there is no information about the regulatory domain of PMM1637, we used this GFP system to further elucidate the function of several other highly conserved residues in the C-terminal effector domain (Supplementary Fig. S5B and C). Based on sequence conservation among 20 PMM1637 homologs (Supplementary Fig. S5A), highly conserved amino acids with putative reactive groups such as carboxy-, guanidine-, or amine groups were chosen for point mutations. Among the 24 investigated mutants, five others (D141A, T182A, R200A, R236A, and D276A) showed a comparable average fold change between the yfr2 and <U+0394>yfr2 promoter as PMM1637 R50A did (Supplementary Fig. S5C), suggesting that all these six amino acids are important for protein activity. The mutants K217M and S231A showed a slightly higher average fold change than the PMM1637 WT (Supplementary Fig. S5C), hence, these substitutions might possibly have locked the protein into an active conformation.

(C) Fold change differences between Prochlorococcus MED4 yfr2 and <U+0394>yfr2 promoter in the presence of either PMM1637 WT, PMM1637 R50A, or PMM0637 (Fur) were calculated from results shown in A).Previous studies on PMM1637 homologs in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 and Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942 suggested that this transcription factor is involved in regulation during HL adaptation and nitrogen starvation, respectively.24–26 We, therefore, monitored Prochlorococcus MED4 Yfr2, Yfr3, Yfr4, and Yfr5 expression during these conditions. Nitrogen depletion caused the strongest induction of gene expression for the Yfr2 and Yfr4 homolog, increasing from approximately 100 to 1,000 copies per cell after 48 h and from 20 to 144 copies per cell after 72 h of nitrogen starvation, respectively (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Table S2). The response and accumulation pattern observed here was delayed in comparison to the induction of ntcA transcript accumulation that we used as an indicator of nitrogen stress (Fig. 4C). Whereas ntcA was already strongly induced after 3 h of nitrogen depletion, Yfr2 reached its maximum only 48 h and Yfr4 only 72 h after nitrogen depletion (Fig. 4A and C). Shifting Prochlorococcus MED4 cells from 30 to 300 µE resulted in a rapid increase of Yfr2 and Yfr4 transcript accumulation already visible after 15 min of HL exposure (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Table S2). The expression of Yfr2 began to decline after 30–45 min of HL exposure, while the induced expression of Yfr4 plateaued and only dropped down to standard levels after 24 h of HL treatment (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Table S2). Compared to nitrogen depletion, the response of ntcA to HL stress was remarkably weaker. During the course of HL exposure only a slight increase in ntcA transcript was visible, which might indicate the first signs of an imbalanced C/N ratio in the cell (Fig. 4D).

CGRE1 motifs observed in HL- and LL-adapted ecotypes differ in length and nucleotide composition. The LL motif is flanked by ‘GTTG’ and the HL motif by ‘GTTA’ (Supplementary Fig. S1). The G to A transition is consistent with the low GC content in HL Prochlorococcus. The identified CGRE1 motif recognized by PMM1637 contains sequence elements that have been described before for other motifs of GntR family transcriptional regulators. The flanking ‘GTTG’ of the LL type and the ‘GTTA’ of the HL type resemble parts of what has been found for CceR from Rhodobacter sphaeroides.27 However, unlike in CGRE1 described here, the sequence and its inverted repeat are separated by only four nucleotides instead of 13–14. In the same study, EMSA assays showed that the T positions are crucial for binding.27 AkgR from Rhodobacter sphaeroides binds to the direct repeat of ‘GTGATCAC’ separated by 13 nucleotides.27 We find almost the same sequence in the middle of CGRE1 except that ‘AT’ in the center is inverted in the HL CGRE1 and one position is deleted in the LL CGRE1. There is also no repetition of ‘GTGATCAC’ in yfr2 promoters within a distance of 13 nucleotides.PMM1637 has a homolog in all cyanobacterial genomes. The first functional characterization of a cyanobacterial GntR family transcription regulator was provided by Lee et al., who found evidence that in Anabaena sp. PCC 7120 the homolog acts as a plasmid maintenance factor and therefore called it PlmA.28 The same study defined a new subfamily of GntR family transcriptional regulators based on the divergence in the C-terminal effector domain that includes PMM1637 (formerly annotated as Pmar1604) and PlmA.28 In a recent yeast three-hybrid screening of genomic libraries from Synechococcus elongatus PCC7942, PlmA was found to bind to the complex of PII-PipX.25 This interaction seems to be facilitated by PII-bound PipX and occurs only during low levels of the nitrogen status reporter molecule 2-oxoglutarate.25 However, the activation of PMM1637 does not appear to directly depend on 2-oxoglutarate because the accumulation kinetics of its targets Yfr2 and Yfr4 differ from that of ntcA, which is activated at high 2-oxoglutarate concentrations.27 Accumulation of Yfr2 and Yfr4 during early HL adaptation and virtually no changes in ntcA gene expression emphasize that 2-oxoglutarate is not involved in PMM1637-dependent regulation. It is therefore likely that PMM1637 is regulated by another cofactor that signals during late nitrogen depletion stress and early HL adaptation, possibly connecting C- and N-regulatory circuits. In Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, the PlmA homolog Sll1961 is involved in phycobilisome degradation during nitrogen starvation.26 The disruption of sll1961 leads to a non-bleaching phenotype of the sll1961 mutant, despite elevated levels of the phycobilisome degradation protein NblA during nitrogen starvation.26 Another study showed that the sll1961 mutant strain retained a constant PSII/PSI ratio throughout all tested light conditions while the wild-type ratio increased during acclimation to high light,24 which could be explained by a weaker decline in the number of PSI reaction center subunits PsaA and PsaB in the mutant compared to the wild-type.24 The regulation of PsaAB seems to occur at the translational or posttranslational level because the decrease in psaAB mRNA accumulation was comparable in wild-type and mutant.24 In Prochlorococcus the inverse relationship in the levels of Yfr2 and psaAB mRNA under high light16 and nitrogen starvation29 suggests that the psaAB mRNA might be a target of Yfr2. The latter reports are consistent with our findings of increased Yfr2 levels during nitrogen starvation and HL stress, though the functional orthology between the GntR-like factors of different cyanobacteria certainly requires more detailed investigation.Pairs of transcription factors and sRNAs are building blocks in the regulatory network, including the response to nitrogen starvation in cyanobacteria, as exemplified by the NtcA-NsiR4 regulatory system in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.30 However, the architecture of the regulatory machinery mediating this response was postulated to differ in marine picocyanobacteria. While NtcA is also conserved in Prochlorococcus, NsiR4 is not, which exemplarily shows that stress-related sRNAs are mostly restricted to certain groups within cyanobacteria but protein regulators are not, depending on the function. In contrast, the GntR family transcriptional regulator, as well as the yfr2 family, are globally distributed among cyanobacteria. However, CGRE1 appears to be restricted to marine Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus. Therefore, regulation of Yfr2 by PMM1637 could be a result of the streamlined regulatory network that is found within the picocyanobacteria. Thus, this finding provides another example how widely conserved genes are differentially used in closely related taxa. Future studies will certainly help to answer the question of whether the homologs of PMM1637 also regulate members of the Yfr2 family in other cyanobacteria or if the targets of Yfr2 in Prochlorococcus are elsewhere regulated by the PMM1637 homolog. A study on the global response of gene expression during nitrogen starvation in Prochlorococcus MED4 identified the differential gene expression of 16% of the entire genome.29 However, only a small subset of these genes possesses an NtcA binding site and therefore, many must be controlled by other factors such as PMM1637 and Yfr2. The occurrence of at least two nitrogen stress-related regulons in marine picocyanobacteria might be connected to their nitrogen-poor habitat, leading to the requirement of more regulatory circuits for a fine-tuned acclimation. The results of previous studies and of this work underline the importance of the cyanobacterial GntR family in the regulation of gene expression during nitrogen starvation and hint to an important role of this transcription factor family in maintaining the homeostasis of nitrogen and carbon metabolism. The future identification of targets of the Yfr2-PMM1637 regulon will shed light on their functional role in this complex network and may uncover hidden layers of bacterial gene regulation.We thank Wolfgang R.

IntroductionCoenurosis is an often fatal central nervous system (CNS) parasitic disease mainly in sheep and other ungulates, this frequently leads to their death and huge socioeconomic losses, especially in developing countries. This parasite disease is caused by the larval stage (Coenurus cerebralis) of the tapeworm Taenia multiceps1 (Phylum Platyhelminthes). The parasite can also cause zoonotic infections in humans, but has been largely neglected due to a lack of diagnostic techniques and studies.2 Two hosts are required to complete its life cycle. The adult tapeworm inhabits the small intestine of the definitive host (dog, wolf and fox), while the larval coenurus stage parasitizes the brain or spinal cord of the intermediate host (sheep, goat and cattle),3 causing a disease called ‘staggers’ or ‘gid’ resulting in pronounced intracranial pressure, leading to headache, ataxia, hypermetria, head deviation, blindness, stumbling, paralysis and even death.4–6 Coenurosis has spread across most regions of the world, especially in developing countries in Africa and southeast Asia that are involved in the husbandry of sheep or goats, resulting in serious economic losses.7 Notably, coenurosis is also a zoonosis which can lead to serious pathological conditions in humans, and appears to be more common than previously assumed.8T. multiceps has evolved several strategies to adapt to a parasitic life style including the loss of respiratory organs and a digestive tract so that andnutrients are absorbed through its unique external tegument.9 It is monoecious, producing diploid eggs by self-fertilization which give rise to infective oncospheres.10 Further, the germinative neck region of the adult worm of T. multiceps can produce hundreds of proglottids (segments), each of which has a set of complete reproductive organs and contains tens of thousands of oncospheres (eggs) after maturation.9 In addition, one oncosphere can develop into a cysticercus which possesses unusual powers of asexual multiplication, forming a bladder or coenurus which can give rise to hundreds of daughter protoscoleces, each of which has the potential to grow into an adult worm, if ingested by a definitive host. The characteristics of nutrient absorption and reproduction have contributed to the wide-spread, global distribution of T. multiceps.Though treatment and preventative measures are available, the control of coenurosis is still challenging. Burning or burying infected intermediate host offal is the most simple and effective way to block the transmission of T. multiceps to canine definitive hosts, but these procedures result in considerable economic loss. Surgery after general anaesthesia of an infected animal has been used for the removal of the coenurus cyst,11,12 but the procedure is limited under field conditions due to economic constraints. Antiparasitic drugs, such as a combination of fenbendazole, praziquantel and albendazole, are effective against the migrating larvae and represent a more practicable method for expelling T. multiceps, but they are often associated with side effects in the host. Development of an effective vaccine can complement interventions for the prevention of coenurosis, and in recent years, the recombinant proteins, Tm16 and Tm18, have been developed as vaccine candidates, having been shown to provide some protection in sheep against experimental infection with T. multiceps eggs.13,14 However, the vaccine efficacy is comparatively modest compared with other recombinant anti-cestode vaccines that have been developed.15 Therefore, the development of more effective and safe interventions to control coenurosis is still an urgent need.The recent sequencing of tapeworm genomes has facilitated a better understanding of their genetic makeup, providing new insight on the functional biology and mechanisms of pathogenesis in cestodes as well as providing new targets for control tools leading to improved prevention and treatment of cestodiases. To date, several tapeworm genomes, including two Echinococcus species (E. multilocularis and E. granulosus) and three Taenia species (T. solium, T. saginata and T. asiatica) have been sequenced, with assembled genome sizes ranging from 114 to 169 Mb.16–18 However, there is limited genetic information reported for T. multiceps, apart from some limited transcriptome and microRNA data.2,19 Here, we present a high-quality genome assembly for T. multiceps together with transcriptomic information for several of its developmental stages. Our study not only provides insights into the biology and evolution of T. multiceps, but also identifies a set of potentially novel drug and vaccine targets, which we anticipate will contribute to the development of much needed new treatment and control measures for coenurosis.2. Materials and methods2.1. Samples collection and sequencingAdult worms of T. multiceps were collected 68 days after infection from a dog experimentally infected with protoscoleces. The protoscoleces and cyst wall were separated from the brain of a naturally infected sheep around 3 months infection collected in Gansu province, China. According to the Animal Ethics Procedures and Guidelines of the People’s Republic of China, animals used in this study were cared in accordance with good animal practice and the study was permitted by the Institutional Committee for the Care and Use of Experimental Animals of Lanzhou Veterinary Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (no. LVRIAEC 2010-002). Scolex-neck proglottids, immature-mature proglottids and gravid proglottids were obtained by cutting the whole adult worms into three parts based on the tapeworm proglottids characteristics.10 Oncospheres were hatched by 0.75% sodium hypochlorite and activated under artificial intestinal fluid conditions in vitro. Genomic DNA was extracted from a single adult T. multiceps for constructing four Illumina 400-bp insert libraries and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq 2500 platforms. Two PacBio 20-kb insert library were constructed and sequenced on RSII and Sequel, respectively. Total mRNA was extracted from the seven T. multiceps materials (activated oncospheres, protoscolices, cyst wall and adult, scolex-neck proglottids, immature-mature proglottids and gravid proglottids) for constructing cDNA libraries (insert 350-bp) (Supplementary Methods and Results section), and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencer.2.2. Genome assembly and annotationThe Illumina raw reads were filtered by trimming the adapter sequence and low-quality part, resulting in a clean and high-quality reads data with average error rate < 0.001. For the PacBio raw data, the short subreads (<2 kb) and low-quality (error rate > 0.2) subreads were filtered out, and only one representative subread was retained for each PacBio read. The clean PacBio reads were assembled by the software canu (http://canu.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html#), then Illumina reads were aligned to the contigs by Burrows-Wheeler Aligner-MEM (BWA-MEM),20 and single base errors in the contigs were corrected by Pilon (v1.16)21 (Supplementary Methods and Results section).For the Hi-C-based proximity-guided assembly, we removed duplications and kept reads that uniquely mapped to the reference genome. The assembly package, Lachesis was applied to do clustering, ordering and orienting. Based on the agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithm,22 we clustered the scaffolds into 100 N. Then the longest acyclic spanning tree which be called ‘trunk’ was build according to the relations between the normalized HiC interactions and the scaffolds that were excluded from the trunk were sites that maximized the amount of linkage between adjacent scaffolds. For each chromosome cluster, we got an exact scaffold order of the internal groups and traversed all the directions of the scaffolds through a weighted directed acyclic graph to predict orientation for each of the scaffolds.The gene models in T. multiceps genome were predicted by EVidence Modeler v1.1.1,23 integrating evidences from ab initio predictions, homology-based searches and RNA-seq alignments (Supplementary Methods and Results section). Then, the protein-coding sequences were mapped by RNA-seq data and functionally annotated using UniProt24 and InterProScan (5.16-55.0) databases.25 Finally, the gene models were retained if they had at least one supporting evidence from UniProt database, InterProScan domain and RNA-seq data. Gene functional annotation was performed by aligning the protein sequences to NCBI NR, UniProt, eggNOG and KEGG databases using BLASTP v2.3.0+ with E-value cut-off of 10-5. The pathway analysis and functional classification were conducted based on KEGG database.26 InterProScan25 was used to assign preliminary gene ontology (GO) terms, Pfam domains and IPR domains to the gene models.A de novo repeat library for T. multiceps was constructed by RepeatModeler (v1.0.4; http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler.html). transposable elements (TEs) in the T. multiceps genome were also identified by RepeatMasker (v4.0.6; http://www.repeatmasker.org/) using both Repbase library and the de novo library (Supplementary Methods and Results section). Tandem repeats were predicted using Tandem Repeats Finder v4.07b.27 The divergence rates of TEs were calculated between the identified TE elements in the genome and their consensus sequence at the repeat family level.2.3. Evolution analysisDuplicated genomic fragments were identified by MCscanX,28 requiring at least 10 paralogous gene pairs per collinear block, and the duplicate_gene_classifier in MCscanX was implemented to classify the origins of the duplicate genes into different types. Orthologous and paralogous gene families were assigned from 14 species (T. multiceps, T. saginata, T. asiatica, T. solium, E. granulosus, E. multilocularis, Hymenolepis microstoma, Brugia malayi, Caenorhabditis elegans, Clonorchis sinensis, Pristionchus pacificus, Schistosoma mansoni, Fasciola hepatica and Trichinella spiralis) by OrthoFinder29 with default parameters.Gene families that contain only one gene for each species were selected to construct the phylogenetic tree. The protein sequences of each gene family was independently aligned by muscle v3.8.3130 and then concatenated into one super-sequence. The phylogenetic tree was constructed by maximum likelihood (ML) using PhyML v3.031 with best-fit model (MtMAN) that was estimated by ProtTest3.32 The Bayesian-Relaxed Molecular Clock approach was adopted to estimate the neutral evolutionary rate and species divergence time using the programme MCMCTree, implemented in PAML v4.9 package.33 The calibration time (fossil record time) interval (27–29 Mya) of Echinococcus species was adopted from previous results.34Paralogous gene pairs with a length of more than 100 amino acids and E value of 1 e-10 were used to calculate synonymous mutation rate (Ks) by KaKs_Calculator 2.0 with default parameter.35Ks values between two species were calculated using the syntenic gene pairs.The positively selected genes (PSGs) were identified based on the 3,316 one-to-one orthologous gene groups from genomes of the six tapeworms from the results by OrthoFinder.29 Multiple alignments of protein-coding DNA sequence were generated as referenced by the protein alignments using ParaAT (v1.0) and MAFFT (v7.147b). The gaps in the alignment results were removed, and likelihood ratio tests (LRTs) for selection (P < 0.05) on the T. multiceps lineage of the phylogenetic tree were performed using Codeml with a modified branch-site model A (model = 2, N sites = 2) implemented in the PAML package (v4.8).2.4. Identification of potential drug targetsThe enzyme drug targets from US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) were used to identify homologues in T. multiceps based on NR and UniProt databases. Furthermore, the G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) proteins were identified based on Pfam annotation. The transmembrane domain of these GPCR proteins in T. multiceps was re-annotated by Prediction of transmembrane helices and topology of proteins (HMMTOP).36 Then, For the GPCR proteins containing more than two transmembrane domains were selected as potential drug targets.16 On the other hand, the genes of T. multiceps involved in serotonin (5-HT) and acetylcholine (Ach) synaptic metabolic pathway were also selected as potential drug targets.16 Besides, previous report antigens, including antigen B/secreted antigen Ts8B1, EMY162, Tsol15, oncosphere protein, STARP (sporozoite threonine and asparagine-rich protein), cytoplasmic antigen 1, cytoplasmic antigen 1, GP50 and 8 kDa antigen, in other tapeworm species16 were used to align against the proteins in T. multiceps by BLASTP with E-value <1 e-5. Finally, to reduce the side-effect of potential drug target for host, the selected drug target genes were aligned to the host protein sequences, including dog, sheep and human respectively, by BLASTP with E-value < 1 e-5. The species-specific drug target genes were identified based on the BLASTP hit.3. Results3.1. High-quality genome assembly and gene annotationWe generated 31 Gigabase (Gb) PacBio Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequences with an average read length of 9.5 kb and 51 Gb Illumina paired-end sequences with a read length of 250 bp using DNA extracted from a single diploid adult worm of T. multiceps (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S1). The PacBio SMRT sequences were assembled by Canu,37 giving rise to an assembly of 2,050 contigs with a total length of 240 Mb, a N50 length of 756 kb, and a N90 length of 34 kb. The GC content of the genome is 43.7%, which is similar to those of other reported Taeniidae species ranging from 41.9 to 43.2%16–18 (Table 1), but higher than that of H. microstoma (35.9%). Estimated from the k-mer frequency distribution, the genome sizes of sequenced Taenia species, including T. saginata,17,T. asiatica17 and T. multiceps, are all nearly 250 Mb, larger than those of Echinococcus species estimated from 154 to 195 Mb (Table 1 and Fig. 1a; Supplementary Fig. S2). The long continuity information resulting from the PacBio SMRT data indicated that ~96% of the genome has been successfully assembled in T. multiceps, which is much higher than those from the Illumina/454 based assembly of other tapeworm species that range from 60 to 75% (Table 1). Based on Hi-C technology, a total of 217.0 Mb (90.4%) assembled contigs were anchored and oriented to the seven linkage groups (Fig. 1b), with the longest 80.1 and shortest 8.5 Mb, respectively, suggesting that the assembly quality was much better than the published genomes of Taenia sepecies so far (Table 1). Summary of assembly and annotation of tapeworm genomesThe genome data of six other tapeworm species (T. solium, T. saginata, T. asiatica, E. multilocularis, E. granulosus and H. microstoma) were downloaded from WormBase and the NCBI database. The N50 and N90 sizes were calculated based on the assembled genome size.The estimated genome sizes were reported in Wang et al. (2016); For the E. multilocularis and E. granulosus, the estimated genome sizes were used the Illumina reads by distribution of kmer frequency (Supplementary Fig. S2). We did not estimate the genome sizes of T. solium and H. microstoma, because of Illumina reads not be found.Summary of assembly and annotation of tapeworm genomesThe genome data of six other tapeworm species (T. solium, T. saginata, T. asiatica, E. multilocularis, E. granulosus and H. microstoma) were downloaded from WormBase and the NCBI database.

(c) A Venn diagram showing the unique and shared size.The accuracy and completeness of the assembly were evaluated by mapping the Illumina shotgun reads to the assembled reference genome. Significantly, on average 99.8 and 98.2% of the genome-derived and transcriptome-derived reads could be aligned to the reference genome (Supplementary Table S2), respectively, indicating that the majority of the genomic sequence is contained in the current assembly. Furthermore, ~98% of Illumina assembled contigs were mapped to ~50% of the reference genome with 99.2% identity, emphasizing the considerable advantage of using the long-reads assembly (Fig. 1c). Moreover, a total of 13 telomeres were identified located on one end of the contigs with an average size of 10 kb, compared with 12 identified telomeres in E. multilocularis and only 1–3 telomeres in other tapeworm genomes, further supporting the high physical coverage of the current assembly (Supplementary Table S4).The protein-coding genes were predicted on the reference genome by evidence modeler,23 integrating evidence from de novo prediction, transcriptome and homology data. In total, 13,013 gene models were predicted as the reference gene set, with coding regions spanning ~18.5 Mb (7.7%) of the genome (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S5). The distribution of exon number and CDS length in T. multiceps is similar to the closely related E. multilocularis and E. granulosus (Supplementary Fig. S3). 81.8% of eukaryote core genes from OrthoDB (http://www.orthodb.org) were identified as complete in the reference gene set by BUSCO38 (Table 1). For functional annotation, a total of 11,914 (92%) coding proteins were annotated by functional databases (Supplementary Table S6). On the other hand, a total of 521 non-coding RNA genes (379 tRNA and 142 rRNA) were identified in the T. multiceps genome (Supplementary Table S7). Together, these demonstrate that the accuracy of gene annotation we achieved is comparable to or better than the other published tapeworm genomes.16,173.2. Recent expansion of transposable elements in Taenia speciesThe high assembly coverage we obtained enabled a comprehensive analysis of TEs which have multiple roles in driving genome evolution in eukaryotes.39 In total, we identified 28.9 Mb (12.0%) TE sequences in the assembled T. multiceps genome (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table S8). Notably, the most abundant LTR retrotransposons present in T. multiceps are Gypsy elements, accounting for 49.7% of the LTR elements, followed by Copia (12.2%) and ERV1 (3.7%) (Fig. 2b). Furthermore, we used the same strategy to annotate and compare TEs in the published T. saginata, T. asiatica, E. multilocularis and E. granulosus genomes. The total TE content in the Taenia species is almost twice that found in the Echinococcus species, but the overall TE content and classification are similar within the former species (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Table S8).

The results showed that each Taenia species had a peak at ~20% divergence rate, containing approximately half of TE copies. In contrast, the Echinococcus species had a peak at ~36% divergence rate (Fig. 2c and Supplementary Fig. S4).Tandem repeat is another kind of repetitive sequence abundant in the eukaryote genome, which plays an important role in maintaining the genome structure. For the sequenced tapeworms, most of the tandem repeats were not correctly assembled and thus missing from the current reference sequences based on Illumina sequencing. In contrast, in the reference assembly of T. multiceps, we successfully annotated a total of 20.5 Mb (8.5%) tandem repeat sequences (Fig. 2a), ~92% of which locate in the fragmentally assembled gene-free sequences. These assembled tandem repeat sequences provide a valuable resource for studying the structure of centromere, telomere, as well as heterochromatic regions.3.3. Gene expansions mostly derived from small-scale gene duplicationsTo gain insights into an evolutionary perspective for T. multiceps, we built a phylogenetic tree based on 271 high-confidence single copy orthologs of 14 helminth worm species by PhyML40 and estimated divergence time using mcmctree41 (Fig. 3a). The results indicate that T. multiceps diverged from T. saginata and T. asiatica 4–11 million years ago (Mya) (95% CI, and from T. solium 13–20 Mya. Analysis of gene families in the high-confidence gene set and 14 sequenced helminth worm genomes identified 122 T. multiceps-specific gene families (Supplementary Fig. S5). Evolution of the T. multiceps genome. (a) Dated tree for 14 species. The age of each node is indicated by 95% CI. (b) Distribution of different types of gene duplication in tapeworm genomes. WGD means whole genome duplication. (c) Distribution of synonymous mutation rate (Ks) values for paralogous gene pairs in each tapeworm genome. Ks values between T. multiceps and E. multilocularis are calculated using the syntenic ortholog gene pairs.Evolution of the T. multiceps genome. (a) Dated tree for 14 species.

(c) Distribution of synonymous mutation rate (Ks) values for paralogous gene pairs in each tapeworm genome. Ks values between T. multiceps and E. multilocularis are calculated using the syntenic ortholog gene pairs.To investigate the evolutionary dynamics of genome structure, we performed comparative genomic analysis among T. multiceps, T. saginata and E. multilocularis, using proteins as markers to identify syntenic genes by MCScan pipeline with parameter –w 10. In the T. multiceps genome, 42.5% genes were identified synteny relationships with T. saginata; whereas 5.15% genes were identified synteny relationships with E. multilocularis. Scrutiny of the local scale synteny, we found that the ratio of syntenic genes between T. multiceps and T. saginata was ~71, versus 68% between T. multiceps and E. multilocularis, which is reasonable considering their phylogenetic distance (Supplementary Fig. S6).In T. multiceps, there were 6,300 dispersed duplicated genes (48.4% of total genes), which were much more than proximal duplicated genes 1,446 (11.1%) and tandem duplicated genes 1,128 (8.7%). The proportion of dispersed duplicated genes in the T. multiceps was similar to that in the T. saginata and T. asiatica (45.8 and 48.1%, respectively), but was significantly higher than that in the E. multilocularis and E. granulosus (32.2 and 30.9%, respectively; P < 0.001; Fig. 3b), consistent with previously reports for the T. saginata and T. asiatica genomes.17 These results suggest that gene expansions in Taenia species are mostly derived from small-scale gene duplications, instead of whole genome duplication.Using the data obtained for the duplicated genes, we analysed the synonymous mutation rate (Ks) of these paralogous gene pairs. No obvious Ks peaks were observed for any of the five tapeworms, reinforcing our inference of no recent whole genome duplication having occurred. The duplicated genes were likely generated gradually over time with relatively more recent duplication events in the Taenia spp. compared with Echinococcus (Fig. 3c). In total, 3,697 genes with Ks < 0.3 were used to analyse the gene function. Results showed that the Hsp70, fibronectin type III, transcription factor families (T-box, homeobox and zinc finger) were significantly enriched in these duplicated genes of T. multiceps (P < 0.001), and the genes involved in the MAPK signalling pathway (map04010) were significantly enriched (P = 0.0071). These observations indicate that genes underlying environmental adaptability and dosage effect tend to be conserved in the T. multiceps genome.3.4. PSGs imply extended evolutionary pressures in the Taenia lineagePositive selection provides evolutionary innovation during adaptation to a new environment. We evaluated the role of positive selection in the evolution of T. multiceps by branch-site model analysis in PAML33 based on orthologous genes from the Taeniidae tapeworms, and identified 204 PSGs (LRT, false discovery rate < 0.05) (Supplementary Material S1). In fact, we found PSGs of essential genes in many fundamental cellular processes, particularly those containing molecular functions of the DNA replication and repairing-related genes, transcription regulation, translation, and protein kinase (Supplementary Material S1). T. multiceps has a life cycle involving a tissue tropism in the brain of ungulates, which, in terms of nutrient availability, represents a different environment compared with most of the other Taenia tapeworms. Strong positive selection signals were observed in energy-metabolism related genes, such as genes involved in carbohydrate metabolism and uptake, including Glucosidase II beta subunit, glucan (1, 4 alpha), branching enzyme 1 and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotid ubiquinone oxidoreductase sgdh subunit, guanosine diphosphate fucose transporter. Notably, homologous genes probably involved in the speciation of T. asiatica17 were also included in the PSGs of T. multiceps (e.g. carbonic anhydrase, amiloride sensitive cation channel 4A, dynein light chain), suggesting the frequent involvement of these genes in adaptation to a new host or tissue environment during tapeworm evolution.3.5. Expansion and up-regulation of the T-box 6 genes produce more proglottids in strobilizationBoth asexual and sexual reproduction occurs in T. multiceps. Strobilization is a process of asexual reproduction whereby the adult tapeworm buds off new segments from the undifferentiated and germinative neck region, forming a series of proglottids which when mature give rise sexually to ovoid eggs.42 The number of proglottids varies among the different tapeworms, with hundreds of segments produced by Taenia species but with only three to five being produced by in the Echinococcus species.10The T-box family of transcription factors shows broad participation in the development of all metazoans; the subfamily T-box 6 (Tbx6), especially plays a central role in somite polarization in the mouse.43 In this study, the number of T-box transcription factors was shown to be significantly expanded in the Taeniidae, representing on average 31 genes in the 4 Taenia species and 5 genes in the 2 Echinococcus species (P = 1.02 e-4) (Supplementary Table S11). Specifically, there were 31, 23, 20 and 12 Tbx6 genes in T. multiceps, T. asiatica, T. saginata and T. solium, respectively, significantly more than in E. granulosus and in E. multilocularis, (each having only one Tbx6 gene (P < 0.001). Based on a phylogenetic analysis of the Tbx6 genes in the Taeniidae, we found that the genes have been expanded in the ancestors of the Taenia species after their divergence from Echinococcus. Furthermore, the sequences of the Tbx6 genes have been divergent along the T. multiceps lineage which contained different motifs on each clade (Fig. 4a and b). These results imply that the Tbx6 genes might gain rapid functional divergence after gene duplication. On the other hand, to investigate the gene expression pattern of Tbx6, we analysed genes expressed with a cut off fragments per kilobase per million (FPKM) > one in the four samples of three different T. multiceps, life cycle stages (one from oncospheres, two from the coenurus and one from the adult). It was surprising that 24 of 31 Tbx6 genes were expressed in the adult stage, whereas no or very limited expression was apparent in the other stages (Fig. 4c). Overall, the different number of proglottids produced in the Taenia species compared with the Echinococcus species may be as a result of the expansion of the Tbx6 genes in the former group which may play an important role in the strobilization process in adult tapeworms.

Coenurus occupy nutrient and release toxicity to the host CNSCoenurosis, as a parasitic zoonosis, could cause potential health threat to the human beings and serious economic losses in sheep farms.7,8 It is a fatal CNS disease to the intermediate host sheep. The coenurus cyst contains hundreds of protoscolices and can grow to the size of a hen’s egg, caused coenurosis by pressing the brain to induce neural lesion (Fig. 5a). Moreover, the nervous system toxicity related with wastes from metabolic process and neurodegenerative disorder protein of parasite (Fig. 5b), may also occupy an important position in the causation of sheep CNS disease. Effect of the coenurus on the sheep CNS. (a) The diagrammatic map of T. multiceps life cycle. The enlarged photo is a growing coenurus cyst with clusters of protoscoleces.

In this respect, glutamate is not only able to provide metabolic energy but also acts as a neurotransmitter to regulate signal transmissions between the synaptosomes and neurons.44,45 Several members of the SLC1A glutamate transporter family have been reported to be involved in glutamate transmission.46 We identified 7 SLC1A gene family members in T. multiceps, which was considerably more than found present in the five other tapeworms (mean 4.4; median 4; P < 0.05), suggesting an increased glutamate transmission capability. Among the SLC1A genes, SLC1A4 composed a major percentage of 50%, which showed a specific expression in different stages (Supplementary Material S2). It is noteworthy that three members of SLC1A4 were abundantly expressed in the coenurus, indicating that the SLC1A4 genes might be functional divergent in T. multiceps. Sugars are also centrally involved in metabolism and energy production and storage, and we identified in the T. multiceps genome one glucose and four sugar transporters having a high level of expression in the cyst wall or protoscoleces. Moreover, two important genes mediating glucose metabolism and energy production (glucose-6-phosphate-dehydrogenase, Tm1G004355 and glucose-6-phosphate isomerase, Tm3G008866), were highly expressed in protoscoleces (Supplementary Material S2). Besides obtaining nutrients from the mammalian host, the coenurus stage causes neurologic dysfunction by the production and release of neurotoxic substances. During metabolism, the consumption of glucose and oxygen by protoscoleces results in the production of carbon dioxide that is released outside the cyst wall, resulting in host cell toxicity. Additionally, there is high expression of sodium/potassium-transporting ATPase (Tm1G003772) and calcium pump (Tm1G002964) in protoscoleces and this may impact on ion homeostasis in the host neuron microenvironment. It has been shown that the imbalance of glutamate diffusing over synaptosomes could change synaptic function and interfere with signal transmission, causing toxicity in the host nervous system.46 The expression of glutamate dehydrogenase 1 (Tm3G009148; FPKM = 577) in protoscoleces was significantly higher than in the other stages (P < 0.001), and this could result in an imbalance in the concentration of glutamate in the host brain, resulting in synaptic dysfunction. Moreover, two gene homologues of neurodegenerative disorder were highly expressed in protoscoleces (Supplementary Material S2), and these may also contribute to nervous system toxicity.3.7. Environment adaptation and immune evasion contributed by horizontal gene transferHorizontal gene transfer (HGT), or the passage of genetic material between non-mating species, is a ubiquitous process that increases the divergence and improves the physiological metabolism of recipient organisms.47,48 We identified HGT genes in T. multiceps obtained from the host using a published determination pipeline with modifications.49Eleven genes were identified as HGT candidates in the T. multiceps genome from three hosts, including sheep (Ovis aries), dog (Canis lupus familiaris) and goat (Capra hircus) (Supplementary Table S12). In phylogenetic analysis, the 11 candidate genes displayed a close relationship with host orthologs but were much more distant from the orthologs of species close to T. multiceps (Fig. 6a and Supplementary Fig. S7a–j). Among the 11 HGT candidates, all have high identity (>70%) and coverage (>80%) with the orthologs from mammalian hosts, such as Tm1G003541 (Fig. 6b). To confirm that the HGT genes were transferred from the host rather than due to assembly error, the Illumina pair-end reads were mapped to the region flanking a HGT candidate, Tm1G003541. The results showed that the pair-end reads could cross the HGT candidate region continuously in which the flanking genes represented syntenic relationships with E. multilocularis, excepting the HGT candidate (Fig. 6c). These results indicated that the HGT candidate (Tm1G003541), which might bind to the MHCII from the host and regulate the release of Type I interferon, was probably transferred from host and play important role to interfere in the immune recognition and following immune responses. Furthermore, 8 of 11 candidates had unigene evidence from a previous shotgun assembled transcriptome of T. multiceps.2 In our transcriptome data on stages and tissues of T. multiceps, the expression of HGT candidates showed that a protein related to translational elongation (Tm1G005508) and a Hsp90 (Tm1G003541) had high expression levels, especially in the cyst wall and protoscoleces, whereas five Hsp70 proteins showed low expression patterns (Fig. 6d). The GO analysis of the 11 candidates in T. multiceps showed that the HGT could be clustered into 4 pools, including protein modification, adaptation, reproduction and heat shock (Fig. 6e). In summary, these results suggest that the T. multiceps genes transferred from hosts may play important roles in environment adaptation and immune evasion. Predicted host-origin HTGs in T. multiceps.

Genome-based new molecular targets for drug interventionCoenurosis is a devastating disease and difficult to treat and the T. multiceps genome project makes feasible the identification of novel targets for drug discovery. Historically, enzymes have been a key target group for drug discovery.50 Based on Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and clinical studies, we identified a total of 210 known drug target genes involved with 56 enzyme systems in T. multiceps (Supplementary Table S13). In addition to enzymes, kinases, GPCRs and ligand-gated ion channels (LGICs) may also be important drug targets for the treatment of T. multiceps. We identified a total of 284 kinases and 38 GPCRs in T. multiceps (Supplementary Tables S14 and S15) and 45 members of four major LGIC families. Several effective anthelminthic drugs interfere with one of the multiple forms of neural control and communication.51 Therefore, we searched the signalling pathways of neurotransmitters and identified 11 and 8 conserved genes in the Ach and serotonin pathways respectively (Supplementary Tables S16 and S17), which may serve as broad-spectrum drug targets for treating coenuriasis and other cestodiases.To identify species-specific genes in T. multiceps, we compared the above potential targets to host proteins by BLASTP (cutoff: 1 e-5). In total, no homologues of 218 specific targets genes in T. multiceps were found in humans, canines and sheep (Supplementary Material S3), indicating that these species-specific targets not only have potential for developing as diagnostics or as vaccines but may also have limited side effects on mammalian hosts.4. DiscussionSMRT sequencing offers longer length reads than second-generation sequencing technologies, making it well suited for unsolved problems in genome research.52,De novo assemblies using PacBio sequencing, as applied here, can close gaps in current reference assemblies, which are mostly composed of large repeat sequences.52 Using this high coverage genome assembly, we have identified much more TEs and tandem repeat sequences in T. multiceps than in the previously published Taenia genomes, enabling a comprehensive analysis of the content of each type of repeat sequence as well as telomere structures. The high-quality assembly allows fine annotation of gene models, facilitating evolutionary and functional analysis.The genome and transcriptome data we generated provide a valuable resource for better understanding the molecular biology, physiology, phylogeny and mechanisms of pathogenesis in T. multiceps and coenurosis. In this study, we found expansion of Tbx6 genes and their up-regulation in the adult stage of T. multiceps, which may be associated with the increased number of proglottids. We also found several genes involved in interaction with the host CNS, and several genes likely derived from horizontal transfer, as a result of adaption to the parasitic life style. Furthermore, the species-specific gene targets identified in T. multiceps provide candidatesfor development as novel immunological diagnostic markers, as well as preventative vaccines and therapeutic drugs. This high-quality T. multiceps reference genome provides not only a comprehensive foundation for deeper understanding of the genetic and evolution of tapeworms, but also an invaluable resource to accelerate the development of novel treatments and tools for the control of coenurosis.We thank W.J.

IntroductionGenetic variation can cause phenotypic variation in organisms; due to the changes in the structure of an encoded protein or gene expression level by mutations of the DNA sequence. In addition to genetic variation, gene expression can be controlled by changes in the structure of chromatin without changing the DNA sequence, and this phenomenon is termed ‘epigenetic’ control. DNA methylation and histone modification are well-known epigenetic modifications.1,2Nucleosomes are formed by a histone octamer containing two of the core histones H2A, H2B, H3, and H4, and 147 bp of DNA is wrapped around this core. The N-terminal regions of histone proteins are subject to various chemical modifications, such as methylation or acetylation, and these histone modifications are associated with gene transcription. Different histone marks can be controlled by different histone methyltransferase and can lead to different effects on gene regulation.3,4 In Arabidopsis thaliana, histone H3 lysine 9 di-methylation (H3K9me2) is associated with heterochromatic regions,5 and histone lysine methyltransferases, KRYPTONITE (KYP)/SU(VAR)3-9 HOMOLOG 4 (SUVH4), SUVH5, and SUVH6, catalyze addition of H3K9me2.6In plants, cytosines in all contexts, CG, CHG, and CHH (H is A, T, or C), can be methylated. Spontaneous epimutation is defined as heritable stochastic changes in the methylation states at CG, CHG, and CHH sites, and the rate of epimutation is overwhelmingly higher than the rate of genetic mutations in A. thaliana.7,8 Sometimes, epimutation becomes the driving force of phenotypic variation.1,2 DNA methylation has an important role in the regulation of gene expression, silencing of repeat sequences and transposons, and genome imprinting.2,9 DNA methylation in CG contexts is largely maintained by METHYLTRANSFERASE I (MET1), and those in CHG contexts are largely maintained by CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3)-associated with H3K9me2.2,6,9 CHH site methylation is maintained by CMT2 or DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE 2 (DRM2).10,11 The de novo methylation in all contexts is catalyzed by DRM2 and is triggered by 24 nucleotide small-interfering RNAs (24 nt-siRNAs) produced by the RNA interference (RNAi) pathway, termed RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Two plant-specific RNA polymerases, Polymerase IV (Pol IV) and Pol V, RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 2 (RDR2), DICER-LIKE 3 (DCL3), and ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4) proteins function in this RNAi pathway.2,12Genome-wide profiles of epigenetic information (the epigenome) are available in plants using technologies such as tiling arrays or high-throughput sequencing. High-resolution maps of epigenetic features have been obtained from whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) (bisulfite converted DNA is directly sequenced) or a combination of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) technology and high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-seq).4,13 Using these technologies, variations of DNA methylation states between accessions in a specific species or between species have been shown at the whole genome level.14–17 In A. thaliana, DNA methylation is enriched in heterochromatic regions of genomes, which consist of repetitive sequences and transposable elements (TEs).18,19 DNA methylation is also observed in the euchromatic regions, and genes having DNA methylation at CG sites in transcribed regions, termed gene-body methylation (gbM), showed high expression level.18,19Brassica rapa L. comprises commercially important vegetable crops consumed worldwide including Chinese cabbage (var. pekinensis), pak choi (var. chinensis), and komatsuna (var. perviridis), root vegetables including turnip (var. rapa), and oilseed (var. oleifera). Most cultivars of B. rapa are self-incompatible, preventing self-fertilization, and are F1 hybrid cultivars, which have increased yields relative to their parents (heterosis/hybrid vigour).20,21 Chinese cabbage forms a head with large pale-green-coloured leaves and wide white midribs and is an important vegetable in Asia. The draft genome sequence of Chinese cabbage (Chiifu-401-42) has been released and 199 accessions in B. rapa representing various morphotypes have been re-sequenced.22,23 The B. rapa genome has undergone a whole-genome triplication (WGT), which results in multiple copies of paralogous genes. Three subgenomes, the least fractioned (LF) subgenome and two more fractionated subgenomes (MF1 and MF2), were found in B. rapa genome, and biased gene fractionation and dominant gene expression pattern among the subgenomes were shown.22,24,25The aim of this study was to identify the DNA methylation states at the whole genome levels and to clarify the relationship between DNA methylation and transcription, small RNA expression, and H3K9me2 modification in B. rapa. B. rapa is related to the model plant A. thaliana, which enables us to compare the conservation and diversification of epigenetic states between orthologous genes of these species. In addition, B. rapa has more repetitive sequences than A. thaliana and has experienced WGT after speciation, which allows us to examine the effect of differences in genome composition on epigenetic states. Furthermore, the knowledge of the DNA methylation state, small RNA expression, and H3K9me2 placement at the whole genome level will be useful for examining natural variation, change of epigenetic states by abiotic or biotic stress, and understanding epigenetic states related to agronomically important traits using segregation of loci.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and growth conditionsA Chinese cabbage inbred line developed in a previous study, RJKB-T24, was used as plant material.26 Plants were grown on agar-solidified Murashige and Skoog (MS) plates with 1.0% (w/v) sucrose under long day condition (16 h light) at 21°C. For WGBS, small RNA sequencing (small RNA-seq), and ChIP analyses, first and second leaves were harvested from plants at 14 days after sowing.2.2. Whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS)Genomic DNAs from 14 days first and second leaves were isolated using DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNAs were fragmented to 100–300 bp length by sonication. DNA-end repair, 3'-dA overhang, ligation of methylated sequence adaptors, and bisulfite treatment by ZYMO EZ DNA Methylation-Gold kit (ZYMO RESEARCH) were performed for constructing bisulfite sequence library. The library was sequenced using Illumina Hiseq2000 (100 bp paired end).The reads of WGBS were mapped to the B. rapa reference genome v.1.5 (http://brassicadb.org/brad/) or to RJKB-T24 re-sequenced genome, whose SNPs were replaced in the reference genome, using Bowtie2 version 2.2.3 and Bismark v0.14.3.27 In order to estimate methylation levels of CG, CHG, and CHH contexts, the numbers of methylated and unmethylated reads were extracted on each cytosine position using bismark_methylation_extractor script with the paired-end parameter. The methylation level at each cytosine position was calculated by dividing the number of methylated cytosines (mC) reads by the total reads.2.3. Classification of gene-body methylation (gbM)We classified cytosine sites into methylated and unmethylated cytosines by employing a binomial test, following Lister et al.18 We estimated the sequence context-specific error rates of bisulfite conversion (0.0173 for CG, 0.0178 for CHG, and 0.0215 for CHH sites) from the mapping result of the unmethylated phage genome, and used these values for the binomial test. We applied the test only to the cytosine site with >2 WGBS coverage, and used a significant cut-off of two-tailed P-value < 0.01 to detect mC.The smaller PCG is, the higher CG methylation level is. We defined body- and under-methylated genes as genes with PCG < 0.05 and PCG > 0.95, respectively. Using the same rationale, we calculated PCHG and PCHH for CHG and CHH methylation, respectively.2.4. Small RNA sequencing (small RNA-seq)Total RNA was isolated from 14 days first and second leaves of B. rapa using TRIzol Reagent (Thermo Fisher) with DNase I treatments. Small RNAs of 17–30 nucleotide (nt) were purified. The sequence library was prepared using Oligonucleotide sequences for TruSeqTM Small RNA Sample Prep kits (Illumina), and small RNA-seq was performed using Illumina Hiseq2000 (36 bp single end).The reads of small RNA-seq were purged from low quality reads or adapter sequences using cutadapt version 1.7.1 and Trim Galore! version 0.3.7. Then the reads were mapped to the B. rapa reference genome v.1.5 using Bowtie2 version 2.2.3. To examine the size distribution of mapped small RNAs, we classified the alignment reads by length. The 24 nt aligned reads were used to identify 24 nt-siRNA clusters by clustering adjacent reads using bedtools 2.15.0 with the ‘merge –d 200 (reads within 200 nt from each other were merged in one cluster)’ parameter. Clusters that contain at least five reads were picked up.2.5. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq)ChIP experiments were performed as described by Kawanabe et al.29 One gram of 14 days first and second leaves of B. rapa was used for ChIP analysis and anti-H3K9me2 (ACTIVE MOTIF, 39753) antibody was used. Before the ChIP-seq, we validated the enrichment of purified immunoprecipitated DNAs by qPCR using the positive and negative control primer sets of H3K9me2 previously developed.29 Purified immunoprecipitated DNAs and input DNA were sequenced by Hiseq2000 (36 bp single end). The reads of ChIP-seq were purged from low quality reads or adapter sequences using cutadapt version 1.7.1 and Trim Galore! version 0.3.7. Then the reads were mapped to the B. rapa reference genome v.1.5 using Bowtie2 version 2.2.3. We performed peak calling on alignment results using model-based analysis for ChIP-seq (MACS) 2 2.1.0 and identified the regions having H3K9me2 as peaks. Primer sequences used in this study are shown in Supplementary Table S1.2.6. Bisulfite sequencingGenomic DNAs from 14 days first and second leaves was isolated using DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). A total of 500 ng DNA was fragmented by sonication and fragments were approximately 300–800 bp in length. MethylCode Bisulfite Conversion Kit (Thermo Fisher) was used for chemical bisulfite reaction and PCR was performed using bisulfite treated DNAs as templates. PCR conditions were 95 °C for 2 min followed by 40 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 55 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s. Amplified PCR fragments were gel purified using GENECLEAN III Kit (MP Biomedicals) and cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector (Promega). Ten independent clones were sequenced. Primers used for bisulfite sequencing are listed in Supplementary Table S1.3. Results3.1. Whole genome DNA methylation states of RJKB-T24We performed WGBS using 14-day old first and second leaves of the Chinese cabbage (B. rapa) inbred line, RJKB-T24. Approximately 192 M clear reads were obtained and 70 M reads were uniquely mapped on the B. rapa reference genome (from chromosome 1 to 10) using Bismark, about 27 times the depth of the sequenced genome. Approximately 86% of cytosine sites in the regions from A01 to A10 were covered (Supplementary Table S2). Most of the methylated CG sites were heavily methylated, while methylated CHG and CHH sites had low methylation levels (Fig. 1A). A total of 70% of methyl-CG sites were fully methylated (Fig. 1A), which is higher than that in A. thaliana (20–30%).18 The average of methylation levels of the whole genome (total) for CG, CHG, and CHH sites were 36.5%, 13.4%, and 5.3%, respectively, and interspersed repeat regions (IRRs) were heavily methylated (CG, 73.7%; CHG, 33.8%; CHH, 13.0%) (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Fig. S1). These methylation levels were slightly lower but similar to those seen using the reference genome with scaffold sequences or RJKB-T24 re-sequenced genome as a template of mapped reads (Supplementary Table S3), indicating that sequence polymorphisms between RJKB-T24 and the reference line did not greatly affect the quantification of the DNA methylation levels. We validated the WGBS results in the five selected regions by bisulfite sequencing (Supplementary Fig. S2). DNA methylation level detected by WGBS. (A) Distribution of the percentage of methylation site at each context. (B) Average of DNA methylation levels in the 2-kb upstream (2k-up), exon, intron, and 2-kb downstream (2k-down) regions, and interspersed repeats regions (IRRs). ‘Total’ represents the average of DNA methylation levels in all regions of the genome.DNA methylation level detected by WGBS.

More genes were detected by WGBS than by MeDIP-seq, and about 90% of genes having MeDIP-peaks in the 2-kb upstream, exon, intron, and 2-kb downstream regions overlapped with genes having DNA methylation detected by WGBS (Supplementary Fig. S3). The correlation coefficient between the methylation levels of all cytosine sites detected by WGBS and methylation levels detected by MeDIP-seq [log 10 score of reads per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads (RPKM), RPKM > 0.01] in genic regions (200-bp upstream/exon/intron/200 bp-downstream regions) was high (r = 0.76, P < 10e-6), indicating that WGBS data is consistent with the MeDIP-seq data. These results indicate that MeDIP-seq detected highly methylated regions, while WGBS can examine all DNA methylation contexts including the regions detected by MeDIP-seq analysis.3.2. Genes having DNA methylation and their expression levelsWe examined the impact of DNA methylation on transcription by comparing the DNA methylation data to previous RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) data with two replicates generated from samples using the same tissue and stage, but independently harvested.30,31 The correlation coefficient between the CG, CHG, and CHH methylation levels at specific genic regions (2-kb, 500-bp, and 200-bp upstream and downstream regions, first exon, exon, first intron, and intron) and the expression levels (log 2 score of FPKM, FPKM > 0.01) was examined. There was a negative correlation between methylation levels and expression levels, except for CG methylation in exon regions, CHG methylation in the 2-kb upstream region, and CHH methylation in the 500-bp and 2-kb upstream regions (Table 1). CG and CHG methylation levels in the 200-bp upstream and 500-bp downstream regions and CG, CHG, and CHH methylation levels in the 200-bp downstream regions correlated with lower expression levels. CG, CHG, and CHH methylation levels in the first exon and first intron also showed negative correlation with expression levels. In summary, there were negative correlations between CHG and CHH methylation levels of the exon and intron regions and expression levels, whereas no negative correlation was found between the expression level and CG methylation levels of the exon and intron region (Table 1).

Comparison of DNA methylation states of B. rapa genes with orthologous genes of A. thalianaWe first identified gbM genes (methylated only in the CG context), under-methylated genes (under-methylated at all three types of sites), and genes having methylation at all three types of sites, in B. rapa by a probabilistic approach (see Section 2.3).28 A total of 3,521 of 29,612 genes (11.9%) were classified as gbM genes. The proportion of gbM genes in B. rapa is lower than that in A. thaliana (23.3%; using the same calculation methods on the data from Lister et al.18) (Supplementary Table S4). A total of 3,141 of 29,612 genes (10.6%) had methylation both in the CG, CHG, and CHH contexts, which was higher than that in A. thaliana (3.6%), while 14,583 of 29,612 genes (49.2%) were categorized into under-methylated genes in B. rapa, similar to that in A. thaliana (44.1%) (Supplementary Table S4).Next, we compared the DNA methylation states between the orthologous genes of B. rapa and A. thaliana. Because B. rapa experienced a WGT event,22,24,25 there are from one to three A. thaliana orthologous genes in B. rapa. The previous study provided the list of orthologous genes based on the similarity of protein sequences and syntenic information.24 The orthologous genes were found in A. thaliana genes for 3,448 of 3,521 gbM genes in B. rapa, 2,976 of which were one-to-one orthologous genes between the two species (Table 2). A total of 1,904 of these 2,976 genes (64.0%) had gbM in A. thaliana. A total of 14,147 of 14,583 under-methylated genes in B. rapa had the orthologous genes in A. thaliana, and this was reduced to 10,333 one-to-one orthologous genes. Only 1,842 of these 10,333 genes (17.8%) had gbM in the A. thaliana genome (Table 2). These results suggest gbM tended to be conserved between orthologous genes in B. rapa and A. thaliana. Comparison of gbM states between orthologous genes in B. rapa and A. thalianagbM, gene-body methylation.aB. rapa genes having sequence homology to A. thaliana genes with removal where more than two B. rapa genes in A. thaliana.Comparison of gbM states between orthologous genes in B. rapa and A. thalianagbM, gene-body methylation.aB. rapa genes having sequence homology to A. thaliana genes with removal where more than two B. rapa genes in A. thaliana.We further compared the level of gbM (level of CG methylation) between orthologous genes in B. rapa and A. thaliana. Again, we found significant correlations between them in all three subgenome domains of B. rapa, LF, MF1, and MF2 (r = 0.433 for LF; r = 0.393 for MF1; r = 0.402 for MF2; P < 10-5 by a permutation test in all three cases; Fig. 2).24 We also compared the levels of gbM between paralogous genes in B. rapa that were derived in WGT event, and found significant correlations between them (r = 0.467 for LF vs. MF1; r = 0.494 for LF vs. MF2; r = 0.442 for MF1 vs. MF2; P < 10-5 by a permutation test in all three cases; Supplementary Fig. S4), indicating that gbM was conserved between paralogous genes in B. rapa. The scatter plots for the level of CG methylation between A. thaliana and B. rapa orthologous genes in the three subgenomes. Correlation of CG methylation levels between A. thaliana and B. rapa orthologous genes in LF, MF1, and MF2 were 0.433 (n = 8, 040; P-value < 10-5), 0.393 (n = 5, 223; P-value < 10-5), and 0.402 (n = 4, 580; P-value < 10-5), respectively. P-values were calculated by a permutation test.The scatter plots for the level of CG methylation between A. thaliana and B. rapa orthologous genes in the three subgenomes.

P-values were calculated by a permutation test.3.4. Small RNA sequencing24 nt siRNAs are associated with targeting DNA methylation to complementary sequences by RdDM.12 To examine the relationship between the distribution of 24 nt siRNAs and DNA methylation, we performed small RNA-seq. A total of 47.4 M clean reads were obtained, and 6.6 M reads (14.0%) were uniquely mapped on the B. rapa genome. A total of 3.7 of 6.6 M reads (55.3%) were mapped on the IRRs (Supplementary Table S5). The majority of small RNAs were 24 nt in length. The second and third most abundant small RNAs were 23 nt and 21 nt in length, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S5). We identified 65,142 clusters of 24 nt siRNAs in total, and 11,354, 1,678, 2,057, and 8,795 genes had more than one 24 nt-siRNA cluster in the 2-kb upstream, exon, intron, and 2-kb downstream regions, respectively (Supplementary Table S6).We compared 24 nt-siRNA level (RPKM) and DNA methylation level of each sliding window of per 100 kb, and 24 nt-siRNA levels were most associated with CHH methylation levels (Fig. 3A). We compared the regions having 24 nt-siRNA clusters and regions having DNA methylation detected by WGBS. About 70–80% of genes having 24 nt-siRNA clusters in the 2-kb upstream, exon, intron, and 2-kb downstream regions overlapped with genes having DNA methylation detected by WGBS (Supplementary Fig. S6). About 48.0%, 39.0%, and 60.0% of total 24 nt-siRNA clusters overlapped with CG, CHG, and CHH methylation, respectively, and 45.2%, 35.9%, and 60.5% of 24 nt-siRNA clusters in IRRs overlapped with CG, CHG, and CHH methylation, respectively (Fig. 3B). This indicates that regions having 24 nt-siRNA clusters tended to have CHH methylation rather than CG and CHG methylation. The average methylation levels for CG, CHG, and CHH sites in the regions overlapping 24 nt-siRNA clusters were 87.7%, 51.4%, and 21.6%, respectively (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S1). DNA methylation levels overlapping the 24 nt-siRNA clusters were high regardless of where the IRRs were located within the genome (Supplementary Figs S1 and S7). The comparison between 24 nt-siRNA or H3K9me2 level and DNA methylation level.

Genes having 24 nt-siRNAs in exon regions tended to show a wide range of expression (Fig. 5). Average expression level of genes having 24 nt-siRNAs in exons was higher than that of total genes, and it was also significantly higher than that of genes not having 24 nt-siRNAs in an exon (permutation test, P < 0.001) (Fig. 5). Of genes having 24 nt-siRNAs in exons, genes that were more lowly expressed tended to have CG, CHG, and CHH methylation, while more highly expressed genes tended to be under-methylated (Supplementary Fig. S8).

Total indicates the log 2 score of FPKM in all genes (FPKM < 0.01).3.5. Chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing using H3K9me2 antibodyTo examine the relationship between DNA methylation and H3K9me2 in the B. rapa genome, we performed ChIP-seq analysis using an antibody against H3K9me2. A total of 37.8 M and 40.0 M clean reads were obtained from input-DNA-seq and ChIP-seq, respectively. A total of 18.2 M (input-DNA-seq, 48.2%) and 11.8 M reads (ChIP-seq, 29.5%) were uniquely mapped on the B. rapa genome, respectively (Supplementary Table S5). In total, 8.4 M ChIP-seq reads were mapped on the genic regions including exon, intron, and 2-kb upstream and downstream regions. The proportion of mapped reads of ChIP-seq in each of the four regions was similar to those of Input-DNA-seq (Supplementary Table S7). In the ChIP-seq data, 5.6 M (47.4%) reads mapped on the IRRs was higher than the percentage of mapped reads on the IRRs using input-DNA-seq data (39.1%) (Supplementary Table S5), but lower than using the previous MeDIP-seq data (63.9%; 36 bp single end).30 A total of 9,920 H3K9me2 peaks were identified in RJKB-T24. A total of 1,293, 1,654, 449, and 895 genes had more than one H3K9me2 peak within 2-kb upstream, exon, intron, and 2-kb downstream regions, respectively (Supplementary Table S8). A total of 7,268 of 9,920 H3K9me2 peaks (73.3%) were found in the IRRs (Supplementary Table S8).We examined the relationship between having H3K9me2 marks and expression levels (log 2 score of FPKM, FPKM > 0.01). The average expression level in genes having H3K9me2 peaks in all four regions, especially in the exon and intron regions, was lower than that of total genes, and the average expression level of genes having H3K9me2 in the exon and intron regions was significantly lower than genes that do not have H3K9me2 peaks (permutation test, P < 0.001) (Fig. 5).We compared H3K9me2 levels (RPKM) and DNA methylation level or 24 nt-siRNA levels (RPKM) of each sliding window of per 100 kb. H3K9me2 levels were associated with DNA methylation levels, but there was no difference among the three contexts. In contrast, the association between H3K9me2 levels and 24 nt-siRNA levels was low (Fig. 3A). In genes having H3K9me2 peaks, about 50% of them overlapped with genes having DNA methylation detected by WGBS in each of the 2-kb upstream, intron, and 2-kb downstream regions, while about 20% of genes overlapped with genes having DNA methylation in exon regions (Supplementary Fig. S9). The regions having H3K9me2 had CHH methylation, especially in IRRs, rather than CG or CHG methylation (Fig. 3B). The average of methylation levels for CG, CHG, and CHH sites in the regions overlapping H3K9me2 peaks were 53.6%, 24.2%, and 8.6%, respectively (Fig. 4, Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating increased DNA methylation levels in the region covering the H3K9me2 peaks. In the regions overlapping H3K9me2 peaks, DNA methylation levels were higher in IRRs (CG; 77.5%, CHG; 31.2%, CHH; 10.4%) in comparison to all regions (Supplementary Fig. S1). However, 6.2% of H3K9me2 peaks overlapped with 24 nt-siRNA clusters, and 4.3% of H3K9me2 peaks overlapped with 24 nt-siRNA clusters in IRRs, indicating that majority of H3K9me2 accumulation was not associated with 24 nt-siRNAs (Supplementary Table S9).3.6. Genetic and DNA methylation states variation between B. rapa and A. thalianaWe compared DNA methylation states at specific B. rapa genes against the orthologous genes of A. thaliana. A total of 1,514 and 1,472 B. rapa genes of MeDIP-peaks had CG, CHG, and CHH methylation (heavily methylated genes) in the exon and intron regions, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S10), and 911 genes were in common between methylated exons and introns and distributed evenly over all chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S11). About 90% of these 911 heavily methylated genes had IRRs in exon and/or intron, and 99% of these IRRs were methylated (Supplementary Table S10), indicating that heavy methylation in exon and intron regions of these 911 genes is due to the presence of IRRs targeted for DNA methylation.A total of 424 of the 911 genes from B. rapa had putative orthologous genes in A. thaliana including paralogous genes. This was reduced to 395 genes in A. thaliana following the removal of genes where two or three B. rapa genes showed sequence similarity to one A. thaliana gene (Table 2). Of the 395 genes, 217 (54.9%) were categorized into under-methylated genes and 91 (23.0%) into gbM genes (Table 2). The frequency of under-methylated and gbM genes was similar to that of the total genes (under-methylated genes, 64.7%; gbM genes, 17.7%), suggesting that heavily methylated states were not conserved between orthologous genes between B. rapa and A. thaliana.Of the 424 genes in B. rapa, 234 genes (55.2%) showed no expression, categorized into Group-0 (Supplementary Fig. S12). In A. thaliana, we have divided the level of gene expression into six categories using microarray data; the first and sixth groups had the lowest and highest levels of expression, respectively.32 Of 395 A. thaliana genes with sequence homology to heavily methylated B. rapa, 325 genes were on the microarray, and the proportion classified from first to sixth groups were 11% (first, lowest), 11% (second), 14% (third), 16% (fourth), 23% (fifth), and 25% (sixth, highest), respectively (Supplementary Fig. S12), indicating that there was no tendency of transcription suppression. These results indicate that A. thaliana genes, which showed sequence similarity to heavily methylated genes in B. rapa, had neither heavy DNA methylation nor low expression levels.4. DiscussionWe examined the DNA methylation states and distribution of 24 nt-siRNAs and H3K9me2 of B. rapa at the whole genome level. DNA methylation and H3K9me2 are classified as repressive epigenetic marks and 24 nt-siRNAs are involved in RdDM. We showed how these three factors interact with each other and affect gene expression levels in B. rapa.4.1. DNA methylation states at the whole genome levels in B. rapaWe performed WGBS using an inbred line of Chinese cabbage, RJKB-T24, and these data were consistent with our previous MeDIP-seq data.30 The WGBS allowed us to assess different DNA methylation sequence contexts and was more sensitive. The average methylation levels for CG, CHG, and CHH sites in chromosome A01–A10 were 36.5%, 13.4%, and 5.3%, respectively, in RJKB-T24. Previously, WGBS was performed in B. rapa and the average methylation levels for CG, CHG, and CHH sites were 52.4%, 31.8%, and 8.3%, respectively,33 and 37.2%, 17.3%, and 4.4%, respectively.16 Our results were similar to the latter report, though DNA methylation levels varied between lines or tissues. Most CG sites were highly methylated unlike in A. thaliana, but similar to previous reports of B. rapa.16,33 High levels of DNA methylation in the IRRs including TEs or repetitive sequences were detected, which is a common observation not only in B. rapa but also in other plant species.17,33–354.2. Heavy methylation in genic regions results in silencing of transcriptionWe examined how DNA methylation affects gene expression levels using WGBS and RNA-seq data of identical tissues and stages. Promoter methylated genes tended to have lower expression levels in A. thaliana.36 Promoter methylation also repressed gene expression in rice, and gene repression by DNA methylation in the transcriptional termination regions was stronger than the effect of DNA methylation in the promoter region.37 In our study, DNA methylation in the upstream and downstream regions of genes was negatively associated with expression levels, especially DNA methylation in the 200-bp upstream and downstream regions.There is a strong negative relationship between DNA methylation at all sequence contexts in the first exon/intron and expression in A. thaliana.38 DNA methylation in the region of the first exon is much more tightly linked to transcriptional silencing than is methylation in the upstream promoter region in humans.39 Our results also showed methylation at CG, CHG, or CHH in the first exon or first intron associated with gene silencing. In soybean, there is positive correlation between CG gbM and expression levels, while CHG or CHH methylation in gene bodies was negatively associated with expression levels.40 In our study, CHG and CHH methylation in exon or intron regions results in lower expression levels, while there was no negative association between CG methylation in exons (except for in the first exon) and expression levels. This indicates that CHG and CHH methylation in exon or intron regions are associated with gene silencing. In contrast, the frequency of moderately expressed genes (Group-4) having only CG methylation or gbM was higher than in the total genes (Supplementary Fig. S13), indicating that genes having gbM showed higher expression levels, which is consistent with gbM genes in other plant species.174.3. Conservation and diversification of DNA methylation states of genic regions between B. rapa and A. thalianaWe categorized genes into three groups by DNA methylation types, gbM, heavily methylated, and under-methylated genes (Table 2). Of 911 heavily methylated genes, 424 (46.5%) had sequence homology to genes in A. thaliana, while more than 97% of gbM genes and under-methylated genes had sequence homology to genes in A. thaliana (Table 2), indicating that heavily methylated genes tend to lose orthologous genes in B. rapa. A. thaliana genes, which showed sequence similarity to heavily methylated genes in B. rapa, did not tend to have DNA methylation. In B. rapa, most heavily methylated genes contained IRRs in the exon/intron regions that were heavily methylated. These results suggest heavy methylation in genes is not conserved between species and heavy methylation occurs after speciation and is caused by transposon insertion that can drive variation of DNA methylation between species.41,42Conservation of gbM in orthologous genes between species, especially in closely related species, has been found.16,41,43,44 In our study, there was a significant correlation in gbM between orthologous genes in B. rapa and A. thaliana. Significant correlation in gbM between paralogous genes was also found in B. rapa. These results suggest that gbM is conserved not only after speciation but also after WGT. Although gbM is conserved between A. thaliana and B. rapa, about 14% of genes had gbM in A. thaliana, while only 0.5% of genes had gbM in B. rapa.16 In this study, about 23% of genes had gbM in A. thaliana, and 12% of genes had gbM in B. rapa. Although the percentages are different because of the different analysis methods, the lower frequency of gbM genes in B. rapa than in A. thaliana is consistent. In Eutrema salsugineum and Conringia planisiliqua, loss of CMT3 function resulted in loss of gbM,16,45 suggesting that the lower numbers of gbM genes in B. rapa than in A. thaliana may be difference of CMT3 function.4.4. siRNAs are associated with DNA methylation24 nt-siRNAs guide methylation of cytosine in all classes of sequence contexts, termed RdDM, and the most abundant targets of RdDM are repetitive sequences or transposons, especially smaller and younger ones in euchromatic regions in A. thaliana.10,12 We identified 65,142 clusters of 24 nt-siRNAs using uniquely mapped reads and 56% of the clusters were detected in IRRs. This frequency of the 24 nt-siRNA clusters in IRRs is lower than that of H3K9me2 peaks (73.3%) and MeDIP-peaks (86.5%) in IRRs.30 The 24 nt-siRNA levels or the 24 nt-siRNA clusters were more associated with CHH methylation than CG and CHG methylation in B. rapa, suggesting that this CHH methylation was via RdDM. Surprisingly, the average of methylation levels for CG, CHG, and CHH sites in the regions overlapping 24 nt-siRNA clusters was quite high even in the non-IRRs, indicating that 24 nt-siRNA clusters are strongly associated with DNA methylation.We examined whether 24 nt-siRNA clusters nearby or within genes affect their expression. Genes having 24 nt-siRNA clusters in the 2-kb upstream or 2-kb downstream did not affect gene expression levels. In contrast, genes having 24 nt-siRNA clusters in exons showed a broad range of expression levels and genes having 24 nt-siRNA clusters in the exon regions tended to show higher expression levels. There is a tendency for negative correlation between the DNA methylation and expression level in genes having 24 nt-siRNA clusters in the exon regions, however, 24 nt-siRNA clusters in exons were not associated with DNA methylation in some genes, especially genes showing higher expression.4.5. Moderate association between H3K9me2 and DNA methylationThe level of H3K9me2 associated with DNA methylation levels and methylation levels at CG, CHG, and CHH sites in the H3K9me2 regions was higher than the genome average levels, similar to the results in A. thaliana.5 The greatest fraction of CHG methylation overlapped with H3K9me2 positive regions in A. thaliana,5 while there was no tendency for H3K9me2 to be associated with CHG methylation in B. rapa. A greater fraction of CHH methylation overlapped with H3K9me2 in the IRRs. In A. thaliana, self-reinforcing mechanisms between CMT2/3 and KYP (SUVH4)/SUVH5/SUVH6 have been proposed, and CMT2 and CMT3 add CHH and CHG methylation, respectively.11,46,47 The genome sequences of most euchromatic regions were determined in B. rapa, which is approximately half of the total genome size, but the sequences of the heterochromatic regions including centromere or pericentromere covering TEs and repetitive sequences were not determined.22 This may result in the weak correlation in B. rapa because association between H3K9me2 and CHG methylation levels are mostly high in TEs.5 In maize there is no orthologous gene of AtCMT2, and there is no strong correlation between CHG methylation and H3K9me2.48 Although the putative orthologous genes of AtCMT2, AtCMT3, AtKYP/AtSUVH4, AtSUVH5, AtSUVH6 were confirmed in the B. rapa genome,22,49,50 the basis of no strong association between CHG and H3K9me2 is that the interaction between cytosine methyltransferase and H3K9 methyltransferase in B. rapa may be different from that in A. thaliana, which may explain the smaller number of gbM genes in B. rapa.In A. thaliana, H3K9me2 methylation is associated with gene silencing, especially in pericentromeric regions.5 Although the number of genes having H3K9me2 peaks in exon and intron regions was small, the average expression levels in genes having H3K9me2 in the exon and intron regions were lower than the total genes. However, the proportion of non-expressed genes having H3K9me2 was lower than genes having CG, CHG, and CHH methylation or MeDIP-peaks,30 suggesting that in B. rapa some genes that were expressed at a lower level but not completely silenced, had H3K9me2.In A. thaliana, TEs located in pericentromeric regions are associated more with high levels of H3K9me2 than in euchromatic arms. In this study, reads mapped to IRRs from ChIP-seq using H3K9me2 antibody (47%) was higher than that of Input-DNA-seq (39%), but this percentage is lower than that of MeDIP-seq (64%),30 suggesting that H3K9me2 shows moderate association with IRRs in B. rapa. In A. thaliana, siRNA clusters were associated with H3K9me2 in pericentromeric regions, but generally not in euchromatic arms.5 In maize, H3K9me2 levels at RdDM loci were similar to genic loci and 2-fold lower than non-RdDM loci.48 In B. rapa, an association between H3K9me2 and 24 nt-siRNA clusters was not detected. We could not examine the relationship between H3K9me2 and 24 nt-siRNA clusters or IRRs in pericentromere or centromere regions due to the limitation of available reference genome sequence information. At least in the euchromatic regions of B. rapa, H3K9me2 is moderately associated with IRRs, but the 24 nt-siRNA clusters did not associate with H3K9me2. However, immunostaining using H3K9me2 antibody in interphase nuclei revealed H3K9me2 was present in heterochromatin of chromocenters in B. rapa, similar to the results in A. thaliana,51,52 suggesting that H3K9me2 might be associated with IRRs or 24 nt-siRNA clusters in pericentromere or centromere regions in B. rapa.We thank Etsuko Itabashi, Kiyomi Imamura, Makiko Tosaka, Taiji Kikuchi, and Terumi Horiuchi for their technical assistance.

IntroductionLike in most genomes of higher organisms, transposable elements or mobile elements (‘MEs’ hereafter) constitute a major component in the human genome. The percentage of MEs in the human genome was reported to be from 45 to 48.5%,1–3 and in this study we revised it to 52.1% based on the most recent reference genome sequences and ME annotation. This percentage is likely to increase slightly with further improvements of the human genome sequences, especially for the constitutive heterochromatin regions, and with tools capable of detecting more diverged and novel MEs.In the human genome, MEs are mainly represented by retrotransposons, which propagate in a copy-and-paste fashion via transcribed RNAs as the intermediates, and they are divided into long-terminal repeat (LTR) and non-LTR retrotransposons.2,3 The LTR retrotransposon group is characterized by the presence of LTRs at the two ends of the internal viral sequences, and it is mainly represented by the endogenous retrovirus (ERVs) or human ERVs (HERVs). These ERVs came from exogenous virus affecting germline cells and integrating into the genomes during different stages of primate and human evolution, and they constitute ~8% of the human genome.4 The non-LTR retrotransposon group consists of several very distinct types, including Short-INterspersed Elements (SINEs), Long INterspersed Elements (LINEs), and a chimeric type of repeat elements (SINE-R/VNTR/Alu or SVA). Non-LTR retrotransposons share the common properties of having a 3' poly(A) tail and L1-based target-primed reverse transcription (TPRT) mechanism for retrotransposition.4,5 Among non-LTR MEs, Alu elements, representing the relative young and most successful SINEs by number in primates, have more than 1 million copies and contribute to ~13% of the human genome.4,6 L1s, representing the dominant group of the LINEs, have more than half million copies and make the largest contribution to the human genome by sequence length (~17%). L1s with full coding capacity are also responsible for transposing all non-LTR MEs.7,8 SVAs, emerged as the newest and most active group of retrotransposons that are mainly found within the hominid group of primates, have ~5,000 copies and contribute to ~0.1% of the human genome.9,10Despite initially being considered to junk DNA, implying that they had no function,11 research work, mostly from the last two decades, has convincingly demonstrated that MEs make very significant contributions in shaping the evolution of genomes and impacting gene function via a variety of mechanisms. These mechanisms range from generation of insertional mutations and causing genomic instability, creation of new genes and splicing isoforms, and exon shuffling to alteration of gene expression and epigenetic regulation.12–22 Functioning also as endogenous insertional mutagens, MEs are known to be responsible for causing certain genetic diseases in humans.23,24More recently, MEs are also shown to contribute to the generation of tandem repeats and providing definitive regulatory function or potentials. It was shown that at least 23% of all tandem repeats, another type of repetitive elements, were derived from transposable elements.25 In a recent study, Ward et al. demonstrated that under a heterologous regulatory environment, regulatory sites in MEs, including those specific to humans, can be activated to alter histone modifications and DNA methylation as well as expression of nearby genes in both germline and somatic cells.26 A profound implication of this observation is that lineage- and species-specific MEs can provide novel regulatory sites to the host genome, which can potentially regulate nearby genes’ expression in a lineage- and species-specific manner and lead to phenotypic differences. A very recent study added such an example by showing that an ERV element is responsible for regulating innate immunity in humans by controlling the expression of adjacent IFN-induced genes.27Past and ongoing retrotransposition generates genetic diversity among species and among individuals within the same species.3,28–30 Therefore, analysis of species-specific MEs can help understand the roles of MEs in speciation and species-specific phenotypes. In the human genome, certain members from L1, Alu, SVA, and HERV families are still active in retrotransposition, and they are responsible for generating HS-MEs and MEs that are polymorphic among humans by the presence or absence of the insertions.8,31,32 So far, a few studies have also examined HS-MEs as being present in the human genome, but not in the orthologous regions of any other primate genomes.30,33,34 Among these, the study by Mills et al., representing the most comprehensive analysis of species-specific at the genome-scale, identified a total of 7,786 and 2,933 MEs that are specific to human and chimpanzee, respectively.30 This study was done with earlier versions of the human and chimpanzee genome sequences (GRHc35/hg17 and CGSC1.1/panTrol1.1), which contained more unsequenced regions and assembly errors, in particular for the chimpanzee genome, and with no other primate genome sequences available. Since then, the genome sequences of human and chimpanzee both have been subjected to several major improvements, and the genome sequences of many additional closely related primates have also become available.35–40 These additional primate genomes can be useful in providing complementary information to chimpanzee genome sequences for the analysis of HS-MEs. Motivated by these factors, we developed a more robust multi-way comparative genomic approach to compare the human genome with that of nine non-human primate genomes. We identified a total of ~15,000 HS-MEs, among which more than 8,000 were reported as HS-MEs for the first time. This dataset represents a major improvement over prior studies and permitted us to provide a more complete and accurate picture about the recent DNA transposition in the human genome with several novel observations.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sources of primate genomic sequencesThe human genome sequences used in this study was the latest version released in December 2013 (GRCh38/UCSC hg38). The most recent versions of genome sequences for nine other primate species were also included. These include chimpanzee (May 2016, CSAC Pan_tro 3.0/panTro5), gorilla (December 2014, NCBI project 31265/gorGor4.1), orangutan (July 2007, WUSTL version Pongo_albelii-2.0.2/ponAbe2), gibbon (October 2012, GGSC Nleu3.0/nomLeu3), green monkey (March 2014, Chlorocebus_sabeus 1.1/chlSab2), crab-eating macaque (June 2013, WashU Macaca_fascicularis_5.0/macFas5), rhesus monkey (November 2015, BCM Mmul_8.0.1/rheMac8), baboon (anubis) (March 2012, Baylor Panu_2.0/papAnu2), and marmoset (March 2009, WUGSC 3.2/calJac3). All genome sequences in fasta format and the corresponding RepeatMasker annotation files were downloaded from the UCSC genomic website (http://genome.ucsc.edu) onto our local servers for in-house analyses. 2.2. Identification of HS-MEsOur starting list of MEs is those annotated in the human genome using RepeatMasker (http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg38/database/rmsk.txt.gz). Since RepeatMasker reports fragments of MEs interrupted by other sequences and internal inversions/deletions as individual ME entries, we performed a pre-process to integrate these fragments back to ME sequences representing the original retrotransposition events. Briefly, we examined partial MEs that are next to each other with a distance up to 50 kb, and checked their mapping positions in the repeat consensus sequence and orientation. If two neighbouring partial MEs map to the same repeat consensus sequence in the neighbouring non-overlapping regions and in the same orientation and show the presence of target-site duplications (TSDs) at the revised ME ends, we then treat these ME segments as one ME entry with the start and end positions adjusted accordingly. For LTR retrotransposons, RepeatMasker reports the two LTRs and the internal viral sequences each as a separate entry, and we grouped all components of a full-length LTR as one entry.As shown in Fig. 1, our strategy for identifying HS-MEs is to examine the sequences at the insertion site and its two flanking regions for each of the MEs (after integration) annotated in the human reference genome and compare with the sequences of the orthologous regions in each of the nine non-human primate genomes. If an ME is determined with confidence to be absent from the orthologous regions of all other primate genomes, then it is considered human-specific. Briefly, we used two tools, BLAT41 and liftOver (http://genomes.ucsc.edu), for determining the orthologous sequences and the human-specific status of MEs using the aforementioned integrated RepeatMasker ME list as input. Only MEs supported to be unique to human by both tools were included in the final list of HS-MEs. Based on whether the MEs’ flanking sequences were detected in one or more of the out-group genomes, we divided our HS-MEs into two categories. Those with one or both of the flanking sequences detected in the orthologous region of the outgroup genomes are placed in Category I, representing HS-MEs with high confidence. Those with neither of the flanking sequences detected in the orthologous region of the out-group genomes are placed in Category II, likely representing HS-MEs that are located inside another human-specific sequences. A flow chart of the method is shown in Fig. 1, and further detailed description is provided in the Supplementary materials and methods. Flow chart of identifying HS-MEs.Flow chart of identifying HS-MEs.2.3. Validation of HS-MEsTo assess the accuracy of our HS-MEs both in terms of false-positive and false-negative errors, we performed manual inspection using the UCSC genome browser with a set of 100 randomly sampled HS-ME candidates, and performed further validations using the following 3 methods. We compared our list against the previous HS-MEs list reported by Mills et al.30 and the human-specific HERV-Ks reported by Shin et al.34A total of 3,110 polymorphic ME entries present in the reference genome, representing 2,221 or 50% of entries documented in dbRIP,42 plus additional 779 entries identified by the 1000 Genome Project team43,44 were collected and cross-matched with the list of HS-ME candidates.A total of 15 randomly selected HS-ME entries were subjected to PCR validation using primate DNA samples (Details are provided in Supplementary materials and methods).2.4. Identification of TSDs and analysis of sequence motifs at the ME integration sitesThe TSDs as well as transduction and retrotransposon insertion mediated-deletions (RIMDs) for all HS-MEs were identified using in-house Perl scripts incorporating the utility of the NCBI bl2seq and UCSC liftOver tools. The method takes the human genomic sequence covering an HS-ME, plus the flanking sequence on each side and aligns them to the corresponding orthologous sequence from the chimpanzee genome (or the next closest genome with available orthologous sequences), which represents the pre-integration allele. In order to retrieve the orthologous pre-integration allele sequences, the orthologous positions of both flanking sequences of an HS-ME in the out-group genomes were identified using liftOver. For a typical Category I HS-ME, liftOver can find the orthologous region of the immediate flanking regions. However, the immediate flanking sequences of an HS-ME in human genome may not represent the pre-integration sequence due to transduction or RIMD events. Therefore, our scripts liftOver multiple subsequent blocks of flanking sequences retrieved in human genome onto the out-group genomes (100 bp per block for up to 5 kb). The liftOver results were then grouped together to identify the shortest orthologous region containing the pre-integration site, which was used to align against the two human flanking sequences using the NCBI bl2seq tool. The overlapped region in the pre-integration allele between the two aligned regions with the flanking sequences of the ME represents the TSD. For those with TSDs, a 30-bp sequence centred at each insertion site at the pre-integration alleles was extracted after removing the ME sequence and one copy of the TSDs from the ME alleles. The sequence motif for the regions covering 15 bp before and after the insertion sites was obtained using the weblogo tool (http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/logo.cgi).Entries with identified TSDs and extra sequences between the ME and either copy of the TSDs were considered candidates for ME insertion-mediated transductions and were subject to further validation (see details in the Supplementary material). For entries without TSDs, if there are extra sequences at the pre-integration site in the out-group genomes, they were considered to be candidates for RIMD in the human genome, which were subject to further validation as described in the Supplementary materials and methods.2.5. Analysis of HS-MEs in Y chromosomeThe analysis of HS-MEs for Y chromosome required some special considerations for two reasons. First, authentic Y chromosome sequences are currently available only for human, chimpanzee, green monkey, rhesus and marmoset, and they are not as complete as for autosomal chromosomes.45 Also, since the sequences for the pseudoautosomal regions were basically copied from X chromosome of the same genome, we excluded these regions from the analysis for Y chromosome.2.6. Analysis of HS-MEs’ association with genes and regulatory elementsThe genomic coordinates of genes down to individual exons and coding regions were based on GENCODE46 and NCBI RefSeq annotation47 provided in the UCSC Genome Browser. The entire genome was divided into a non-redundant list of categorized regions in gene context as coding sequence (CDS), non-coding RNA, 5'-UTR, 3'-UTR, promoter (1 kb), intron, and intergenic regions using an in-house Perl script. This order of genic region categories as listed above was used to set the priority from high to low in handling overlaps between splice forms of the same gene or different genes. For example, if a region is a CDS for one transcript/gene and is a UTR or intron for another, then this region would be categorized as CDS.For identifying HS-MEs overlapping with known transcriptional factor binding sites (TFBS), we used the ENCODE46 Transcription Factor ChIP-seq contained in the wgEncodeRegTfbsClusteredV3.bed.gz available from the UCSC Genome Browser site.3. Results3.1. Revised ME composition in the human genome and a summary of HS-MEsTo improve the accuracy in identifying HS-MEs and their TSDs and calculating the rate of retrotransposition, we pre-processed MEs annotated by RepeatMasker to integrate fragmented MEs to represent original ME events. This integration process led to a reduction of almost one million (1,180,428) in ME counts from the 5,520,017 RepeatMasker ME entries in NCBI38/hg38 to 4,339,589 (Supplementary Table S1). In the meantime, it resulted an increase of full-length MEs by 21% (data not shown). As seen in Supplementary Table S1, the number of annotated MEs showed a consistent increase in newer versions of the human reference genomes, especially between earlier updates, mainly due to improved coverage of sequenced regions. Notably, the proportion of MEs in the human reference genome increased from 48.8% for the earlier version3 to 52.1% in the latest version (GRCh38, December 2013) (Supplementary Table S1). Based on GRCh38, the copy numbers (after integration) and percentages of the genome for DNA transposons, L1s, Alus, LTRs, SVAs, and the ‘Others’ (all remaining MEs consisting of mostly non-L1 LINEs) are 295,956 (3.5%), 564,195 (17.8%), 1,132,541 (10.5%), 488,208 (9.1%), 4,933 (0.1%), and 1,733,490 (11.2%), respectively. To our knowledge, these data represent the most updated ME composition in the human reference genome. Summary of human-specific mobile elements (HS-MEs)Summary of human-specific mobile elements (HS-MEs)Using a multi-way comparative genomic approach involving comparison of human genome sequences to that of nine other closely related primates as outlined in Fig. 1, we identified a total of 14,870 HS-MEs, consisting of 8,817 Alus, 3,912 L1s, 1,571 SVAs, and 530 HERVs. By the presence/absence of flanking sequence in the non-human primate genomes, there are 14,247 in category I and 583 category II (Table 1). Among these HS-MEs, a total of 8,049 MEs were reported as HS-MEs for the first time, while 6,738 entries were shared with the previously reported HS-MEs48 (Supplementary Table S2). The complete list of HS-MEs is provided in Supplementary file S1 and in the dbRIP database (http://dbrip.org).423.2. Validation of HS-MEsDue to the complexity of the task in identifying species-specific MEs as further discussed later, data generated by computational methods are very likely to have both false positives and false negatives. While it is cost-prohibitive to experimentally validate all 14,830 HS-MEs due to the extremely large number, we managed to validate the accuracy of our HS-ME list in three ways in addition to manual checking of 100 randomly selected entries on the UCSC Genome Browser, which showed an accuracy of 98% (data not shown). First, we used polymorphic MEs as a test dataset to assess the sensitivity of method [true positive/(true positive +false negative)]. Here, we reason that polymorphic MEs represent most recent insertions into the human genomes, and thus they should be mostly, if not all, HS-MEs. Thus, any polymorphic MEs failed to be identified as human specific ME are considered as false-negatives. By cross-checking the HS-ME list with the 3,110 polymorphic MEs present in the reference genome (2,331 from dbRIP not used in training set and 779 from the 1000 genome project), we obtained a sensitivity of 95.5% (2,972/3,110) (data not shown).Second, we cross-checked the HS-MEs with the 7,786 previously reported HS-MEs by Mills et al.,30 and we obtained 6,738 entries as shared (Supplementary Table S2). Among the 1,048 entries not on our list, we found that 904 actually represented false positives from the previous study and 26 were absent in the new version of the genome sequences, 47 entries for ME types not included in our input list (mainly due to the differences between different versions of Repeatmasker), and 71 entries represent false negatives in our list (these were added to the final list of HS-MEs; Supplementary Table S2). This converts to a sensitivity of 99.0% (6,738/6,738 + 71)) for our method. Since both the polymorphic MEs and those reported by Mills et al.30 are mostly from non-repetitive regions, which are less susceptible to errors in sequencing and computational analysis, the high ratio of overlapping is expected, and these were mostly identified as category I HS-MEs in our analysis. We further compared our list with the human-specific HERV-K list published by Shin et al.34 Among the 28 ME_IN entries, 26 of them overlap with our list while the other entries were not included in the final list due to low confidence.Third, we performed validation using PCR, which is the gold standard for ascertaining MEs. We were able to validate 12 of the 13 randomly selected HS-ME loci, for which PCR was successful. This converts to a true positive rate (precision) of 92.3% or a 7% of false positive rate. Representative PCR results can be seen in Supplementary Fig. S1 and full details of all examined loci are provided in Supplementary Table S3.Overall, combining the results from the above three methods of validation, we showed that our method has a minimal sensitivity of 95.5% and a precision rate of 92.3%.3.3. Main sources for newly identified HS-MEsWe examined the contributions of different factors to the 8,049 novel HS-MEs, among ‘HS-MEs in MEs’, ME integration, non-canonical MEs (transduction, RMID, no-TSD), extra MEs in hg38 (over hg17) and use of multiple genomes, with each of these factors considered independently (redundancy exist among categories, Supplementary Table S4a) and combined in a step-wise order (Supplementary Table S4b). When each source considered independently, the top contributors of novel HS-MEs include ‘MEs in MEs’ (3,744) and non-canonical cases (3,256), followed by ME integration (972), use of multiple genomes (822), and new human genome (161) (Supplementary Table S4a). ME integration is the top contributor for novel HS-Alus, while the non-canonical MEs is the top contributor for L1, SVA, and LTR (Supplementary Table S4a). These sources collectively contributed to more than 6,000 non-redundant entries or 75% of the novel HS-MEs (Supplementary Table S4b). The remaining 25% of the novel HS-MEs are likely due to other factors such as improved version of chimpanzee genome. By percentage of novel HS-MEs among all HS-MEs across four ME types, LTR and L1 showed much higher ratios (78 and 73%, respectively) than Alu and SVA (46 and 44%, respectively) (Supplementary Table S4b).3.4. HS-MEs contributed 14 Mbp net size increase to the human genomeME insertions can lead to genome size increase via insertion of MEs, generation of TSDs, and transductions, and they can also reduce genome size via RIMD. As shown in Table 2, the occurrences of all four mechanisms and a net genome sequence increase were observed for each ME type. Collectively, all HS-MEs contributed to a total of 14.2 Mbp net genome size increase since the last common ancestor (LCA) with chimpanzee. Among ME types, L1s made the largest net increase (~8.3 Mbp), followed by Alus (~2.6 Mbp), SVAs (~2.4 Mbp), and HERVs (0.8 Mbp). As expected, HS-L1s contributed to the largest size changes from insertion, IMD, and transductions due to their large insert size and high copy number, while HS-Alus contributed to more size increase via TSDs than any other ME types due to the largest insertions in number of HS-Alus. Despite having a low retrotransposition activity, LTRs did contribute ~750 kb size increase to the genome with 530 human-specific copies. It is also interesting to note that by ratio of size increase in relation to all MEs in a type, SVA showed the highest ratio among all (Table 2), seemingly attributed by the combination of a large average size of insertions, the highest ratio of transduction, and the highest ratio of HS-MEs.

Retrotransposition activity level of MEs during early human evolutionThe comprehensive list of HS-MEs provided us an opportunity to re-examine more accurately the activities of MEs in the human genome, especially during the earlier part of human evolution after separation from chimpanzees, which cannot be assessed using the polymorphic MEs. As shown in Supplementary Table S5, while many observations were similar to what we learned from prior studies based on younger polymorphic MEs.3,8,30,31 These include that (i) Alu, L1, SVA, and HERVs are the only four types of MEs with retrotransposition during human evolution and (ii) AluYa5 and AluYb8/9, L1HS, SVA_E/D, and HERV_K are the most active subfamilies for Alu, L1, SVA, and ERV, respectively. In addition, several notable differences were also observed. First, the ratio of HS-MEs in relation to all MEs in the most active subfamilies were much higher (10 times or more) than the corresponding ratios of polymorphic MEs8,31 (Supplementary Table S5). Second, a few active subfamilies not seen among polymorphic MEs were seen for HS-MEs, and these include AluYf, AluYk subfamilies, L1P4, L1M, SVA_A, and ERV1 subfamilies (Supplementary Table S5).3.6. Patterns of MEs and HS-MEs in the repetitive regions: SVAs are strongly biased for inserting into SVAsWith HS-MEs in repetitive regions available for the first time, we were interested in knowing whether there are any biases among MEs both as the sources and targets of retrotransposition insertions. We first examined the percentage of MEs inserting into other MEs for all MEs and for HS-MEs separately. For all MEs as the sources of insertions in MEs, there seems to be an increasing trend from LINEs (17.8%), DNA transposons (22.2%), LTRs (28.2%), SINEs (31.2%), and SVAs (36.5%) with the ratio of SVAs being more than doubled of that for LINEs (Supplementary Table S6a). When only HS-MEs were considered (Supplementary Table S6b), a similar trend (with DNA transposons absent as they were not included in this study) was seen, but the degree of difference among ME types is much smaller than for all MEs. Nevertheless, significant differences among ME types were still observed. For example, HS-Alus show the highest percentage inserted into MEs (46.5%), followed by HS-SVAs (40.7%), while HS-L1s and HS-LTRs have lower rates (35.5 and 35.3%) (Supplementary Table S6b).For each ME type as the insertion targets of HS-MEs, we calculated the frequency of HS-MEs as the number of HS-MEs per Mbp of host ME sequences (Supplementary Table S6c). Among the ME types as targets, the HS-ME density follows a decreasing trend from high to low among LINEs (7.3), DNA transposons (5.0), LTRs (4.0), and SINEs (1.8), seemly correlating with their overall age in the genome from old to new. However, very interestingly, SVA seems to be the striking outlier to this trend by having the highest density of HS-MEs (13.0) despite being the youngest ME type (Supplementary Table S6c). HS-Alus seem to be more frequently inserting into MEs than all other three ME types when all MEs are considered as targets seemly due to the highest number of HS-Alus. HS-Alus showed the highest ratio in LINEs, LTRs, and SINEs, but not for SVAs. Remarkably, HS-SVAs seem to show an unusually high preference for SVAs as targets at a frequency that is at least 18 times higher than the ratio of HS-SVAs into any other ME types (12.7 vs. 0.7 for LINE) (Supplementary Table S6c). In the meantime, HS-SVAs are also the most frequent seen HS-MEs in SVAs at a frequency that is more than 60 times higher than for other MEs (12.7 vs. 0.2 for HS-Alus and 0 for HS-L1s and HS-LTRs) (Supplementary Table S6c).3.7. Y chromosome is a hot target for HS-LTRsTo examine the distribution pattern of HS-MEs in the genome, we measured the HS-ME density (the number of HS-MEs per million base pairs of non-gaped chromosome sequences) and the ratio of HS-MEs among the same type of MEs in the chromosomes for each ME type or all types combined. As shown in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S7, with all types combined, the HS-ME density varies across chromosomes with Y chromosome showing the highest density (25.4 copies/Mbp), more than 5 times higher than the genome average (5 copies/Mbp). The pattern is different among the 4 ME types (Fig. 2). Both Alus and L1s showed a more or less homogenous density among autosomes. However, Y chromosome showed the highest density being four to five times higher than the genome average or more than 10 times higher than that of the chromosomes with the lowest density (Supplementary Table S7). SVAs showed relatively similar densities among autosomes, except for chromosome 19, which has a density of HS-SVA that is 2 times higher than the genome average. But for Y chromosome, opposite to what seen for HS-L1s and HS-Alus, the HS-SVA density is more than two times lower than the genome average. LTRs showed the most variable distribution among chromosomes, with very low densities for most chromosomes, but with high and extremely high density in chromosome 19, and Y, respectively. The HS-LTR density in Y chromosome (12.5 copies/2 Mbp) is more than 30 times higher than the genome average (0.4 copies /2 Mbp) (Supplementary Table S7 and Fig. S2). Therefore, Y chromosome seems to be a hot target for Alus, L1s, and LTRs with LTRs showing an extreme high preference over the rest of the genome, while it is the least preferred target for SVAs (Supplementary Fig. S2). Among other chromosomes, chromosome 19 stands out as having the highest density of MEs, genes, HS-SVAs, and HS-LTRs, while chromosome 22 seems to have the least HS-Alus, and HS-L1s. Correlation analysis showed a strong positive correlation of HS-SVA density with that of genes and with that of all MEs (R = 0.9 in both cases), while HS-L1s showed a moderate negative correlation with gene density (R = -0.4) (data not shown).

The pattern of TSD length and integration site sequence motifs for HS-MEsWe also surveyed TSD length and insertion site sequence motifs for HS-MEs, and compared among the four ME types. As in Fig. 3A, Alus, L1s, and SVAs showed an identical core sequence motif of ‘TT/AAAA’, confirming that all non-LTR retrotransposition use the same TPRT mechanisms.9,42,49,50 LTRs showed basically no recognizable motif signal, an observation not reported before despite reported having certain site preferences.51 For the pattern of TSD length, as shown in Fig. 3B, all three non-LTR ME types showed a more or less similar distribution pattern with the TSD length peaking at the 15 bp. However, minor differences in the detailed pattern of the length distribution are also noticeable. For example, SVAs had a narrower peak, while Alus showed a flatter peak covering 14–16 bp. Interestingly, L1s showed a secondary peak at 8 bp in addition to the main peak at 15 bp, while LTRs also showed a minor peak at 14 bp in addition to the dominant peak at 6 bp. These data clearly indicate the differences of the retrotransposition mechanisms used by LTR and non-LTR insertions, as well as some minor differences among different types of non-LTR insertions.

HS-MEs contribute to genes and regulatory elementsTo predict the functional impact of HS-MEs, we analysed the gene context of their insertion sites based the most updated version (release 23 July 2015) of gene annotation data from the GENCODE project46 combined with those in NCBI RefGene.47 As shown in Table 3, a total of 7,547 HS-MEs, representing more than half of all HS-MEs, are located in protein coding genes and non-coding RNAs as well as transcribed pseudogenes, representing a total of 4,607 unique genes/transcripts (data not shown). While the majority of these HS-MEs are located inside introns (Table 3), a significant number (304) also directly participated in the transcriptomes as part of exon regions of protein coding genes, non-coding RNAs, and transcribed pseudogenes. Collectively, these 304 HS-MEs contributed to a total of 84 kb sequence in the reference transcriptome, which totals in ~134 Mbp in length (Supplementary Table S8). Among those involved in the exons of protein-coding genes, 40 contribute to protein coding. In all these 40 cases, the HS-ME transcripts represent rare splice forms that have not been documented in the NCBI’s RefSeq genes, but reported in the GENCODE dataset, and interestingly SVAs contributed to 32 or 80% of these CDS HS-MEs (Supplementary Table S9). Distribution of human-specific mobile elements (HS-MEs) in genic regionsDistribution of human-specific mobile elements (HS-MEs) in genic regionsWe also examined the contribution of HS-MEs in regulatory elements, specifically the ENCODE ChIP-seq TFBS for 161 factors.52 Among the HS-MEs, 1,167 have sequence overlap with a total of 3,032 TFBS for 142 transcriptional factors (Supplementary Table S10). Interestingly, proportionally HS-LTRs showed the highest ratio (14.7%), followed by HS-SVAs (12.5%), which are much higher than that for LINEs (7.9%) and SINEs (6.6%), albert SINEs contribute to the largest number of TFBS (1,621), followed by LINEs (690), SVAs (504), and LTRs (217). Our data suggest that these young HS-MEs have started making their ways in participating in transcriptome, protein coding, and regulation of splicing and transcription.3.10. Deposition and access of the HS-ME dataWe deposited the HS-ME data into the dbRIP database (htpp://dbrip.org) under a study ID of 2018-01 (available for hg19). In dbRIP, the HS-MEs can be visualized in the same as the polymorphic MEs, i.e. in the UCSC genome browser along with other available data tracks or in detailed data page. HS-MEs were distinguished from polymorphic MEs in the dbRIP with a letter ‘h’ at the end of the ID. The HS-ME data (for hg38) in fasta format with the sequences organized into left flanking (400 bp), TSD1, ME insertion, TSD2, and right flanking (400 bp) and all other related information provided in the definition lines are available for downloading from the dbRIP data download page. The HS-ME data are also made available along with the polymorphic MEs data via Track Hub (dbRIP) at the UCSC genome browser site at http://genome.ucsc.edu.4. DiscussionsIn this study, we aimed to provide a comprehensive compilation of MEs that are uniquely present in the human genomes. This is necessary resource for a comprehensive assessment of the MEs’ impacts on human biology. By taking the advantages of the much-improved reference genome sequences for humans and the closely related non-human primates and by tackling the MEs inside repetitive sequences and utilizing a more robust multi-way comparative genomics strategy, we were able to identify a total of 14,870 HS-MEs. Among HS-MEs, more than half (8,049) were reported as HS-MEs for the first time, thus representing a significant improvement. Such a comprehensive list of HS-MEs provides unique opportunities in examining the pattern and trend of retrotransposition during human genome evolution since the divergence from chimpanzee and gaining new insights regarding the roles of MEs in human evolution.4.1. Challenges in identifying HS-MEsAs shown in Supplementary Table S1, the number of MEs annotated in the human reference genome increased significantly in the most recent version (GRC38, December 2013) compared with an earlier version released in 2004 (GRC35, UCSC hg17),53 which covered the first major updates since the initial publication of the human draft genome in 2001.1 MEs increased ~289,000 in number and ~140 Mb in sequence, leading to the increase of ME percentage in the human genome from 48.8% in GRC35 to 52.1% in GRC38 (based on non-gap sequences). The larger increase among ME type is for LTRs (~34,000 in number and ~16.5 Mbp in size. L1s had an increase of 42,000 in number and 21.8 Mbp in size. The increase for Alus is ~12,300 in number and ~675 kb in size (Supplementary Table S1).Despite constant improvements in the quality of the reference genome sequences for human and other primates and of the related bioinformatics tools, obtaining a precise list of MEs uniquely present in the human genomes remains difficult with many challenges. Several factors contribute to the complications in this task, and these include but are not limited to: (i) incomplete coverage of the reference genome sequences for human and more so for other primates as exemplified in a few recent publications related to human and other primates36,54; (ii) assembly errors, particularly in regions rich of MEs; (iii) genome rearrangements occurring in a lineage- and species-specific fashion, often involving or mediated by MEs17–20; (iv) mis-annotation of MEs.Prior similar studies on HS-MEs, best represented by Mills et al.,30 were limited by all these factors as well as by the limitation of methodologies and study scope that either focused on a specific type of MEs or part of the genome.8,33,55,56 Most of the MEs in the repetitive regions, including these in the ME-rich regions, were excluded from all previous studies.4.2. Improvements for identification of HS-MEsIn our study, we tried to address most of the issues mentioned above. In addition to the use of the best available reference genome sequences for human and other primates, we took an unbiased approach to cover all annotated MEs in the human reference genome, thus representing the first study to include MEs in the repetitive regions, particularly those within the ME-rich regions. This has contributed to 3,744 HS-MEs or 47% of the 8,049 novel HS-MEs (Supplementary Table S4b). Furthermore, the process of integrating MEs in the original RepeatMasker provided a more accurate counting of the transposition events represented by the MEs in the human genome and locations of their flanking sequences. The former leads to more accurate DNA transposition rate, while the latter is critical for identifying HS-MEs and characterizing their sequences including the TSDs. As shown in Supplementary Table S1, the fragmentation affects a significant proportion of MEs (as high as ~60% in L1s) with the rates seemly to be positively correlated with the element length and relative ages (data not shown). The integration led to the identification of 998 HS-MEs that would not have been identified otherwise, and this has in part contributed to the higher ratio of novel HS-MEs for LTRs and L1s than SVAs and Alus (Supplementary Table S4b). LTRs and L1s are much longer in average than SVAs and Alus, so they have a high chance of being interrupted by genomic rearrangement events, while full-length LTRs were also reported arbitrarily as three entries by RepeatMasker. The use of multiple non-human primate genomes not only helped reduce the false positive by providing orthologous sequences for gaps or regions of rearrangements in the chimpanzee genome, but also helped increase the sensitivity via contributing to 822 novel HS-MEs (Supplementary Table S4a).The use of two sequence alignment tools, blat and liftOver, in identifying the orthologous sequences also helped reduce the false positives that can be caused by many of the aforementioned complicating factors. LiftOver uses alignment data linking closely related genomes through blastz,57 which focuses on large-scale synteny conservation, and is basically the strategy used in the previous analysis of human- and chimp-specific MEs by Mills et al.30 The method may work well for well conserved regions, but usually performs poorly for regions involving local rearrangements or with high density of repetitive sequences or misplacement of contigs during assembly. Therefore, it may miss to detect the presence of orthologous MEs and generate high false positives, most likely as category II HS-MEs (missing orthologous flanking regions). In contrast, the blat method focuses on identifying local alignments and performs better in handling regions with species-specific sequence changes near MEs. But it may miss some true HS-MEs by generating some false positive detection of orthologous MEs due to non-orthologous sequence similarity. Therefore, by requiring support of both methods for calling an HS-ME status, we were able to achieve a minimal level of false positive rate in HS-ME detection with an estimated sensitivity and specificity of 95.4 and 97%, respectively. We would like to believe that our current list of HS-MEs may still represent an underestimate of all HS-MEs that may exist in the human genomes due to many complications associated with ME analysis and our emphasis on reducing the false positives. Notably, our list does not cover the processed pseudogenes, which represent copies of mRNAs that were copied back into the genome as a side-product of L1-based transposition,58,59 and the human-specific processed pseudogenes are likely to be in the order of hundreds based on the level of detected polymorphic levels.60,614.3. The pattern of HS-MEs in MEsMEs in repetitive regions have been mostly ignored by prior studies since it is much more difficult to analyse than those inserted into unique genomic regions. Not only the repetitive regions are more prone to sequence assembly errors, it is also more challenging for computational analysis aiming at specifies-specific and polymorphic ME entries. In a sense, the ignorance of these MEs may be justified for locating in regions assumed to be ‘less functionally important’. However, this may not be true, and by ignoring them, we might be missing useful information. In this study, by taking an unbiased approached, we identified more than 3,700 HS-MEs in the ME regions, which count for approximately a quarter of all HS-MEs. These MEs allowed us to observe some interesting patterns regarding the trend of DNA transposition in the human genome and the different behaviours of different ME types.When all MEs were considered, the rates of MEs that inserted inside MEs by ME type showed an increasing trend in the order of L1, DNA, LTR, SINE, and SVA (Supplementary Table S6a). We think these differential ratios reflect the relative overall ages of these ME types with the older groups (e.g. LINEs) having less MEs than the younger groups (e.g. SVAs) in the genome as the targets for insertions.In comparison, the ratios of HS-MEs in MEs are more or less similar and lack a clear trend among the ME types ranging from ~35% for both L1 and LTR to ~46% for Alu and ~41% for SVA (Supplementary Table S6b). This is expected since HS-MEs from all types share approximately the same time span in the human genome and thus they had the same amount of MEs as insertion targets. The differences we see here with HS-MEs may represent a more accurate reflection of the preferences for insertions into MEs among ME types. In other words, Alus are more likely to insert to MEs than L1s, LTRs, and SVAs.An unusual observation was made when we examined each ME type as the targets of HS-ME insertion individually (Supplementary Table S6c). Here we examined the preference of each HS-ME type for each type of MEs as the targets. By the density of HS-MEs, L1, LTR, and Alu all showed a more or less consistent decreasing trend for inserting into LINEs, DNA transposons, LTRs, SINEs, and SVAs, seemly correlating with their overall age in the genome from old to new. This is expected as older MEs have more chance to be inserted by later MEs. For HS-SVAs, while the trend seems to be the same among LINEs, DNAs, LTRs, and SINEs as the targets, they showed a density in SVAs that is more than 120, 40, 30, 16 times higher than that in SINEs, LTRs, DNAs and LINEs, respectively (Supplementary Table S6c). Furthermore, SVAs have the highest density of HS-MEs among the ME types and with over 98% of HE-MEs in SVAs being SVAs and the rest 2% being Alus. This extreme bias of HS-SVAs for SVAs and vice versa is remarkable since SVAs are the youngest ME type in the human genome, and by random chance we would expect to see the lowest ratio of HS-MEs in SVAs. In fact, very few or no insertion of HS-MEs from L1s, LTRs, and Alus were seen in SVAs. The reason for this extremely strong preference for SVAs inserting into SVAs and its functional implication are to be investigated in future studies.4.4. The retrotransposition activity level during early human evolutionIn the last decade, we and others have extensively studied the profiles of active MEs and their relative retrotransposition levels in the human genome based on analysis of polymorphic MEs.8,31,32,34,42–44,56,62–66 These studies show that L1s, Alus, SVAs, and HERV-K are ME types remaining ongoing retrotransposition activity. The most active subfamilies for each ME type have also been established. It is worth to point out that these data reflect the retrotransposition profiles in the most recent phase of modern human evolution, during which humans migrates and established as distinct populations, and the rate of retrotransposition in this period might not necessarily be the same as for the earlier part of human evolution. The availability of a comprehensive list of HS-MEs in relation to chimpanzee and other non-human primates can be used to fill this gap.As expected, our data confirmed the active retrotransposon subfamilies identified by prior studies, including, Ya5 and Yb8/9 for Alus, L1HS for L1s, the F-subfamily for SVAs, and HERV-K for LTR retrotransposons (Supplementary Table S5). In the meantime, notable differences were also observed. First, the ratios of HS-MEs in relation to all MEs in the same subfamilies are much higher than that for polymorphic MEs. Second, many extra active subfamilies were observed, and these include the AluYf and AluYk subfamilies among Alus, the L1P4 and L1M subfamilies for L1s, SVA_A subfamily, and ERV1 subfamily for LTR retrotransposons (Supplementary Table S5). While the higher ratios of HS-MEs compared with that of polymorphic MEs in each active subfamily may be explained merely by the longer time span covered by HS-MEs, the presence of the extra active subfamilies not seen based on polymorphic MEs might be a result of the longer time-span for HS-MEs and the dropping retrotransposition activity in the modern human genomes.4.5. Y chromosome as a hot target for HS-LTRsAs shown in Supplementary Table S7, Fig. S2, and Fig. 2, the HS-ME density on Y chromosome is significantly higher than all other chromosomes. By ME type, HS-MEs from Alus, L1s, and LTRs all showed a higher density for Y chromosome. For Alus and L1s, the HS-ME density in Y chromosome is at least 4 times higher than the genome average, while for HS-LTRs, the density in Y chromosome is more than 30 times higher than the genome average. In contrary, HS-SVAs showed a strong bias against Y chromosome with the density being only ~35% of the genome average. This differential bias for Y chromosome among different types of HS-MEs cannot be a result of artefacts, such as poorer sequence quality or lack of Y-chromosome-specific sequences for other primates, as such factors would lead to the same trend of bias for all ME types. It does not seem to be explainable by the gene density either, since chromosome 13 has a lower gene density than Y chromosome, but its HS-ME densities for all 4 types of HS-MEs do not show a strong deviation from the genome average (Supplementary Table S7). The extreme contrast between the densities of SVAs and LTRs for Y chromosome as well as the differences between Y chromosome and all other chromosomes for the density of all HS-MEs are well visualized in the genome plots of HS-MEs shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. The high preference for Y chromosome by HS-MEs for Alus and L1s may be partially explained by the lack of homologous recombination-based deletion and lack of selection pressure and relative longer time in male germline.67,68 However, we cannot explain the extreme strong positive bias for HS-LTRs and negative bias for HS-SVAs. Therefore, the exact reason behind the significant differential bias for different types of HS-MEs in Y chromosome is unknown, and so is the impact of such biases. Nevertheless, our observation does seem to support a recent notion that remodelling and regeneration have dominated chimpanzee and human male specific chromosome evolution, while genetic decay seems to be a general trend in the evolution of Y chromosomes.45 In addressing the recent heated debate among the science community about whether chromosome Y is disappearing,69 our result seems to hint that Y chromosome is certainly not disappearing for human and HS-MEs may have contributed to the observed fast evolving pattern on Y chromosome after the human and chimpanzee divergence.454.6. The impact of MEs on human genome size and gene functionThe 14,870 HS-MEs collectively contributed a net increase of the genome size by 14.2 Mbp since LCA with chimpanzee (Table 2). This size of genome increase is close to one-quarter of the Y chromosome and is larger than the genomes of free-living eukaryotic organisms, such as yeast.70 This size increase is significant for the relative short period of time and by a single molecular mechanism, and it may represent only well-defined significant change in the human genome during human evolution. The only other molecular mechanism that could contribute a significant size change to the human genome would be genomic segmental duplication.71 However, no data are available about the exact amount of human-specific segmental duplications occurred for the same period of human evolution.We attempted to assess the overall functional impact of these HS-MEs on genes by examining their location in the genome in relation to known genes and functional regulatory elements. A total of 7,547 or 50.7% of these HS-MEs are located inside or in the 1 kb promoter regions of genes for protein coding, non-coding RNAs, as well as transcribed pseudogenes (Table 3), which represent 4,607 unique genes/transcripts (data not shown). Among these, 240 HS-MEs are part of transcripts, representing mostly alternative splice forms. Interestingly, in 40 of these cases, an HS-ME contributes to part of the coding region in the transcript, albeit all of these transcripts represent rare splice forms documented the GENCODE, but are not yet included in NCBI Ref Gene list (Supplementary Table S9). A profound observation here is that 80% of these CDS HS-MEs are contributed by SVAs, which represent the youngest and most active group of MEs in the human genome.10,31 This pattern seems to hold true when all MEs were included in the analysis of MEs’ contribution to human transcriptome (Joshi et al., manuscript in preparation). These data suggest to us that SVAs as the youngest and most active group of MEs in the human genome might have played a significant role in past human evolution and have the highest potential among all ME types in impacting future human genome evolution.Outside of the promote and exon regions, 1,167 of the HS-MEs contribute to 3,032 binding sites for 142 of the 161 examined transcriptional factors (Supplementary Table S10). While their specific functional impact would be hard to predict computationally and can only be more accurately assessed/validated experimentally, many examples of such functional impact have been demonstrated.14,21In summary, our data suggest that, despite being very young in the genome, many of these HS-MEs have already participated in gene function via regulation of transcription, splicing, and protein coding, and there may be more potentials for their future participation as demonstrated by Ward et al.264.7. Future directionsDue to the technical challenges associated with the analysis of MEs and deficiencies of the reference genome sequences for human and other primates, our list of HS-MEs still suffers a certain level of false negatives and false positives. We can expect that the number of HS-MEs continue to increase from regions with sequencing gaps, especially regions highly rich of repetitive sequences, such as the centromere and telomere regions, which may be hot spots for certain types of ME insertion, such as LTRs.72 A good proportion of the HS-MEs would be shared by other archaic human species/subspecies, notably the Neanderthals and Denisovans.73–75 Once high quality genome sequences become available for these genomes, we can further break down the human evolution into more phases and examine and compare the DNA transposition profiles among these periods.76 It would be interesting to find out see how many of these HS-MEs are truly unique to Homo sapiens. Furthermore, a certain portion of the HS-MEs are polymorphic, and it should be useful to generate a list of HS-MEs common to all humans (minimal set of HS-MEs) and another list of HS-MEs that are polymorphic (including also those outside of the reference genome). The former would be useful for analysing MEs’ impact on evolution of all modern humans, while the latter would be useful for studying MEs’ contribution to genetic and phenotypic diversity among human populations and individuals. Additionally, we are extending similar analysis to all other primate genomes, for which genome sequences are available, to access the impact of retrotransposition on primate evolution (work in progress).This work is in part supported by grants from the Canadian Research Chair program, Canadian Foundation of Innovation, Ontario Ministry of Research and Innovation, Canadian Natural Science and Engineering Research Council (NSERC), and Brock University to PL, and was made possible by Compute Canada/SHARCNET high performance computing facilities.Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary data"

Our results highlight the value of a detailed probe screening on a preliminary genome assembly to produce reliable data for downstream genetic studies. This work should inspire and assist the development of similar genomic resources for other orphan crops and forest trees with highly heterozygous genomes.1. IntroductionThe remarkable advances in whole-genome sequencing (WGS) and genome-wide genotyping technologies have provided unprecedented opportunities to gain detailed insights into the overall patterns of genetic variation underpinning the basis of adaptive evolution.1–4 Such advances took place first in species for which reference genome sequences and high-throughput single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) genotyping were readily available, including humans5 and model plant species.6,7 However, little advance has taken place for the vast majority of plant species besides the mainstream crops,8 some minor ones9 and the main plantation forest trees.10The dropping costs and increasing data yields of next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies have fostered the development of several sequencing-based genotyping methods that allow for simultaneous discovery and genotyping of very large numbers of markers.11 Among these methods, targeted enrichment or sequence capture12 has been increasingly used in a large array of organisms.13 Early reports published in humans14,15 and in plants such as maize,16 eucalypts,17 poplars18 and pines19 showed the potential of the capture systems to assay sequence variants across the genomes. Sequence capture can significantly reduce costs in comparison to WGS because only specific loci of interest are sequenced at high coverage, increasing confidence of true variant detection. The practical advantages and increasing accessibility of target sequence capture methods have been reviewed in the context of evolutionary and ecological genomics, predicting a rapid expansion of this approach.20 For example, targeted enrichment was recently used to increase phylogenetic resolution within the Neotropical tree genus Inga (Leguminosae),21 generating alignments of over 0.3 Mbp of coding sequences revealing nearly 5,000 informative sites. Although providing large volumes of phylogenetically informative sequence data, analyses indicated that to further enhance understanding of the evolution of Inga, for instance by increasing ability to discriminate among more parameter-rich models and more recent divergence histories, a much larger set of sites, covering several thousand loci, would be needed.Handroanthus impetiginosus (Mart. ex DC.) Mattos (syn. Tabebuia impetiginosa, Bignoniaceae) commonly known as Pink Ipê or Lapacho tree, is a Neotropical hardwood widely distributed in seasonally dry tropical forests (SDTFs) of South America and Mesoamerica.22,23 Our previous studies with H. impetiginosus populations in Central Brazil have revealed incomplete lineage sorting and a highly structured genetic diversity,23 representing an excellent system to better understand evolutionary processes that result in correlation between ecological and genetic differentiation in tropical biomes. We are now interested in disentangle the uncertainty in relating phylogenetic inference of ancestral geography and genealogical histories of individual loci in H. impetiginosus. Attempts to reconstruct species phylogeny using gene sequences has shown to be affected by the number of loci used to estimate the phylogeny and the number of individuals sampled per species.24 The availability of a high-throughput genotyping system at large numbers of loci in a reasonable number of individuals can provide, despite the presence of retention and sorting of ancestral polymorphism, clues on the occurrence of past contacts that may have facilitated evolutionary divergence of modern population sub-groups. From a practical standpoint, an improved knowledge of the evolutionary history and population genomics of this highly exploited species may also aid the precise identification of geographical origin of timber trade in forensic applications to combat the significant illegal trading pressure25 and help define management units for conservation planning.26We have recently generated a preliminary genome assembly and annotation of the nuclear genome sequence of a single individual of H. impetiginosus.27 Using these resources as reference, in this work we designed and carried out an evaluation of a set of 30,795 sequence capture probes for the identification and genotyping of nearly 200,000 SNPs located inside circa of 14,000 annotated protein-coding genes or in close proximity to them to support multiple sequence-based genetic analyses in the species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Biological material and sequencingTotal genomic DNA samples from six unrelated trees of H. impetiginosus were extracted using the Qiagen DNeasy Plant Min kit (Qiagen, DK) and pooled in equimolar amounts to be whole-genome sequenced. These six trees used in the pooled WGS were part of the 24 trees later used for the sequence capture system. They were sampled at the rate of one per each population group in an attempt to sample a representative sequence diversity of the species for designing probes. One barcoded DNA library was built on the pooled sample and paired-end sequencing of this library (2 × 150 nt) was performed in half lane of an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument (Illumina, CA, USA) at the High-Throughput Sequencing and Genotyping Center of the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, USA. DNA samples of 24 H. impetiginosus individual haplotypes sampled from six subpopulations spanning a wide geographic range of the species (Supplementary Table S1) were used for the development and evaluation of the sequence capture system.2.2. Sequence-capture probe designTwo different sets of probe sequences were designed. The first one targeted transcript sequences of protein-coding genes predicted from the genome assembly of H. impetiginosus UFG-1.27 These probes were designed by RAPiD Genomics LLC, Gainesville, FL, USA, from a total of 17,424 transcript sequences, which were tiled with 26,526 120-mer DNA sequence probes. The second set, designed by our group, sampled SNPs identified in pooled low coverage WGS data. We used nearly 20 Gbp of data (70,049,993 pairs of reads) for the SNP calling process. From the empirically determined haploid genome size of 557 Mbp/1C for H. impetiginosus,27 this read set corresponded to nearly 3× of sequencing coverage in the pool of 12 chromosomes. Based on the 23,508 variants derived from the GATK28 and the 9,079 from the Cortex29 analysis, the genome assembly of the species was used as a template for the design of 120-mer probes surrounding the SNP vicinity. A total of 4,269 120-mer DNA probe sequences were extracted from the template genome for subsequent use. The 4,269 WGS derived probes together with the 26,526 probes from transcript data, composed the capture system with a total of 30,795 probes. Additional details on the design of these probes are described in Supplementary File S1.2.3. Sequence-capture data generationRapid Genomics LLC (Gainesville, FL, USA) Capture-Seq method provided target DNA enrichment across this custom probe set on the 24 individuals using an 8-plex capture pool.19 The products of multiplexed reactions were sequenced in a single lane of an Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument, 1 × 101 bp.2.4. Analyses of sequence capture data and definition of target lociSequencing reads were trimmed for adapters and aligned to a genome sequence assembly of H. impetiginosus27 with BWA30 version 0.5.9 using BWA-backtrack algorithm, default settings. These steps were performed in a grid computing cluster software system using a pipeline available from the International Cassava Genetic Map Consortium.31 Preliminary analysis of variants was performed by joint-sample SNV calling and genotyping of the 24 individuals using GATK-GenotypeGVCFs method on gVCF files produced by HaplotypeCaller on each sample (options: -mbq 10 -mmq 10 -hets 0.01 -ERC GVCF -ploidy 2). For the resulting VCF file, the raw SNPs were analyzed. Coordinates of the 30,795 sequence probes on the genome were reputable initially as ‘on-target’ regions, while all the complementary intervals on the genome assembly were considered ‘off-target’. Following the preliminary analysis of on-target and off-target variants, sequence coordinates for the probes passing preliminary quality control were adjusted to include 200 bp in each direction. All book-ended (‘touching’) entries were then merged into a single interval using, respectively, slopBed and mergeBed utilities from the BedTools v2.25 package.32 A set of non-overlapping intervals thereafter called loci was defined. This criterion was set to reduce the negative impact of unintended sequence capture while allowing for accurate variant detection in genomic regions contiguous to the region of interest thus extending the utility of the targeted sequencing to novel genomic sequences that would be more divergent from the probe sequence. It also allowed the identification of faulty or improper probe sequences in our initial design. Based on this criterion, the coordinates of the 30,795 probe sequences have determined 23,232 distinct target loci across the genome assembly. These encompass 19,962 loci determined by the coordinates of probe sequences from transcripts and 3,270 loci for the low-coverage WGS. For the assessment of the capture efficiency, only the defined loci were considered as callable regions for on-target SNP discovery and further genotyping, while calls outside these regions were discarded. Sequencing coverage and capture efficiency for loci determined by probe coordinates from transcripts and low-coverage WGS were computed per sample. Coverage was quoted as the ratio of the aligned read depth, which denotes the number of quality reads after alignment to the genome assembly, to the number of sequenced loci in the corresponding sample. Capture efficiency was estimated as the ratio of the number of loci for which at least one quality SNP was detected to the total number of loci. Finally, following GATK best practices and other recommendations to improve variant calling in NGS data,33 we devised a procedure to establish useful quality dataset for further refinement of the SNP calls in the defined target loci as described in the Supplementary File S1.2.5. Performance of the initially designed probe sequences for target enrichment and captureBioinformatics filtering steps were developed to obtain quality SNP data across the defined 23,232 loci. The successive application of these filters led us to define call sets that encompassed a collection of variant calls across loci and probe sequences with increasing stringency, which were named STANDARD, GQ20+VQSR and GQ20+VQSR+MM80 (see Results for definitions). To detect improper designed or faulty probes for reliable SNP detection, capture efficiencies across these call sets were inspected by counting the number of probe sequences across target loci for which at least one quality SNP was detected. A success rate for probes was obtained by dividing the number of successful probes by their totals in the initial design, i.e. 30,795, whether the source of design were transcripts (26,526 probes) or low-coverage WGS (4,269 probes). Conversely, a failure rate was defined as (1 - success rate). The Success/Failure rate was also stratified according the probe location in the genome assembly for predicted gene model features or intergenic region.2.6. Reproducibility of the capture assayReproducibility was assessed in terms of SNP recall rate and precision between technical replicates conducted in the same laboratory. Reproducibility was assessed for a partial set of 14,135 sequence capture probes selected out of the 30,795 probes (23,232 loci). The coordinates of these 14,135 probe sequences fell within 11,026 loci on the genome assembly. Nearly 50% (5,978 out of 11,026) of these loci were randomly selected in the well-curated GQ20+VQSR set of probes. It included 6,843 probe sequences from transcripts and 1,313 probes from low-coverage WGS. The remaining 5,048 loci (3,023 probe sequences from transcripts and 2,956 from low-coverage WGS) were taken randomly from the remaining set of loci. For an adequate reproducibility assay, the same level of DNA pooling for the capture assay, i.e. 8 samples per pool, and sequencing effort, i.e. 24 barcoded samples in one lane of a HiSeq2000 instrument, were kept between replicates. The sequence data in the first assay (called HIMP-1 thereafter) and the second partial replicate (called HIMP-2 thereafter) were processed using the analytical protocol developed in this study, including variant recalibration using a database of likelihoods for markers in the HIMP-1 study. VCF files for the two assays were combined and evaluated as described in Supplementary File S1.2.7. Genomic variant characterizationWe combined the sequence data in HIMP-1 and HIMP-2 capture assays and used our pipeline to compile a catalog of SNPs across the genome assembly. SnpEff34 version 4.3t was used to annotate variants in the genome assembly based on their targeted regions and predicted coding effects. As a first glimpse of the ability of this sequence capture system to carry out population genomics studies of H. impetiginosus, we used the SNPs data to look at the site frequency spectrum (SFS) and some population genetics features. To account for the fact that the sequence capture system provides data in ‘blocks’, with SNPs likely in complete linkage disequilibrium (LD), we used Plink v1.90b2h35 to greedily prune SNPs. A window size of variant count was used such that no SNP pairs remained with r2 greater than a threshold for tight LD (–indep-pairwise 50 5 0.5), and only included SNPs for which missing data was =20% (–geno 0.2). We used the data of the LD-pruned SNPs to obtain estimates of population heterozygosity, the ratio of transitions and transversion (Ts/Tv) and the number of SNP with heterozygous or non-reference homozygous genotypes (het/non-ref-hom).3. ResultsTo facilitate following the sequence of methods and results obtained along the development and evaluation of the sequence capture system, a comprehensive flowchart is presented (Fig. 1). The overall process involved five steps, starting with the sequence probe design, all the way to the definition of a set of loci (non-overlapping intervals), recognition of improper or faulty probes, and genome annotation of the sampled SNPs. Each step is detailed in its components such that one may follow the numbers of input sequences, probes or SNPs, and the resulting output numbers achieved.

Sequence capture dataA total of 156,896, 801 single-end reads were generated from sequencing of DNA fragments captured by the 30,795 probes in the sample of 24 individuals of H. impetiginosus (mean: 6,537,367; sd: 2,865,856) (Supplementary Table S2). Alignment of the reads to the genome assembly was determined for each sample. We observed a varying fraction of unmapped reads which ranged from 10% to nearly 40% for some individuals. For mapped reads, mappability within targeted regions was further evaluated using HCMappingQualityFilter in GATK HaplotypeCaller (-mmq 10, default value). Overall good read mappability was achieved, with only 3–4% of the reads being discarded prior to variant calling.3.2. Preliminary analyses of SNPs and definition of target lociA total of 251,169 SNPs were located in the genomic intervals of the 30,795 probe coordinates (‘on-target variants’). We identified a set of targeted regions that consistently produced data in the sampled individuals. For three samples the sequencing coverage was <40× (Supplementary Table S2). With the exclusion of these samples, a total of 26,451 probe sequences successfully captured on-target SNPs. In our evaluation of off-target variants (see Supplementary File S1), we found that additional 134,126 quality SNPs were spread across the genome assembly in regions up to 25 kbp from the closest targeted location (Fig. 2). These distances were unevenly distributed and most of them (75% of the total off-target SNPs) were only 200 bp upstream or downstream to the targeted location on the genome assembly. Sequence coordinates for these 26,451 probes passing the preliminary analyses were adjusted then to include 200 bp in each direction (see Materials and Methods). A set of 19,627 capturable loci was thus defined (average length: 607 bp; median length: 520 bp) and none of them had matches to annotated coordinates to repeats in the genome assembly of H. impetiginosus. Consequently, 4,344 probe sequences (~14% of 30,795) were considered improper in the design of the capture system. Distribution of off-target SNPs distances to the closest probe sequence coordinate. (A) The narrow spectrum of distances indicates that most of the identified SNPs are located up to 200 bp upstream or downstream to a targeted location in the genome.

Improvement procedure for SNP calling and genotyping refinementWe applied a bioinformatics protocol for SNP discovery and progressive filtering of low-confidence variants across the 26,451 120-mer sequences and the 19,627 targeted loci defined across this probe set. Overall, the numbers of aligned reads were 63,868,629 (~41% of the total reads) and 107,275,224 (~60% of the total reads) across probe and loci coordinates, respectively. The average sequencing coverage and standard deviation for the samples across the loci was 136x ± 75x (9x - 304x). Sequencing coverage and capture efficiency for loci determined by probe coordinates from transcripts and low-coverage WGS were estimated per sample (Table 1). Considering the samples with capture efficiency greater than 60%, the coverage was equal or greater than 70x. This coverage is enough to produce accurate joint genotype calls for common variants across the samples (minimum allele frequency, MAF > 5%) using per-sample read depth as low as 3 (70x0.05) at the variant site. The call set across these target loci resulted in 688,754 SNPs. It was named ‘STANDARD’ and its main features are shown in Table 2. Summary of per sample coverage and capture efficiency over the 23,232 target loci in the genome assembly of H. impetiginosusCoverage is the ratio of the aligned read depth, which denotes the number of quality reads after alignment to the genome assembly, to the number of sequenced loci in the corresponding sample.Denotes the number of target loci in the initial design of the capture system for which at least one quality read was detected after alignment to the genome assembly.Capture efficiency was computed at sample level by the ratio between the number of loci for which at least one quality SNP was detected using the improvement procedure for SNP calling and genotyping refinement and the total number of loci determined by probes in the corresponding design: 19,962 loci from transcripts of protein-coding genes (c(a)); 3,270 loci from low-coverage WGS (c(b)); total of 23,232 loci (c(c)).Summary of per sample coverage and capture efficiency over the 23,232 target loci in the genome assembly of H. impetiginosusCoverage is the ratio of the aligned read depth, which denotes the number of quality reads after alignment to the genome assembly, to the number of sequenced loci in the corresponding sample.Denotes the number of target loci in the initial design of the capture system for which at least one quality read was detected after alignment to the genome assembly.Capture efficiency was computed at sample level by the ratio between the number of loci for which at least one quality SNP was detected using the improvement procedure for SNP calling and genotyping refinement and the total number of loci determined by probes in the corresponding design: 19,962 loci from transcripts of protein-coding genes (c(a)); 3,270 loci from low-coverage WGS (c(b)); total of 23,232 loci (c(c)).Summary of the numbers of loci, size in base pairs (bp), numbers of probes, SNPs, gene models and intergenic regions retained following each filtering step in the variant analysis using the GATK frameworkSee Results for the definitions of the SNP call sets.Summary of the numbers of loci, size in base pairs (bp), numbers of probes, SNPs, gene models and intergenic regions retained following each filtering step in the variant analysis using the GATK frameworkSee Results for the definitions of the SNP call sets.Additional filtering based on SNP quality score recalibration using a custom database of likelihoods and genotyping refinement steps (see Supplementary File S1) resulted in a set of 352,879 SNPs (51.2% of the variants in the STANDARD call set). Coordinates of these SNPs were within 18,216 targeted loci (˜11 Mbp), encompassing the locations of 24,771 probe sequences (Supplementary File S2). This call set was named ‘GQ20+VQSR’ (Table 2). With this improvement procedure, an additional set of 1,680 probe sequences were deemed faulty for SNP detection. Together with the preliminary analysis, this additional step to detect faulty probes resulted in the exclusion of 6,024 (4,344 + 1,680) probes. It represents ~20% of the probes in the initial design. Based on our assessment of genetic diversity from the sequence data, using average <U+03B8> (the population mutation rate) of 0.009 (Supplementary Table S7), and sample size (N = 21 diploid individuals), we found that the number of quality SNPs closely matches the expectation of ~367,000 polymorphic sites using the Watterson estimator36 (=18,216 × 520 × 0,009 × 4.3), where 4.3 is the partial sum of the harmonic series with (2*N – 1) terms. Finally, we applied a threshold of less than 20% of missing data for any site on the former ‘GQ20+VQSR’ call set. Considering the 21 individuals, the number of retained polymorphic SNPs dropped from 352,879 to 83,476, within 11,748 loci (~65% of 18,216). This call set resulting from all three filters applied was named ‘GQ20+VQSR+MM80’ (Table 2).3.4. Efficiency of the capture systemTo assess the efficiency of the system to detect genomic variants, we considered the initial number of 30,795 probe sequences and 23,232 distinct target loci. The number of loci targeted by probes in which we successful detected quality SNPs ranged from 11,748 (50.6% of 23,232) to 18,216 (78.4% of 23,232) across quality detected variants, whether we accounted for polymorphism (MAF > 5%) and low-missing data at the genotype level (<20%) or only polymorphism requirement, respectively. Table 3 summarizes the capture efficiencies for probes across the progressively filtered call sets whether the source of design were transcripts or low-coverage WGS and considering the location of the probes in the genome assembly. Performance of the initially designed probe sequences for target enrichment and captureCapture efficiencies across filtered call sets (see Results for the definitions of the filter criteria) were inspected by counting the number of loci and probe sequences for which at least one quality SNP was detected. A success rate was obtained by dividing the number of successful probes by their totals in the initial design, i.e. 30,795 probe sequences, whether the source of design were mRNA (26,526 probes) or low-coverage WGS (4,269 probes). Conversely, a failure rate was defined as (1 - success rate). The Success/Failure rate was also stratified according the probe location in the genome assembly for predicted gene model features or intergenic region.Performance of the initially designed probe sequences for target enrichment and captureCapture efficiencies across filtered call sets (see Results for the definitions of the filter criteria) were inspected by counting the number of loci and probe sequences for which at least one quality SNP was detected.

Conversely, a failure rate was defined as (1 - success rate). The Success/Failure rate was also stratified according the probe location in the genome assembly for predicted gene model features or intergenic region.3.5. Technical reproducibility and the performance of the sequence capture system for genotypingSequence data generated in the partially replicated assay, named HIMP-2, produced 105,665,340 reads in total. Considering the sequencing intervals defined by the 14,135 probe sequences and 11,026 loci in this second assay (see Materials and Methods), 52,717,622 reads (~50% of the total reads) and 75,394,548 reads (~71% of the total reads) were aligned across on-target regions, respectively. After SNP detection using the improvement procedure for variant analysis, the VCF files contained records of 129,423 SNPs in HIMP-1 and a total of 175,361 in HIMP-2. The overall sensitivity—the fraction of ‘true called SNPs’ to ‘true SNPs’—was 61% while the precision—the fraction of ‘true called SNPs’ to ‘called SNPs’—was 83%. False positive (FP) rate, calculated as the FP/(FP + TN) ratio (TN is the true negative rate), was 8% while the overall accuracy was 81%. Contingency table values were summarized (Supplementary Table S3). The true positive (TP) set of SNPs consisted of 93,441 variants with high confidence to the genotype calls between replicates (see Supplementary File S1 and Table S4).For the 14,135 probe sequences and 11,026 loci (47.5% of the 23,232 total targeted loci) evaluated across replicates, the overall performance of the capture system was 84% (8,315 out of 9,866) for the transcript-based probes and only 12% (524 out of 4,269) for the WGS-designed probes. Taking into account only the well-curated set of probes (GQ20+VQSR), the efficiency between replicates for transcript-based probes was 6,651 out of 6,843 (97%) and 430 out of 1,313 (33%) for probes from low-coverage WGS. Applying these results to the complete set of 24,751 probe sequences in the GQ20+VQSR set, we infer that circa of 21,570 (20,941 × 97% + 3,810 × 33%) probes constitute a highly efficient capture-based genotyping system for the species. Regarding the SNP call and genotyping confidence and considering the overall accuracy we estimated that the GQ20+VQSR probe set can sample nearly 204,000 true SNPs [93,441 × (23,232/11,026) × (21,570/24,751) × (1 + (1 - 81%))] across 18,216 loci (11.1 Mbp) in the genome assembly. Sample-to-sample variation in terms of read counts indicates that this outcome is influenced by the quality of the input DNA and sources of technical variation not evaluated here.3.6. Genomic variant annotation and functional effect predictionFor the 18,216 genomic regions considered reliable analysis targets of this capture system, we produced an annotation of the genetic variants to improve the characterization of the recently reported genome assembly of H. impetiginosus and allow for further genetic research and candidate genes studies in this species. Sequence data in HIMP-1 and HIMP-2 capture assays were combined and processed in our pipeline (see Data and scripts availability) to compile a list of high quality SNP sites across the genome assembly. Given the high sequencing coverage acquired following the combined data sets of the two replicates, the number of quality SNPs found was 210,006, which agrees with our previous expectation of 204,000 SNPs based on the assessment of the sequence capture efficiency. The average sample call rate was 92% (82–99%) and the average SNP call rate was also 92% (62–100%). The 210,006 high-quality candidate SNPs were found in 14,499 genomic regions of 3,973 scaffolds in the assembly. These scaffolds encompass ~290 Mbp of sequence in the 557 Mbp/1C genome of the species. SnpEff annotated 389,568 effects with the largest numbers of effects related to SNPs located in downstream or upstream gene regions (45.80%), exons (32.04%), introns and untranslated gene regions (16.06%) and intergenic regions far from genes (6.09%).4. DiscussionWe have described the development and evaluation of an initial collection of 30,795 probe sequences for SNP discovery and genotyping in the highly heterozygous plant genome Handroanthus impetiginosus. These probes were used as input to a commercially available system for custom target DNA enrichment followed by Illumina sequencing in a sample of 24 trees from six population groups spanning a wide geographic range of the species. With the aid of a genome assembly of a single tree, we performed extensive evaluation of the capture system to provide recommendations for future developments of similar plant genomes. It resulted in a final set of 24,751 capture probes covering 18,216 distinct loci, sampling more than 10 Mbp of the species genome. Variant analysis and SNP discovery allowed characterization of 210,006 SNPs and genotyping with overall level of missing data low for each site (<20%) across samples. We investigated issues such as probe design, sequencing coverage and bioinformatics protocols including the evaluation of the capture efficiency and a reassessment of the technical reproducibility of the assay for SNPs recall and genotyping precision.The methods described here for target enrichment share some common aspects to other genome complexity reduction approaches such as genotype by sequencing (GBS) and RAD sequencing and its variations as they also are intended to provide large numbers of SNPs at a lower cost per sample.37,38 Several additional challenges are faced, however, by these alternative genome complexity reduction methods for direct SNP genotyping. The low sequencing coverage associated to the variable efficiency of DNA digestion results in inconsistent sampling of loci, seriously affecting reproducibility across experiments that tend to exacerbate in heterozygous genomes,39 ultimately biasing diversity measures.40–42 The final number of robust SNPs assayed in large samples is typically only a small fraction of the initial set, defeating the alleged cost advantage.A direct comparison of our sequence capture system with alternative genome complexity reduction methods for direct SNP genotyping is evidently beyond the scope of our research. Studies approaching this issue, however, pointed out that sequence capture consistently provided more reliable and portable data across experiments than RAD for shallow systematics, such as within species.43 Such observations have, indeed, lead to the recent development of combined protocols that ultimately benefit from the lower cost of RAD and the robustness of targeted capture.44It should be said, however, that laboratory methods for capture systems involve decisions which also have the potential to significantly impact the capture efficiency outcome.45 Finally, while whole-genome re-sequencing analysis has also been trending for natural population studies, it is still largely cost-prohibitive for the vast majority of species that are investigated on very low budgets even those with relatively small genomes. Because we were aware of all these issues regarding the challenges of reduced complexity-based methods, we devised several strategies in our analytical pipeline to assess the quality of the sequence data generated in the assay, including a partial replication of the experiment.4.1 Quality of sequence data and challenges in bioinformaticsThe alignment of the sequencing reads obtained for each sample to the genome assembly is an important challenge. Accurate aligner algorithms such as BWA implement mismatch penalty scheme in which sequencing error rate is less than 10% (~6%, for BWA). We observed a varying fraction of unmapped reads which ranged from 10% to nearly 40% for some individuals. These results indicated that genetic variants that distinguish the individuals’ genomes from the reference sequence may have not only caused reads to be misaligned but also led to a variable proportion of unmapped reads, resulting in a biased accounting of sequencing coverage across the genetically diverse populations of H. impetiginosus. As already noted in the literature, the inability to map reads is most likely due to structural rearrangements or insertions in the query genomes, or deletions in the reference.46 For mapped reads, however, mappability within targeted regions was further evaluated using HCMappingQualityFilter in GATK HaplotypeCaller (-mmq 10, default value). This filter is applied as a prelude to variant calling to ensure that only reads that are likely to be informative will be used as evidence of possible variation. Overall good read mappability was achieved, with only 3–4% of the reads being discarded prior to variant calling.Available algorithms for read mapping of divergent reads to a single reference, say up to 10–15%, have been developed such as Stampy.47 Recently developed bioinformatics tools aim to integrate multiple genomes of the same or closely related species into a single space-efficient representation of the graph structure and align read data to this complex structure.48–51 Unfortunately, these tools are not fully integrated in confident tools for SNP calling and genotyping such as the GATK-HaplotypeCaller framework which performs better with aligner tool less tolerable to divergent reads (up to 3–6%) such as BWA.52Sequencing coverage contributes significantly to the total physical coverage of the targeted region and to an accuracy of sequence characterization of that region. At the single sample level, usually 150–200x of read depth is necessary to obtain over than 99.9% total coverage and accuracy across targets.53 However, a depth of coverage as low as 1–2x has been found sufficient for accurate allele calls46 to find common SNPs in a multi-sample sequencing design for a single species or closely related species. In a diploid organism, beginning with a 2x depth of coverage and dividing by the expected allele frequency to be observed (say 5%), the minimum depth necessary would be 40x. In one of our experiments, three of the 24 samples produced sequencing coverage of less than 40x possibly due to poor DNA quality or issues during library preparation.We identified a set of targeted regions containing SNPs that consistently produced data in the sampled individuals with a capture efficiency of 60% or superior at appropriate coverage (>70x). However, we also recognized in our pipeline that some unintended regions with high homology to the target sequence had been captured. In fact, the number of quality calls in the non-targeted regions was ~35% of the total calls (134,126 out of 385,295) as assessed in the preliminary analysis of variation. This indicates that the protocol used for target enrichment and sequence capture can generate a considerable number of reads that maps outside the targeted regions, which limits the degree of sample multiplexing per NGS unit run and also represents a challenge to the read alignment process.53 Nevertheless, while off-target read mapping does represent a challenge to SNP callers it can also be viewed as an opportunity to extend genotyping beyond the designed probe sequences.These off-target variants can be due to many different factors depending on the capture platform, such as the quantity of input DNA, the degree of the target DNA entanglement with other strands during isolation for library preparation, and the ability of the probes to capture DNA segments that are much larger than their desired length based on the probe sequence. These unintended segments may contain repetitive sequences that can be present in many copies resulting in self-priming events during any subsequent amplification step. We speculate that the fraction of calls in off-target regions in our study was most likely caused by the relatively simplified capture and multiplexing system used by the custom multiplexed Capture-Seq method used for DNA enrichment and indexing sequencing libraries.19 Designed to be a fast, low-cost and high throughput method, it does not include fragment size selection and the use of blocking oligos to prevent the enrichment of non-specific targets in the custom enrichment, which are steps commonly used in extended but significantly more expensive protocols. Noteworthy, our first capture assay resulted in 40% of total reads mapping on-target related to the probe sequence coordinates. A partially replicated assay resulted in 50% of total reads mapping on-target. However, with an appropriate definition of target loci, which include 200 bp in each direction from the probe sequence coordinates, the amount of on-target read relative to the total generated reads can reach 60–70%. Given the low cost protocol and a customized probe set for a significantly more heterozygous genome, it is satisfactorily competitive with more refined commercial capture probe assays in humans which report average of on-target reads within 68.4% ± 7.8% (s.d.) such as the NimbleGen SeqCap EZ (Roche, Basel, Switzerland).544.2. The challenge of designing a benchmark strategy to assesses the performance outcome of the custom probe setWe observed that the bioinformatics analysis of the sequence data is another important challenge. Caution is needed to adequately remove probe sequences improperly designed or unreliable for SNP detection. Typically, the design of overlapping sequences tiled across the entire transcript sequences was much satisfactory. Sequences spanning across exon boundaries cannot work well, but they will have neighboring probes which will still give quality data. However, any short exons (below the probe sequence length) may not be recoverable unless they can be ‘padded’ with intronic sequence. The computational prediction of gene models from a preliminary genome assembly provides the adequate resource to target these regions. Furthermore, because the experimental conditions of the genotyping assay cannot be directly predicted, we recommend an evaluation across replicates to assess the overall accuracy in the performance outcome of the custom probe set. In our work, with a careful bioinformatics protocol for variant analysis we could recognize 4,344 probes that were deemed faulty or improper. Additionally, we inferred from a partial replication that another 4,881 probes contributed negatively to the measures of performance of a binary classification test of success/failure to detect the true genotype of samples.In terms of the number of distinct sampled loci, both methods used for probe design led to confident SNP calls in regions flanking the exons in transcripts indicating that the whole transcript can be targeted. Intergenic regions will produce reliable detection of true variants, but can introduce penalties in terms of missing data when the sampled individuals are very diverse. Limited read alignment to a single reference genome due to high rates and/or different patterns of sequence polymorphism between individuals can lead to biased accounting of sequencing coverage around the intergenic, UTRs and introns regions, which can result in inflation of missing data at shared sites when genotyping. Noteworthy, we observe that target capture systems can benefit of alternative approaches for probe capture design that directly use transcript sequences, instead of limiting the design to longer exons as is often the choice.Based on these assessments, we estimated that the efficiency of our custom capture system to reveal high-confidence SNP calls for reliable genotyping in populations of H. impetiginosus from which the samples were drawn is 70% (21,570 successful capture probe sequences out of a total of 30, 795 designed probes). To get higher efficiencies, an interested user can simply use the recommended subset of probes in the VQSR+GQ20 set (Supplementary File S2). In this case, under the expectation of the performance evaluation, the percentage of probe regions that may be produce aligned read depth greater than 40x will be ~87.1% (21,570 probe regions in 24,751). This is within the same order of magnitude, for instance, of the performance of a sequence capture system targeting the gene space of another highly heterozygous forest trees. In Populus trichocarpa and Pinus taeda, 86.8% and 79.1% of the probe regions were on average sequenced at a depth =10x.18,194.3. Missing data at SNPs detected in the capture systemA common issue in studies attempting to use capture probes on divergent genomes is the amount of missing data at any shared site in a diverse sample of individuals. In plants, for instance, a probe set developed based on transcript sequences from loblolly pine (Pinus taeda) was used for DNA enrichment across targeted sequences in 48 individuals of whitebark pine (Pinus albicaulis), resulting in the identification of 528,873 SNPs in 7,849 transcripts.55 In that study, data on genotypes at SNPs was found useful only for 12,390 segregating sites (2% out of 528,873 identified SNPs) in 4,452 transcripts (56.7% out of 7,849). In our study, missing data for any site was concentrated in particular SNPs and populations, suggesting a significant underlying population structure likely leading to an important impact on the sharing of SNP sites. In fact, the SNP data clearly recovered patterns of structure in the populations (see details in Supplementary File S1 and Fig. S1B and C). Besides structure in the data, we could also observe that the patterns of polymorphisms in the sampled individuals differ from a single reference genome at different rates across intergenic, transcribed or protein-coding regions. It is an expected outcome since population-level whole-genome resequencing has revealed that diversity levels in large outbred population—assessed by different measures of nucleotide diversity—within stretches of DNA transcribed into a mRNA molecule is reduced in comparison to intergenic DNA. A recent study in outbred bird species,56 for instance, reported that diversity is related to selective constraint such that in comparison with intergenic DNA, diversity at fourfold degenerate sites was reduced to 85%, 3' UTRs to 82%, 5' UTRs to 70% and non-degenerate sites to 12%. Other studies including outbred tree species such as poplars57 have shown that, among various genomic contexts, the levels of nucleotide diversity were highest at intergenic sites, followed by fourfold synonymous sites, 3' UTRs, 5' UTRs, and introns and were the lowest at 0-fold degenerate sites.4.4. Requirements and recommendationsGiven the per-sample sequencing coverage (i.e. the ratio between the number of quality reads after alignment to a genome and the number of loci) greater than 40x, capture efficiencies >60% are expected and genotype call rates at SNPs may be =92%. Our results suggest that the successful use of this sequence capture system would encompass the generation of >3.9 million of 100 bp single-end reads per-sample across the 18,216 targeted loci defined by location of the recommended 24,771 probe sequences in the call set ‘GQ20+VQSR’. This lower-bound value was adjusted considering the observed ratio between on-target and off-target read alignments (35%, in our data). Adjustment has also been performed due to the limited read alignment to the reference assembly (60–90%, in our data), because of structural rearrangements or insertions in the query genome, or deletions in the reference assembly due to divergent evolutionary history of the population to which the sample belongs. The bioinformatics protocol for data analysis is standard for analysis of variation using Illumina’s NGS technology and reference-based methods of SNP identification and involves the steps summarized in Fig. 1 and detailed in the Supplementary File S1. It includes the target loci definition, the creation of a database of variant resources and the likelihoods that these variants exist and the recalibration for all evaluated variants.4.5. Prospects of the sequence capture system for population genetic studiesWe used the genotypic data on the cataloged 210,006 SNP from the two genotyping assays using our custom probe set to look at some population features as a preamble to population genomics studies in H. impetiginosus. From a purely observational standpoint, due to the small number of sampled individuals, the shape of the SFS distribution (Supplementary Fig. S1A) may suggest a pattern consistent with incomplete lineage sorting and/or mutation bias among the sampled sub-groups. These preliminary results are consistent with previous phylogenetic analyses showing evidences of incomplete lineage sorting in Handroanthus species across populations in Central Brazil but without recovering the shared ancestral haplotypes between them.23,58 If there is an underlying structure in the data (see Supplementary File S1 and Fig. S1B and C) and if genes did not coalesce at the same time that the sub-groups delimitation occurred in a recent past, differences in the allele frequency distribution can be observed on the entire SFS in comparison with the expected distribution under mutation-drift equilibrium. Thus, the small number of generations that have passed until sub-group delimitation may have contributed in maintaining larger than expected SNPs at intermediate to high frequency. Based on these observations, we expect that this capture system along with available tools for phase and haplotype identification should provide the necessary framework to provide more definitive evidences in support of these findings.In conclusion, we have reported a targeted SNP resource for Handroanthus impetiginosus, a highly valued tree, with a notable ecological keystone status in SDTFs of South America and Mesoamerica. The successful use of this 24,751 capture probes system requires the generation of ~4 million of 100 bp single-end reads per-sample to provide robust genotyping across 18,216 distinct loci sampling more than 10 Mbp of the species genome. This system identifies nearly 200,000 SNPs located inside or in close proximity to almost 14,000 annotated protein-coding genes, generating quality genotypic data in populations spanning wide geographic distances across the species native range. Prospects of population genetic studies indicate that this platform can be used to estimate population genetics parameters and carry on investigations of the interplay of ecology and evolution at the genome-wide scale. We emphasize though that the preliminary population-level analyses presented here with a limited sample of individuals was only meant to provide a first exploratory assessment on the evolution of genome sequences in H. impetiginosus, and by no means we imply that these analyses are representative but rather observational. To that end, we are currently using this capture system to characterize polymorphisms in a follow-up study with a larger set of individuals sampled in 13 demographic groups across the Brazilian territory. Going beyond the significance of these results for the species, this study paves the way for the development of similar genomic resources for other Neotropical forest trees of equivalent or higher relevance. This in turn will open exceptional prospects to advance the understanding of the evolutionary history, species distribution and population demography of the still largely neglected forest trees of the mega diverse tropical biomes.5.

Since this study offers comprehensive annotation of predicted protein-coding genes, it has potential broad application to our understanding of yellowtail biology and aquaculture.1. IntroductionThe genus Seriola (family Carangidae) contains nine recognized species of carnivorous, marine fish, globally distributed in tropical, subtropical and temperate ocean regions.1,Seriola species have a high market value and several species are farmed around the world.2 Japan is the biggest producer of Seriola species, farming yellowtail (S. quinqueradiata), greater amberjack (S. dumerili) and yellowtail kingfish (S. lalandi). In 2016 the production of these three species was 141,000 tons, accounting for over 56% of marine finfish aquaculture in Japan.3 Most of this production is accounted for by yellowtail, which has the longest history of aquaculture, having started in 1927 and expanded rapidly in the 1960s.4 Although yellowtail aquaculture technologies have continued to improve, several challenges to the sustainable farming of this species remain to be addressed. The price of fish meal used for yellowtail feed continues to rise,5 necessitating a better understanding of yellowtail digestive pathways and nutritional requirements in order to develop more cost-effective feeds.To improve aquaculture production efficiency, product quality, sustainability and profitability, recent efforts have focussed on the genetics and genomics of economically important aquaculture species, particularly following the development of high-throughput next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies.6–8 Genetic maps9–11 and a whole genome radiation hybrid panel12 for yellowtail have been constructed, and the detection of quantitative trait loci (QTL) in yellowtail has recently been initiated for resistance to a monogenean parasite, Benedenia seriolae,13 and sex-determination.14,15 However, the resources for genes and protein annotations for this species are limited. Only 257 protein sequences have been deposited at NCBI Genbank, taxonomy ID: 8161 (as of 11 July 2018). A comprehensive annotation of the overall protein-coding genes for the yellowtail genome will help identify important genes and pathways involved in the regulation of economically important traits. In addition, a well-annotated genome will provide a powerful tool for better understanding yellowtail biology, and will enhance physiological studies for optimization of breeding technologies, including the development of artificial diets.Recently, we demonstrated that use of the genome of a haploid gynogenetic yellowtail larva leads to a significant improvement in de novo assembly because allelic variation does not impede contig extension as it does for assembly of diploid genomes.16 Here, we present a draft genome sequence for yellowtail based on a haploid genome assembly and its annotation of protein-coding genes. Furthermore, to better understand molecular mechanisms of feed digestion and nutrient absorption in yellowtail, we performed RNA-Seq analysis of the three major organs of the gastrointestinal (GI) tract i.e. stomach, intestine and rectum, using the annotated draft yellowtail genome as a reference. The analysis suggested that certain proteolytic digestive enzymes play key roles in digestion and absorption, and could inform the choice of ingredients for the development of yellowtail-specific feeds for use in aquaculture.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome sequencing and assemblyPreparation of genomic DNA from haploid gynogenetic yellowtail larvae induced by ultraviolet-irradiated sperm and the blood of its dam (diploid genome) has been described in.16 For contig construction, the genomic shotgun libraries were prepared from the haploid genomic DNA, and sequenced with the Ion PGM (two runs) and Proton (four runs) platforms (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA). These haploid reads were assembled using Newbler 3.0 (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland). Four Illumina paired-end (PE) libraries (insert size: 240, 360, 480 and 720 bp) and three mate-pair (MP) libraries (insert size: 3–5, 10 and 20 kb) were constructed from the diploid dam genomic DNA and sequenced on a NextSeq 500 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) using 2 × 150 bp chemistry. To improve sequence accuracy of the haploid contig sequences generated by Ion PGM and Proton sequencers, the Illumina PE reads were mapped against the haploid contigs using Burrows–Wheeler aligner-maximum exact matches (BWA-MEM),17 and nucleotide mismatches or short indels were overridden by the Illumina read sequences. We also carried out a de novo assembly of the four diploid Illumina PE libraries (all merged 240 bp, and 10 Gb of 360, 480 and 720 bp inserts) with Platanus 1.2.4,18 and performed a sequence comparison between the haploid and diploid contigs using BLASTN19 (E value threshold of 1E – 20 and the bit score of the top hit with a more than 2-fold difference over that of the second hit),20 and the diploid contigs absent in the haploid contigs were added to the haploid contigs. These merged contigs were subjected to scaffolding using Platanus 1.2.418 together with all the Illumina PE (unmerged 240, 360, 480 and 720 bp insert) and MP reads (3–5, 10 and 20 kb insert), and gaps in the scaffolds were filled by the Illumina PE reads (unmerged 240, 360, 480 and 720 bp inserts) with the gap-close step in Platanus. The resulting scaffolds were further assembled using RNA-Seq data sets generated in this study (described later), by L_RNA_scaffolder.21To confirm ploidy level and estimate genome size, Jellyfish software22 was used to produce a k-mer distribution (19-mer) with the Ion Proton haploid reads and with the Illumina PE diploid reads (all merged 240 bp, and 10 Gb of 360, 480 and 720 bp inserts).2.2. Linkage map construction and scaffold correctionTo detect and correct scaffold misassemblies, we generated a double-digest restriction-site associated DNA (ddRAD)-based genetic linkage map of the yellowtail using a previously described method20 with slight modifications. Briefly, genomic DNA samples were extracted from 161 full-sib progeny and their parents’ muscles using the DNeasy Blood & Tissue Kit (Qiagen, Venlo, Netherlands). For preparation of the ddRAD libraries, genomic DNA was digested using two restriction enzymes (PstI and MspI) and ligated to Ion Plus Fragment Library Adapters using an Ion Xpress Plus gDNA Fragment Library kit (Life technologies). The ligation products from ~25 individuals were pooled in equimolar proportions and size-selected within a range of 200–260 bp using BluePippin (Sage Science, Beverly, MA, USA). After size selection, the ddRAD libraries were amplified by eight-cycle PCR, purified using Agencourt AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter Inc., Brea, CA, USA), and sequenced on the Ion Proton (Life technologies). Raw sequences were filtered to discard those of low quality and demultiplexed using the process_radtags programme in Stacks.23 BWA-MEM17 was used to map the filtered ddRAD-Seq reads to the scaffold sequences, and the output SAM file was filtered using custom Perl scripts based on the following criteria: mapping quality (MQ) of = 30, length fraction of 0.95 and non-specific match handling of ignore. After local realignment, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) calling was performed using the Unified Genotyper module in the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK)24 and the variants were filtered as follows: only bi-allelic sites, genotype quality (GQ) of = 30, either reference (REF) or alternative (ALT) allele frequencies of = 95% in homozygous sites and both REF and ALT allele frequencies of = 30% in heterozygous sites. The R/qtl package25 was employed for linkage analysis and linkage map construction with the same parameters as previously described in.20 Linkage group (LG) numbering and orientation followed that of Fuji et al.10 To detect the possibility of misassembled chimeric scaffolds, the linkage marker sequences were mapped to the scaffold sequences with BLASTN using the same criteria as previously described in20; the scaffolds attributed to two or more LGs were split into consistent scaffolds based on the locations of markers. Scaffolds >2 kb in length were used for subsequent analysis.2.3. Evaluation of completeness of the final assemblyA completeness assessment was performed with gVolante26 using the pipeline CEGMA (Core Eukaryotic Genes Mapping Approach)27 and the reference dataset Core Vertebrate Genes (CVGs).28 We also assessed the assembly quality by Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologues (BUSCO)29 version 3.0.2 with an Actinopterygii-specific set of 4,584 single copy orthologs.2.4. cDNA sequencingFor gene predictions, normalized, full-length enriched cDNA libraries were constructed as follows: Total RNAs were isolated from eighteen yellowtail tissues (gills, skin, fins, red muscle, white muscle, heart, kidney, spleen, stomach, intestine, pyloric caeca, liver, gallbladder, retina, cerebellum, optic lobe, olfactory lobe and ovary) using RNeasy Plus Universal Mini Kit (Qiagen). The isolated total RNA samples were treated with 2 U of TURBO DNase from the TURBO DNase-free Kit (Life Technologies) at 37°C for 30 min as recommended by the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA integrity was assessed with an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 with the RNA 6000 Nano Kit (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA). Poly(A) + RNA (mRNA) was purified using the FastTrack MAG Micro mRNA Isolation Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Equal amounts of mRNA were pooled from each tissue and 500 ng of the pooled mRNA was used to construct a full-length enriched cDNA library using the SMART PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech Laboratories, Inc. Palo Alto, CA, USA) with modifications as described by Meyer et al.30 The primer used for first-strand cDNA synthesis was a modified 3’ SMART CDS Primer II A (AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGTCGCAGTCGGTACTTTTTTCTTTTTTV) including a recognition site for the restriction enzyme BpmI,30 and the cDNA was amplified using the 5’ PCR Primer II A (AAGCAGTGGTATCAACGCAGAGT) with the KAPA library amplification kit (KAPA Biosystems, Boston, MA, USA). Amplified cDNA was purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification Kit (Qiagen) and normalized using a Trimmer-2 cDNA normalization kit (Evrogen, Moscow, Russia). The normalized cDNA was purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit, and the purified cDNA was digested with BpmI for 1 h at 37°C to remove poly (A) tails. Finally, the digested cDNA was purified using a QIAquick PCR purification kit. In addition to the 18-tissue normalized cDNA library, additional full-length cDNA libraries for pituitary, testis, ovary haploid cells and digestive organs from larval fish (8–10 days post-hatch) were prepared individually with the SMART PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit employing the same procedure as above. Among these, the cDNA libraries for the digestive organs from the larval fish were normalized using the methods above. These cDNA libraries were sequenced with the 454 GS FLX+ (Roche Diagnostics), Ion PGM or Proton platforms (Life Technologies). Detailed information on the cDNA libraries with corresponding sequencers and sequence statistics are summarized in Supplementary Table S2.2.5. Gene prediction and annotationProtein-coding genes in the yellowtail genome were predicted using AUGUSTUS (version 3.1).31 First, repeat regions in the yellowtail scaffold sequences (>2 kb) were masked by RepeatMasker32 according to the yellowtail repeat database constructed by RepeatModeler.33 Next, the RNA-Seq reads of yellowtail sequenced in this study were mapped to the scaffolds using TopHat34 and assembled with Cufflinks.35 Then, the scaffold sequences were scanned with the Zebrafish model in AUGUSTUS, using the map information of RNA-Seq as hints. The predicted gene sequences (24,728 genes) were validated using BUSCO,29 and loci attributed to ‘complete’ (792 loci) were used to construct a yellowtail gene training model. Moreover, protein sequences of 11 fish species: spotted gar (Lepisosteus oculatus), Mexican tetra (Astyanax mexicanus), zebrafish (Danio rerio), Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua), Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus), platyfish (Xiphophorus maculatus), Amazon molly (Poecilia formosa), medaka (Oryzias latipes), stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus), green puffer (Tetraodon nigroviridis) and fugu (Takifugu rubripes), were downloaded from the Ensembl database (Release 84),36 mapped to the yellowtail scaffolds by TBLASTN37 with E-value < 10-5, and the map information was used as hints in AUGUSTUS. Finally, the predicted gene sequences were analysed with InterProScan38 and those matched by any domain or supported by any AUGUSTUS hint were collected as valid protein-coding genes.The predicted amino acid sequences were compared using BLASTP19 (E value threshold of 1E - 5) against those of well-annotated model fishes, medaka and zebrafish, in the Ensembl database (Release 84),36 and against the NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database. Functional annotation was performed using Blast2GO39 and the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) Automatic Annotation Server.40 Orthologous gene cluster analysis of yellowtail, Pacific bluefin tuna (Thunnus orientalis),41 croaker (Larimichthys crocea),42 Nile tilapia, medaka and zebrafish was performed using the OrthoVenn43 web server with default parameters (E-value 1e–5, inflation value 1.5). OrthoVenn was also used to assign significantly enriched GO terms of species-specific gene clusters based on a hypergeometric test (P-value < 0.05). The same analysis also applied to comparisons within the genus Seriola including yellowtail, S. dumerili (Genbank: BDQW01000000) and S. dorsalis (Genbank: PEQF01000000).2.6. RNA-Seq analysis of yellowtail GI tractThe three major organs of the GI tract: stomach, intestine and rectum, were dissected from three healthy adult yellowtails (n = 3) obtained from brood stock maintained at the Goto laboratory of the Seikai National Fisheries Research Institute, Nagasaki, Japan and immediately immersed in RNAlater stabilized solution (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Total RNA was extracted using the Maxwell RSC simply RNA Kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) and mRNA was purified from 3 µg total RNA using the Gene Read Pure mRNA kit (Qiagen). Sequencing libraries were constructed from 5 ng of each mRNA sample using the Ion Total RNA-Seq Kit v2 and sequenced with Ion Proton (Life technologies). RNA-Seq data analysis was carried out using CLC Genomics Workbench 9.5.2 software (CLC Bio, Aarhus, Denmark) as follows: The low-quality sequences were filtered with default parameters (quality limit = 0.05 and ambiguous limit = 2), and the filtered sequence reads were mapped to the yellowtail reference genome constructed in this study with default parameters (mismatch cost = 2, insertion cost = 3 and deletion cost = 3, length fraction = 0.8 and similarity fraction = 0.8). Subsequently, transcripts per millions (TPMs)44 values for each gene were calculated. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were considered significant for the following criteria: a 2-fold or greater change in expression with a false discovery rate P-value < 0.05. Visualization of the DEGs was performed by constructing a hierarchical heatmap with Euclidean distance and complete linkage in the CLC Genomics Workbench. To compare the over-represented functional categories between the highly expressed genes (500 highest TPM values) in the three tissues, a GO enrichment analysis was conducted using the functional annotation tool, PANTHER version 12.0 (released 7 Ocotber 2017)45 using the zebrafish gene list. The Bonferroni correction for multiple testing was applied with the corrected P-value < 0.05 considered significantly over-represented in the PANTHER analysis.3. Results and discussion3.1. Genome sequencing and assemblyRecent advances in the speed, accuracy and cost effectiveness of NGS technologies have provided the opportunity for whole genome sequencing of even non-model organisms with no available reference genomes. However, de novo assembly of diploid species, including teleosts, remains challenging because of allelic variation. Recently, several teleost studies have used DNA samples with theoretically no allelic variations as biological starting material for genome assembly. Zhang et al.46 reported a marked improvement in genome assembly after employing doubled-haploid fugu individuals via mitotic gynogenesis. Although doubled haploid fishes are useful in genomic analysis, limited doubled haploid fish lines are available, and their establishment is labour-intensive, time-consuming and expensive. On the other hand, the use of haploid larvae is a convenient means of obtaining a non-allelic variation genome in fish if an artificial insemination technique is established, and we have already demonstrated the effectiveness of genomic DNA from a haploid gynogenetic yellowtail larva in genome assembly.16 However, there are two concerns related to the use of haploid fish larvae for the construction of reference genome sequences. To overcome these concerns, we established an assembling strategy (Fig. 1) as follows. First, defective regions may exist in the haploid genome sequence due to allelic variations. Taking this probability into account, we compared the haploid contigs with those generated from its dam (diploid), and then merged the diploid sequences absent in the haploid contigs (Fig. 1). Second, because haploid larvae die during early larval stages, the amount of DNA available from a haploid fish larva is limited, and not sufficient for the preparation of PE and MP libraries for scaffolding. To make up for this limitation, the contigs were constructed from limited amounts of DNA from a haploid fish, and scaffolding was performed using sufficiently available DNA from its dam (Fig. 1). Strategy for de novo assembly of the yellowtail (S. quinqueradiata) genome using the genome of haploid larvae. More detailed information on the sequencing libraries and the summary statistics of reads used in this study can be found in Supplementary Table S1, and contig and scaffold statistics are shown in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, respectively.Strategy for de novo assembly of the yellowtail (S. quinqueradiata) genome using the genome of haploid larvae. More detailed information on the sequencing libraries and the summary statistics of reads used in this study can be found in Supplementary Table S1, and contig and scaffold statistics are shown in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, respectively.In this study, a total of 11.2 million reads (3.7 Gb) and 259.4 million reads (51.9 Gb) from the haploid genome were generated from Ion PGM and Ion Proton, respectively, and a total of 858 million reads (129.1 Gb) were obtained from a series of Illumina PE (240 bp insert: 27.8 Gb, 360 bp insert: 31.5 Gb, 480 bp insert: 25.3 Gb and 720 bp insert: 9.5 Gb) and MP (3–5 kb insert: 10.8 Gb, 10 kb insert: 12.2 Gb and 20 kb insert: 12.0 Gb) libraries of the diploid genome (Supplementary Table S1). The genome size of the yellowtail has been calculated to be ~685 Mb based on the c-value,10 while the genome size based on k-mer frequency was estimated to be 603.8 and 602.7 Mb from the haploid and diploid reads datasets, respectively. Thus, the generated sequence data (184.7 Gb) has 270- to 306-fold coverage of its genome size. Figure 1 provides a flow diagram of the genome assembly procedure used for this study; information on the sequencing libraries and summary statistics of reads appears in Supplementary Table S1. Because our previous study demonstrated that the overlap-layout-consensus (OLC)-based de novo assembly (i.e. Newbler) was the most efficient method for haploid reads generated from the Ion Torrent sequencing platform,16 the haploid reads (55.6 Gb) were assembled by Newbler and generated 90,827 contigs (>500 bp) with a total length with 611.9 Mb (Fig. 1, Contigs A and Supplementary Table S3). On the other hand, a 52.1 Gb of diploid reads from the four Illumina PE libraries (Supplementary Table S1) were assembled with Platanus, a de novo assembler specifically designed to reconstruct highly heterozygous genomes,18 and the resulting assembly consists of 209,882 contigs (>500 bp) with a total length with 596.7 Mb (Fig. 1, Contigs B and Supplementary Table S3). Although different types of sequencers and assemblers were used for the haploid and diploid reads, the assembly of the haploid genome significantly reduced the total number of contigs with longer average and N50 contig lengths when compared with the diploid genome assembly (Supplementary Table S3). Furthermore, the k-mer distribution of the diploid reads showed an additional small peak which corresponds to heterozygous regions, i.e. a ‘hetero-peak’18 (Supplementary Fig. S1). These heterozygous regions may disrupt the extension of contigs during the assembly process.16 Thus, these results support the argument for using the haploid genome for de novo assembly.After sequence error correction of the haploid contigs using 94.1 Gb of Illumina PE reads (Fig. 1, Contigs A’), the diploid contigs (Fig. 1, Contigs B) absent in the haploid contigs (Fig. 1, Contigs A’) were added to the haploid contigs. This process could add 26,916 contigs (4.5 Mb) to the haploid contigs, and generated 162,987 contigs (Fig. 1, Contigs C and Supplementary Table S3). These merged contigs (Fig. 1, Contigs C) were subjected to scaffolding with 71.5 Gb of Illumina PE and 35.0 Gb of Illumina MP reads (Supplementary Table S1), and the resulting scaffolds were filled by 71.5 Gb of Illumina PE reads (Supplementary Table S1). As a result, 1,225 scaffolds (>2 kb) were obtained (Fig. 1, Scaffolds A and Supplementary Table S4). Further scaffolding using RNA-Seq datasets generated in this study (Supplementary Table S2) was conducted and 1,155 scaffolds (>2 kb) were constructed (Fig. 1, Scaffolds B and Supplementary Table S4). Finally, the linkage marker sequences from the ddRAD-based genetic linkage map of the yellowtail generated in this study were used to correct the scaffold misassemblies (Fig 1, Final scaffolds). The female and male maps (consisting of 1, 163 and 1, 147 ddRAD markers for female and male maps, respectively) for LGs (LG1–LG24) are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2, and the locations of genetic markers are listed in Supplementary Table S5. The final assembly is composed of 1, 394 scaffolds (>2 kb) and the total size of scaffolds is 627.3 Mb, with a G + C content of 40.9%, an N50 length of 1.43 Mb (number of N50 or longer: 127) and a largest scaffold size of 6.62 Mb (Table 1). Assembly statistics of yellowtail genomeAssembly statistics of yellowtail genomeThe completeness of the generated genome assembly was evaluated using CEGMA analysis, which identified 97.86% complete and 98.28% partial genes from the 233 CVGs. This percentage of complete gene hits is higher than that of model fish genome assemblies such as medaka (93.56%), zebrafish (93.13%), stickleback (92.27%) and spotted green puffer (90.56%), according to the gVolante, Completeness Score Database (https://gvolante.riken.jp/script/database.cgi (11 July 2018, date last accessed)). Recently, two yellowtail genome assemblies (Squ_1.0 and Squ_2.0) have been deposited at DDBJ/EMBL/Genbank under accession numbers BDJM01000000 (Squ_1.0) and BDMU00000000 (Squ_2.0). According to assembly information at NCBI (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/organism/8161/all/ (11 July 2018, date last accessed)), both assemblies were generated from diploid DNA samples with an Illumina Hiseq2500 platform and a long-read sequencer PacBio RSII. Squ_2.0 is an updated version of Squ_1.0 and is representative of the genome of this species at present. Although Squ_2.0 has fewer scaffolds (384) and a larger N50 scaffold size (5.6 Mb) than our assembly, the assembly quality based on BUSCO and CEGMA analysis showed that our assembly has higher scores than those of Squ_2.0 in both analyses. Our assembly captured 97.27% (4,459 out of 4,584) of complete BUSCOs, while Squ_2.0 captured 96.81% (4,438 out of 4,584). Similarly, CEGMA evaluation showed that the completeness of our assembly and that of Squ_2.0 was 97.85% (228 out of 233) and 97.42% (227 out of 233), respectively. Despite using relatively short sequence reads for the genome assembly, we obtained a high level of completeness in BUSCO and CEGMA analyses, suggesting the advantage of utilizing the haploid genome for de novo assembly. Thus, we concluded that our assembly has a more complete gene space than Squ_2.0 and is more suitable for conducting gene-prediction and annotation of yellowtail.3.2. Annotation of protein-coding genesA total of 27,693 protein-coding genes were predicted for the yellowtail draft genome, based on AUGUSTUS, the yellowtail training model and the transcript + protein hints. A summary of the functional annotation of the yellowtail predicted genes is shown in Table 2 and the results of the functional annotation of the complete set of predicted protein-coding genes are available in Supplementary Table S7. Of the 27,693 predicted genes, 25,319 (91.4%) genes matched (E value threshold of 1 E - 5) at least one entry in the NCBI nr database, while 21,233 (76.7%) and 23,422 (84.6%) genes matched with model fishes, medaka and zebrafish, respectively (Table 2). A total of 18,575 (67.1%) genes mapped to at least one GO term (biological process: 12,606 genes, cellular component: 11,784 genes and molecular function: 13,094 genes). In addition, 13,880 (50.1%) genes were mapped to KEGG pathways, while 2,867 genes were identified to have at least one enzyme hit. The conserved domain search (InterPro) showed that 25,035 (90.4%) genes were identified to have at least one domain. Overall, 25,832 predicted genes (93.3%) of yellowtail were functionally annotated by at least one database, and only 1,861 predicted genes (6.7%) were unannotated (Table 2). This richness in functional annotation for yellowtail protein-coding genes will help us to better understand their biology in downstream studies, such as whole-transcriptome analysis. Functional annotation of the 27,693 yelowtail predicted protein-coding genesBLASTP hit of less than 1E-5.Functional annotation of the 27,693 yelowtail predicted protein-coding genesBLASTP hit of less than 1E-5.The genome-wide comparison of orthologous gene clusters was performed to identify the degree of commonality across yellowtail and five other teleost species: Pacific bluefin tuna, croaker, tilapia, medaka and zebrafish. Based on sequence similarity of proteins, all protein sequences from the six species were grouped into 21,658 clusters, from which 9,444 (43.6%) orthologous gene clusters were shared by all six species and 20,787 (96.0%) orthologous clusters contained at least two species (Fig. 2A). On the other hand, 871 (4.0%) single-species clusters: 114 clusters (336 genes) for yellowtail, 125 clusters (364 genes) for Pacific bluefin tuna, 105 clusters (236 genes) for croaker, 109 clusters (326 genes) for tilapia, 119 (490 genes) clusters for medaka and 299 (1,515 genes) clusters for zebrafish, were identified (Fig. 2A), suggesting a lineage-specific expansion of these clusters. As seen earlier, the number of zebrafish-specific clusters was 2.4- to 2.7-fold higher than those for the other five teleosts, including yellowtail, which may explain the notable gene duplication and retention of recent duplicates in zebrafish after a teleost-specific genome duplication event around 300 million years ago.47 A hypergeometric test for assessing enriched GO terms in the single-species clusters was performed. Overall, many immune-related GO terms were found in the significantly enriched GO terms of species-specific clusters, except for those in madaka, which showed that transposon-related GO terms were the most significant (P = 2.58E-4) (Supplementary Table S8). Venn diagram showing the number of unique and shared gene clusters in (A) six teleosts (yellowtail, Pacific bluefin tuna, croaker, tilapia, medaka and zebrafish) and in (B) three Seriola species: yellowtail, greater amberjack (S. dumerili) and California yellowtail (S. dorsalis). Orthologous gene clusters were identified and visualized using OrthoVenn.43 The bar charts below the Venn diagrams represent the total number of clusters that are unique to a single species or shared between 2 and 6 species.Venn diagram showing the number of unique and shared gene clusters in (A) six teleosts (yellowtail, Pacific bluefin tuna, croaker, tilapia, medaka and zebrafish) and in (B) three Seriola species: yellowtail, greater amberjack (S. dumerili) and California yellowtail (S. dorsalis). Orthologous gene clusters were identified and visualized using OrthoVenn.43 The bar charts below the Venn diagrams represent the total number of clusters that are unique to a single species or shared between 2 and 6 species.Focussing on the yellowtail-specific clusters, one of the most significant GO terms was taurine: sodium symporter activity (GO: 0005369, P = 0.015), containing two taurine transporter (TauT/Slc6a6) genes, g27489 and g26790 (Supplementary Table S8). TauT mediates cellular uptake of taurine (2-aminoethane sulphonic acid) which is found in high concentrations in animal tissues.48 Taurine is a vital nutrient for many fish species, particularly for carnivorous fish, due to their limited taurine biosynthesis abilities.49 It has been reported that taurine synthesis is markedly low or negligible in yellowtail.50 Therefore, the absorption of taurine from feeds via TauT is arguably important for yellowtail. Further study of the two TauT genes from the yellowtail-specific cluster will provide insight into taurine absorption in this species.Draft genomes for greater amberjack (S. dumerili)51 and California yellowtail (S. dorsalis)52 have recently been published. We compared the predicted-protein sequences of yellowtail with those of these two Seriola species. The protein sequences from yellowtail (27,693), greater amberjack (22,005) and California yellowtail (25,789) were grouped into 20,499 clusters from which 17,197 (84%) clusters were shared across all three species, and 20,058 (97.8%) clusters contained at least two species (Fig. 2B). We found 441 single-species clusters (2.2%) including 221 clusters (814 genes) from yellowtail, 22 clusters (53 genes) from greater amberjack and 198 clusters (416 genes) from California yellowtail (Fig. 2B). As in the results of the comparisons with five teleosts, the most significant enriched GO terms in yellowtail- and greater amberjack-specific clusters were related to immune processes such as antigen binding (GO: 0003823, P = 5.1E-4) in yellowtail and positive regulation of interleukin-1 beta secretion (GO: 0050718, P = 3.9E-4) in greater amberjack (Supplementary Table S9). California yellowtail-specific clusters showed regulation of osteoclast differentiation (GO: 0045670, P = 0.008) and regulation of RNA stability (GO: 0043487, P = 0.008) as the most enriched clusters, but the significance of these data is unclear (Supplementary Table S9). Together with the results of the comparison across six teleosts, most of the species-specific clusters included immune-related GO terms, suggesting that lineage-specific expansion of immune-related genes is likely to play a key role in species diversification. This may be due to the remarkable evolutionary plasticity of the teleost immune system in response to habitat, specific environmental factors and lineage-specific pathogens, and which is linked to the survival and radiation of the teleost linnage.53,543.3. A snapshot of yellowtail GI tract transcriptomeWe used our yellowtail reference genome for RNA-Seq analysis of three major organs of the GI tract: stomach, intestine and rectum as a first step toward understanding digestion and nutrient absorption in yellowtail at the molecular level. This RNA-Seq generated 10,692,067–27,326,877 reads (mean read length: 135–167 bp) per individual tissue type (Supplementary Table S6).First, we characterized the highly expressed genes (top 500) in each tissue using a GO enrichment analysis, because the highly expressed genes can be considered to serve functionally important roles in the respective tissues that will help us to understand the mode of operation of each tissue. This analysis showed that most of the enriched categories were shared between the intestine and rectum, and included: ‘metallopeptidase activity’ (GO: 0008237, nine genes each in intestine and rectum), ‘serine-type peptidase activity’ (GO: 0008236, 13 genes each in intestine and rectum), ‘peptidase activity’ (GO: 0008233, 29 genes each in intestine and rectum), ‘hydrolase activity’ (GO: 0016787, 62 genes in intestine and 66 genes in rectum) under the molecular function category, and ‘proteolysis’ (GO: 0006508, 31 genes in intestine and 33 genes in rectum) under the biological process category (Fig. 3). These categories are involved in the hydrolysis of proteins into smaller polypeptides, suggesting that both the intestine and rectum function to digest protein in the yellowtail. We also found enriched GO terms common in the stomach and rectum that are related to proton transport activity, including ‘proton-transporting ATP synthase activity, rotational mechanism’ (GO: 0046933, five genes in stomach and six genes in rectum), ‘hydrogen ion transmembrane transporter activity’ (GO: 0015078, seven genes in stomach and eight genes in rectum) under the molecular function category, and ‘proton-transporting ATP synthase complex’ (GO: 0045259, five genes in stomach and six genes in rectum) under the cellular component category (Fig. 3). These genes probably contribute to the acidity of the stomach necessary for acid hydrolysis of feeds.55 In general, carnivorous fish have well developed stomachs capable of an acid digestion phase, whereas in stomach-less fish such as carp, no such phase exists.56 In the rectum, these genes may play a role in osmoregulation.57 The stomach has more non-overlapping enriched GO terms than other organs, and overexpressed ‘oxidoreductase activity’ (GO: 0016491, 24 genes), ‘isomerase activity’ (GO: 0016853, 11 genes) under the molecular function category, ‘tricarboxylic acid cycle’ (GO: 0006099, five genes), ‘glycolysis’ (GO: 0006096, six genes), ‘generation of precursor metabolites and energy’ (GO: 0006091, 19 genes) under the biological process category, and ‘mitochondrial inner membrane’ (GO: 0005743, six genes) under the cellular component category (Fig. 3). These GO terms suggest the role of the stomach in energy metabolism. Although interpretation of the roles of these genes is unclear, these results suggest that the digestive function of the stomach differs from that of the intestine and rectum in yellowtail. GO enrichment analysis of the top 500 highly expressed genes in the yellowtail stomach, intestine and rectum. This analysis was performed using PANTHER45 and the zebrafish gene list was selected.

This analysis was performed using PANTHER45 and the zebrafish gene list was selected. Values indicate fold enrichment (P-value < 0.05 after Bonferroni correction) and NS means not significant.Next, we surveyed DEGs among the three organs to identify tissue-specific gene expression patterns. The number of DEGs in the stomach, when compared with those in the intestine and rectum were 6,001 and 6,040, respectively, indicating that the expression pattern of the stomach was different from those of the intestine and rectum, as expected by the GO enrichment analysis of the highly expressed genes (Fig. 3). The comparison between the intestine and the rectum also showed considerable differences in the gene expression pattern, with 2,195 DEGs, suggesting that each part has a specialized function in digestive and absorption processes. Similarly, over 1,900 DEGs (fold-change cutoff of 2) were observed between anterior-middle and posterior-intestinal segments (including the rectum) in a carnivorous fish, European sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax) using a custom oligo microarray.58 Using a cluster analysis of the DEGs, we extracted expression patterns that are characteristic of the three tissue types (Supplementary Fig. S3). Figure 4 shows the heat map of 30 DEGs with the highest coefficient of variation among the three tissues. Heat map of 30 DEGs with the highest coefficient of variation among the yellowtail stomach (st), intestine (int) and rectum (rec).Heat map of 30 DEGs with the highest coefficient of variation among the yellowtail stomach (st), intestine (int) and rectum (rec).A gene encoding potassium-transporting ATPase alpha chain 1 (g269), which has a role in acid production in the mammalian stomach55,59 was specifically expressed in the stomach (Fig. 4). As mentioned above, this gene may facilitate the acidic environment of the yellowtail stomach. In addition, four genes (g6958, g17761, g17762 and g23012) encoding pepsinogens, and activated to the active form pepsin under acidic conditions,60 were specifically expressed in the stomach (Fig. 4). In vertebrates, including fish, pepsin has been identified as the major acidic protease in the stomach, acting during the earliest stage of protein digestion in breaking down long-chain peptides.61,62 In particular, carnivorous fish have higher pepsin levels in their stomachs than omnivorous fish with stomachs and stomach-less fish,63 such as zebrafish, which lack the pepsinogen gene.64 Another digestive enzyme, encoded by a chitinase gene (g6038), was also found in the stomach-specific cluster (Fig. 4). It has been reported that the fish stomach exhibits chitinase activity, which is associated with the digestion of chitinous substances from crustaceans.65,66 We found two stomach-specific genes, the Fc fragment of IgG binding protein (FCGBP; g2075) and cysteine-rich secretory protein 2 (CRISP2; g10639). FCGBP (g2075) is abundant in the mucus of humans and mice, and may be functionally related to the gel-forming mucins,67 while CRISP2 is strongly expressed in the mammalian male reproductive tract.68 Since the function of these two genes in fish has not been elucidated, further studies are required to identify the role of these genes in the yellowtail stomach.As expected following the results of the GO enrichment analysis (Fig. 3), proteolytic digestive enzyme genes, a trypsinogen (precursor of trypsin) gene (g15220), two chymotrypsinogen (precursor of chymotrypsin) genes (g21846 and g21847) and a carboxypeptidase B gene (g11916) were found to be specifically expressed in the intestine and the rectum (Fig. 4). In vertebrates including fish, hydrolysis and absorption of proteins occurs primarily in the intestine.69 It has been reported that trypsin activity in fish is significantly higher in the intestine than in the stomach, which showed very little or no activity,61,62 and high trypsinogen mRNA expression levels were also found in the intestine of Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar),70 Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis)71 and pufferfish (Takifugu obscurus).72 Our RNA-Seq results suggest that both the intestine and rectum play major roles in hydrolysis and absorption of proteins in yellowtail. It should be noted that the gene expression of these proteolytic digestive enzymes was low in the intestine of one fish (Fig. 4). Calduch-Giner et al.58 suggested that fish intestine transcriptomes are not static, but change spatially, seasonally and with diet. Since the samples of GI tract examined were obtained from cultured yellowtail maintained under the same conditions and sampled at the same time, our study suggests that the expression of proteolytic enzymes also varies between individuals, and that such differences may cause different physiological conditions in individuals.Focussing on intestine-specific gene expression, three apolipoprotein genes, apolipo Eb (g15747), apolipo B-100 (g10622) and apolipo A-1 (g15231), were included in this cluster (Fig. 4). Apolipoproteins play a crucial role in lipid transport and uptake in vertebrates and are synthesized mainly in the intestine and liver of most teleosts.73–75 In addition, another intestine-specific gene, Type-4 ice-structuring protein LS-12 (AFP4; g15894), which was first isolated as an antifreeze protein from the serum of the longhorn sculpin (Myoxocephalus octodecimspinosis),76 may also play a role in lipid metabolism because it has an apolipoprotein A-II domain (InterPro: IPR006801). It has also been reported that the expression of the AFP4 gene was higher in the anterior-middle intestinal segments than the posterior segment in European seabass.58 In contrast to mammals, which use carbohydrates as their main energy source, most fish predominantly make use of lipids.77 Therefore, these apolipoproteins and AFP4 may play important roles in lipid metabolism in the yellowtail intestine. In addition to these lipid metabolism-related genes, an acidic mammalian chitinase (AMCase) gene (g23028) was found in the intestine-specific cluster (Fig. 4), and a higher expression of this gene in the anterior-middle intestinal area as opposed to posterior segments in European seabass has been found.58 In the mouse, acidic mammalian AMCase can act in digestion of chitin polymers even in the presence of pepsin C, trypsin and chymotrypsin.78 This enzyme also plays a critical role in the human immune response to pathogens.79 It should be noted that fish intestines function as immune barriers to pathogens80,81 and that fish apolipoproteins play a role in this immune function.82–84 Thus, AMCase and apolipoproteins may have roles not only in digestion and absorption but also in defense against intestinal pathogens. Four muscle-related genes, myosin-11 (g20983), desmin (g10938), actin (g20707) and filamin A (g9142) were highly expressed in the intestine (Fig. 4). The GO enrichment analysis (Fig. 3) also showed the over-representation of muscle-related GO terms in the intestine such as ‘cytoskeleton’ (GO: 0005856, 22 genes), ‘actin cytoskeleton’ (GO: 0015629, 13 genes) and ‘intermediate filament cytoskeleton’ (GO: 0045111, 6 genes). Recently, Abrams et al.85 reported that zebrafish myosin-11 (myh11) gene mutations affected intestinal motility. In addition, a collagen a-1(I) chain gene (g10729) was found in the intestine-specific expression cluster (Fig. 4), and its role in responding to stretching of foetal human intestinal smooth muscle cells has been investigated.86 Thus, these muscle-related genes of yellowtail may have functions related to intestinal motility. Grau et al.87 suggested the importance of intestinal motility for intestinal absorption in carnivorous fish with irregular intake of large quantities of food.The rectum of yellowtail is separated from the posterior region of the intestine by the ileo-rectal valve. As observed in the rectum of the greater amberjack,87 the mucosa are more deeply folded than in those of the intestine, and the rectum is also considered to play a role in absorption.87 The rectum-specific cluster included two cathepsin genes, cathepsin L1 (g24904) and cathepsin Z (g6016) (Fig. 4). Cathepsin L1 gene also showed a higher expression in the anterior segments than in the posterior segment of the intestinal tract in zebrafish64 and European seabass.58 Cathepsins are essential lysosomal proteolytic enzymes and the activity of cathepsin D has been shown to be involved primarily with the posterior intestine in rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss).69 However, little is known about the function of cathepsins in the fish rectum and studies are needed to elucidate their role in digestion and absorption processes. Two multiligand endocytic receptor genes, cubilin (g20710) and megalin (g13916), were also found as rectum-specific genes (Fig. 4), and each shown to mediate reabsorption of proteins and vitamins in mammals. The megalin/cubilin complex delivers its ligands (proteins and vitamins) to lysosomes, where all proteins are degraded, and the amino acids and vitamins returned to circulation.88,89 Two rectum-specific genes, deleted in malignant brain tumours 1 (DMBT1; g13722) and macrophage mannose receptor 1 (g428), are possibly involved in defense against bacterial pathogens.90,91 The gene (g9672) encoding a-N-acetylgalactosaminidase, a lysosomal glycohydrolase,92 was also specifically expressed in the rectum (Fig. 4), although the functions of this enzyme in the rectum are unknown.The results of GO enrichment analysis of highly expressed genes and cluster analysis of the DEGs together showed that the acid secretion-related genes and acid-activated protease (pepsinogen) genes were specifically expressed in the stomach, while the proteolytic digestive enzymes, trypsin, chymotrypsin and carboxypeptidase B, were highly and commonly expressed in the intestine and the rectum. In addition, the RNA-Seq also revealed differences in gene expression patterns between the intestine and the rectum. The possible lipid metabolism-related genes (apolipoproteins and AFP4) were specifically expressed in the intestine, while the genes involved in lysosomal digestive and reabsorption processes (cathepsins, cubilin and megalin), were specifically expressed in the rectum. These transcriptional signatures exhibit the main features of the digestive tract of carnivorous fishes, which possess higher proteolytic enzyme activities than herbivorous or omnivorous species,93,94 which in general exhibit higher a-amylase (carbohydrate enzyme) activities.95 It should be noted that two a-amylase genes (g13238 and g13239) were found in the yellowtail, but their expression was low or undetected in the three GI tissues. Efficiency of food absorption and conversion can depend on the availability of digestive enzymes.96 Thus, these findings suggest that proteolytic digestive enzymes play a key role in digestion and nutrient absorption in the yellowtail GI tract.3.4. Gene expression patterns of proteolytic digestive enzymesBecause the RNA-Seq results suggested the importance of proteolytic processes in the yellowtail GI tract, we further analysed the expression patterns of proteolytic digestive enzymes in yellowtail. In the yellowtail genome, we found 75 candidate genes for proteolytic digestive enzymes: five pepsinogens, 19 trypsinogens, four chymotrypsinogens, 11 elastases, seven carboxypeptidases (A and B), four aminopeptidase Ns, 19 cathepsins and six collagenases (Fig. 5A). The expressional percentages of these categories were expressed as TPM values for each tissue (Fig. 5B). The distribution patterns of these enzymes varied among the three tissues. In the stomach, the expressional percentage was almost entirely occupied by pepsinogen genes, which accounted for 99.9% of the total. Surprisingly, the expression percentage of pepsinogens accounted for 45.6–65.0% of the overall stomach transcriptome in three individuals. In the intestine, the transcript levels of trypsinogens were very high (58.9%), followed by chymotrypsinogens (15.4%), elastases (14.6%) and carboxypeptidases (6.4%). These gene expression patterns are correlated with the intestinal protease activity in carnivorous fish as observed in previous studies. Eshel et al.97 estimated that trypsin contributes to 40–50% of the overall protein digestion in carnivorous fish intestines. Furthermore, it has been reported that trypsin activity in carnivorous fish is about four times (3.9 times) that of chymotrypsin activity, a relationship that is reversed in omnivorous and herbivorous species.98 Similarly, the expressional percentage of trypsinogen genes in yellowtail showed about four times (3.8 times) that of chymotrypsinogen genes. Trypsinogen genes were also expressed at the highest levels in the rectum (36.6%), but the expressional percentage was lower than that of the intestine (58.9%). Alternatively, cathepsin genes showed a high transcript level in the rectum which accounted for 32.8%, the highest among the three tissues.

(A) The number of proteolytic digestive enzyme genes identified in the yellowtail genome. (B) Expressional percentages based on TPM values for different categories of proteolytic enzyme genes. The expression levels of individual genes in the highly expressed categories in each tissue are also shown in (C) pepsinogen genes in stomach, (D) trypsinogen genes in intestine and rectum and (E) cathepsin genes in the rectum. The amino acid sequence identities and similarities between these highly expressed genes can be found in Supplementary Fig. S4.To determine whether there are differential gene usages within each category of proteolytic digestive enzymes, we further analysed the expression levels of individual genes in the highly expressed categories in each tissue (Fig. 5B): pepsinogen genes in the stomach (Fig. 5C), trypsinogen genes in the intestine and rectum (Fig. 5D) and cathepsin genes in the rectum (Fig. 5E). This analysis revealed that individual gene expression levels are different for each enzyme. Of the five pepsinogen genes in the stomach, g23012 occupied 72.1% of the total expression value, followed by g6958 which accounted for 16.0% (Fig. 5C). In teleosts, two types of pepsinogen have been identified, pepsinogen A and pepsinogen C.99 Both g23012 and g6958 genes encode pepsinogen A, and the amino acid identity and similarity between these two sequences are 64.6 and 78.1%, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Of 19 trypsinogen genes, only three, g15220, g121 and g15219, accounted for >70% of the total in the intestine and rectum (Fig. 5D). Among them, g15220 showed about half of the total expression value in the intestine (46.9%) and rectum (51.7%). Based on amino acid sequence identities, most trypsins can be classified into three basic Groups I–III.100 g15220 and g15219 encode Trypsin I, and the amino acid identity and similarity between them was 84.3 and 92.6%, respectively. On the other hand, g121 encodes Trypsin III, and it has 69.0 and 82.7% amino acid identity and similarity with g15220, and 73.9 and 86.7% amino acid identity and similarity with g15219 (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Of 19 cathepsin genes in the rectum, the transcript levels of g24904 (cathepsin L1) were highest (40.5%), followed by g6016 (cathepsin Z, 29.3%) and g6015 (cathepsin Z, 18.2%). The protein homology values among them were low or showed no significant similarity (Supplementary Fig. S4C).Overall, these results suggest that most proteolytic digestion in the yellowtail is related to the expression of specific genes, despite the large number of proteolytic digestive enzyme genes in the genome (Fig. 5A). The highly expressed proteolytic digestive enzyme genes identified in this study may play a key role in digestion in adult yellowtail. This finding suggests that the identification of proteins digestible by the products of these genes may lead to a yellowtail feed formulation with enhanced digestibility. Lemeiux et al.96 reported that among the activities of a number of enzymes, trypsin alone showed a significant correlation with food conversion efficiency and growth rate in the carnivorous Atlantic cod. Furthermore, it has been demonstrated that trypsin isoforms showed differing substrate preferences and distinct catalytic properties.100,101 Therefore, further study of the substrate preferences of the products of the three highly expressed trypsinogen genes (g15220, g121 and g15219) may inform the makeup of yellowtail feed ingredients.This study has focussed on adult yellowtail, and the gene expression patterns for digestive enzymes may be different for larval stages.71 Studies of gene expression patterns for digestive enzymes in larval stages of yellowtail will inform the development of formulated diets for larvae of this species. In addition, the digestive systems of fish show numerous structural and functional adaptations to their feeding habits. Thus, the transcriptomes of digestive tissues in fish are considered highly species-specific,58 suggesting that transcriptome profiling of these tissues may be instructive for the development of fish feed for species of interest in the aquaculture industry.AvailabilityThe draft genome sequence of S. quinqueradiata was submitted to DDBJ under accession no.

IntroductionSmall RNA-mediated gene silencing is a gene regulatory system that is conserved in eukaryotes.1 Small RNAs are typically 20~24 nucleotides in length and play important roles in diverse biological processes, such as growth, development, hormone synthesis, and response to biotic/abiotic stresses.2–4 MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of small RNAs that act as gene regulators in plants and animals. In plants, miRNAs are generally 21 nucleotides in length and generated from hairpin-structured RNA precursors, processed by Dicer-like proteins (DCL). These miRNAs associate with Argonaute proteins to form the RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) and repress target genes via cleavage, which requires near-perfect base-pairing with targets.1The cleavage of transcripts by miRNAs, which are either 225,6 or 21 nucleotides in length and contain one7 or two target sites,8 can trigger the production of a secondary small RNA cluster. Secondary small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are derived from the cleaved transcripts, converted into dsRNA by suppressor of gene silencing 3 and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 6, and processed by DCL4/5 in a phased manner.9,10 Given the nature of their biogenesis, these siRNAs are called phased, secondary siRNA (phasiRNA). PhasiRNA is generally 21 nucleotides in length, and some phasiRNAs are incorporated into the RISC in the same manner as miRNA, leading to silencing of the target mRNA in cis or trans.9,11 Numerous plants, such as rice,12 Arabidopsis,8 alfalfa, and soybean,11 have tens to hundreds of phasiRNA-producing loci (PHAS loci) in their genome. PHAS loci could be protein-coding, or non-coding genes like the trans-acting siRNA-generating loci (TAS).10,13 A well-studied example of the TAS mechanism is the miR390-TAS3-ARF pathway, which is widely conserved in land plants.14 In this pathway, miR390 triggers the production of phasiRNAs from TAS3 transcripts, and these phasiRNAs regulate auxin response factor (ARF) genes in trans.Various studies have reported that plant miRNAs and phasiRNAs regulate the expression of a range of gene families,9,15–18 including those related to disease resistance. In plants, there are two layers of defense mechanisms. First, pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) recognize specific patterns called pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in pathogens, and induce defense responses (PAMP-triggered immunity, PTI). Second, the pathogens overcoming PTI secrete effectors, which are recognized by resistance proteins (R proteins) that induce a subsequent downstream defense response such as rapid and localized cell death (effector-triggered immunity, ETI).19 Previous studies reported that miRNAs such as those belonging to the miR482/2118 superfamily, miR6019, miR6024, and miR6027 regulate genes encoding nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins, which belong to a major gene family of R proteins.11,18,20,21 Furthermore, NLR gene family is one of the representative PHAS genes in a broad range of plant families, including Solanaceae, whose trigger is the miR482/2118 superfamily.11,18,20,21Recently, several studies investigated the evolution of miRNAs across plant lineages via comparative analysis.22,23 These studies revealed that the evolution and divergence of miRNAs are closely associated with genome duplication and evolution of their target genes. Especially, disease-resistance-related miRNAs, such as miR482 superfamily, were studied well in the aspect of co-evolution with target NLRs.18,24,25 Origination of disease-resistance-associated miRNAs is considered to result from tandem duplication of NLRs and these miRNAs have co-evolved with their target NLRs.18 Each plant species experienced divergent evolution of NLRs, therefore, the pool of disease-resistance-associated miRNAs is distinctive in each plant species.18,25Solanaceae includes many crops that are widely grown in the world, such as tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), potato (Solanum tuberosum), and pepper (Capsicum annuum). Among them, pepper is one of the economically important crops, widely used in food and medicine. Previously, we identified miRNAs and some of their targets through high-throughput sequencing in pepper.15 Another study identified that pepper miRNAs regulate transcription factors, which may play an important role in plant development, via a trans-omics approach.26 In addition, there is a study covering the evolutionary relationship of miR482/2118 superfamily and resistance genes in Solanaceae.24 However, there is no in-depth study that unravels the detailed functions and evolutionary history of pepper miRNAs.Here, to investigate functions of the pepper miRNAs, we conducted comparative analyses of miRNAs and their targets in pepper, tomato, and potato using degradome analysis. Interestingly, we found that previously identified,15 but not characterized miRNAs (miR-n026 and miR-n033) targeted genes involved in plant defense systems, in addition to several known miRNAs (e.g. miR482). Moreover, these miRNAs were identified as a trigger of phasiRNA biogenesis. Among them, the can-miR-n033 family targets many NLR genes and most of them belong to the subgroup that was highly duplicated in pepper. Performing a comparative analysis based on the estimated divergence times [Capsicum and Solanum: diverged 19 million years ago (mya); potato and tomato: diverged 8 mya],27 we inferred that the miR-n033 family existed in a common ancestor to pepper, tomato, and potato, and the miR-n033a acquired new targets in pepper, a result of NLR gene expansion in this species. This study could advance our understanding of the evolutionary relationship between miRNA and target genes, and target gene regulation by miRNAs and phasiRNAs in plant immunity.2. Materials and methods2.1. Exploration of miRNAs in pepper, tomato, and potatoPrecursor and mature miRNA sequences from pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), and potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) were identified from previous studies and online database (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).15,17,28–31 In addition, we identified additional miRNAs with their precursor using small RNA-Seq data and almost the same pipeline from our previous study.15 We excluded the expression cut-off (raw reads = 1000) from the previous pipeline to identify additional miRNAs in pepper.15 Some miRNAs with different ID, but having identical sequences among pepper, tomato, and potato were integrated into same ID. Genome sequences and gff files of pepper (v.1.55; http://peppergenome.snu.ac.kr/ (20 April 2018, date last accessed)), tomato (ITAG v.2.3; https://solgenomics.net/ (20 April 2018, date last accessed)), and potato (JGI v.4.03; https://genome.jgi.doe.gov/ (20 April 2018, date last accessed)) were used to locate miRNA loci. Visualization of chromosome location was implemented using in-house Perl scripts. Genomic synteny of miRNAs among Solanaceae was analysed by modified microsynteny-based method.32 In brief, miRNAs between those in pepper and those in tomato or potato were searched for the synteny test using BLASTN (e-value < 1e-05). Five upstream and five downstream flanking proteins of each miRNA gene were retrieved. Synteny of the flanking proteins was analysed by MCScanX with BLAST e-value cut-off < 1e-10.33 Microsynteny was defined as at least 2 out of 10 flanking proteins of a miRNA pair having synteny with that of tomato or potato. Chromosome rearrangement was not considered.2.2. Degradome sequencing analysisTo identify targets of miRNAs experimentally, pepper (C. annuum CM334), tomato (S. lycopersicum Heinz), and potato (S. tuberosum Phureja) were grown under standard conditions (27 °C/19 °C; 16 h light/8 h dark). Various tissues (leaves, roots, stems, green fruits, red fruits, tubers) were sampled and used for the degradome library. The degradome libraries were constructed and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq2000.34 From the raw sequencing data, adaptors were removed, and qualified reads that were 15–26 nucleotides in length were obtained. Among these, structural RNAs such as rRNAs, tRNAs, snRNAs, and snoRNAs were removed using BLASTN with default option against Rfam (http://rfam.xfam.org/ (20 April 2018, date last accessed)).35 Subsequently, repeats and transposons were also removed using the repeat database.36 Because UTR sequences have not been identified in pepper, transcripts were defined to coding sequence (CDS) and ±1 kb flanking sequences. Analysis of signal to noise was conducted using the CleaveLand4 pipeline.37 The cut-off for significant targets was a p-value = 0.05 or a score = 4. Significant targets were categorized into five classes according to CleaveLand. Target genes were annotated by a BLASTX search against the NR database and InterPro domains of target genes were analysed using Blast2go.382.3. Northern blot analysisTotal RNA was extracted from leaf of pepper, tomato, potato and Nicotiana benthamiana using TRI Reagent (Ambion). A total amount of 20 µg of RNA from leaves of each species was individually separated in a 15% UREA polyacrylamide gel, electrophoretically transferred to Hybond-NX membrane (GE Healthcare), and was chemical cross-linked via 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC).39 For labelling reaction of probes, 2 µl of 10 µM oligo, 2 µl of 10X T4 PNK buffer (Takara), 2.5 µl of [<U+03B3>-32P] ATP, >7000 Ci/mmole (~150 µCi/µl), 12.5 µl of dH2O, and 1 µl of T4 polynucleotide kinase (Takara) were added to a 20 µl reaction for 1 h at 37 °C. The labelled probes were further purified from unincorporated labels with PERFORMA Spin Columns (Edge Bio) according to the manufacturers’ instruction. Probe sequences used for northern blot analysis were sequences of the mature miRNAs in pepper (Supplementary Table S1). Hybridization and washing procedures were performed essentially as described.40 The membranes were exposed to a phosphorimager, and signals were analysed using BAS-2500 (Fuji).2.4. PhasiRNA analysisThe phasiRNA prediction pipeline was written in Python language. Same small RNA-Seq data, which were exploited to identify additional miRNAs in pepper, were used in phasiRNA analysis.15 Small RNA reads were processed to trim adapters, and low-quality reads were filtered and collapsed using the FASTX toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/ (20 April 2018, date last accessed)). Processed reads were aligned to the genomes of pepper, tomato, and potato using Bowtie-1.1.241 (-v 0 -a) and normalized by genome-mapped counts (hit normalize) to prevent overestimating reads that were mapped more than one time to the genome. The criteria to filter the mapped reads were as below. (1) Small RNA reads with abundance less than three were excluded because of computing difficulty. (2) The reads that were mapped to the genome more than 25 times were filtered. After filtering small RNA reads, a P-value was calculated to identify putative PHAS in the genome, filtering with P-value = 0.001, and phasing score was calculated in the expanded PHAS genes (-500 and +1000 bp) as the modified algorithm.42 The filtered PHAS genes, which had phasing scores of 15 or above, were regarded as PHAS genes. PHAS genes were characterized using gene annotation data (v.1.55; https://solgenomics.net/ (20 April 2018, date last accessed)). Furthermore, if they were not associated with non-coding RNAs such as rRNA, tRNA, and snRNA from the Rfam database,35 SILVA (https://www.arb-silva.de/ (20 April 2018, date last accessed)),43 plantRNA database (http://plantrna.ibmp.cnrs.fr/plantrna/ (20 April 2018, date last accessed)),44 and the genome database of each species (https://solgenomics.net/ (20 April 2018, date last accessed)), they were selected for further analysis. PHAS genes were identified with respect to whether miRNAs trigger the production of phasiRNA by degradome analysis via CleaveLand4.37 To predict the target sites of the phasiRNAs, phasiRNAs from the PHAS regions were analysed using CleaveLand4 as the input.37 Phased loci were visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV).452.5. Bioinformatic analysis for miR-n026 and miR-n033, and motif analysis targeted by miRNAsGenome sequences and gff files of pepper, tomato, and potato were used for location of miRNAs. Syntenic relationships between pepper, tomato, and potato genes that flank miRNA sequences were confirmed by MCScanX (BLASTP e-value < 1e-10).33 To examine whether miR-n026 and miR-n033 exist in Solanaceous species, an analysis was conducted using BLASTN with default option against their genome. We referred to evolutionary distances between Solanaceous species from other studies.46,47 The hairpin structures of miR-n026 and miR-n033 were predicted using the RNAfold web server.48 Transposable elements were found as described in a previous study.49 Subgroups of target NLRs in pepper, tomato, and potato were classified according to a previous study.50 The sequences targeted by each miRNA were translated considering the frame and aligned using Clustal Omega.51 The aligned sequences were used to create consensus sequences using WebLogo (http://weblogo.threeplusone.com/ (20 April 2018, date last accessed)).52 Target prediction of miR-n026 and miR-n033 was conducted using psRNAtarget (score = 3.5; http://plantgrn.noble.org/psRNATarget/ (20 April 2018, date last accessed)).53 The phylogenetic tree of NLRs was from our previous study.503. Results3.1. Solanaceae miRNA genes are unevenly distributed with clusters on chromosomesTo perform comprehensive analysis of miRNAs in Solanaceae, the genomic locations of miRNA genes were investigated. Because pre-existing studies identified miRNAs in pepper, tomato, and potato, we used the sequences of miRNAs and their precursors from the literature and databases.15,17,28–31 In the case of pepper, we identified additional miRNAs based on data from our previous study because we had applied strict criteria to identify novel miRNAs, which could cause false negative.15 We collected 145, 123, and 275 mature miRNAs, including those from guide and passenger strand, from the 223, 93, and 393 miRNA genes in pepper, tomato, and potato, respectively (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). We defined species-specific miRNAs as the miRNAs, whose mature and precursor sequences are not overlapped with those of other species in this study and in miRBase using BLASTN with default option (Supplementary Table S3). These genes were classified into 93, 58, and 126 families, respectively, and only 28 conserved families were shared among the three plants, suggesting the rapid divergence of miRNA genes after divergence of the lineages (Supplementary Fig. S1). Although the number of conserved miRNA families is lower than that of species-specific miRNA families (Supplementary Fig. S1), the number of conserved miRNA genes comprises more than half of the total miRNA genes, indicating that there are more members in each conserved miRNA family than in each species-specific miRNA family (Supplementary Table S3).We explored the genomic location of miRNAs in three Solanaceous species, and the 198, 93, and 388 miRNA genes out of 223, 93, and 393 miRNA genes were mapped onto the chromosomes of pepper, tomato, and potato, respectively (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. S2, and Table S4). The number of mapped miRNA genes is discordant with the number of miRNA genes because some scaffolds which have miRNA genes were not mapped onto the chromosomes. The genes were not evenly distributed on the 12 chromosomes. We found some clusters of well-conserved miRNA genes in pepper, tomato, and potato. For example, nine miRNA genes producing can-miR169a-g were located on chromosome 7 within 1.9 Mb of each other (Fig. 1). Tomato and potato have similar clusters of miR169 on chromosome 7, although the numbers of miRNAs were different (Supplementary Fig. S2). Therefore, duplication of miR169 on chromosome 7 might have occurred before the divergence of the lineages leading to pepper, tomato, and potato. To perform in-depth analysis, we conducted microsynteny analysis on the miRNA genes and their flanking protein-coding sequences, focusing on pepper. Among 126 conserved mapped miRNA genes in pepper, 77 miRNA genes have at least 2 out of 10 flanking proteins showing synteny with that of tomato or potato, and 51 miRNA genes have more than five flanking proteins with synteny. These results indicate that synteny of many conserved miRNAs in pepper (Capsicum spp.) is stably maintained after the divergence of the lineages to tomato/potato (Solanum spp.; Fig. 1). However, some of the conserved miRNAs do not show synteny in all three species, indicating the evolution of those miRNAs after the divergence of the lineages. For example, can-miR482f and can-miR482d are closely located within a 73 kb region on chromosome 4 (Fig. 1), but only miRNA gene sequence of can-miR482f was similar to those in tomato and potato. Meanwhile, we found some clusters that consist of various miRNAs from different miRNA families. For example, there is a clustered region that contains four miRNA genes (miR-n033a, miR-n102, miR-n033b, and miR6027) on chromosome 10 (Fig. 1). Additionally, there are five miRNA genes (miR-n026, miR-n073, miR6023, miR-n036, and miR-n045) in the clustered region of chromosome 12, but their precursor sequences are not related, and therefore they might have evolved independently. Together, these findings indicate that miRNA genes have undergone dynamic evolution in pepper. Genome-wide distribution of miRNA genes in pepper. Black boxes indicate 12 pseudomolecules of pepper. miRNA genes in black and red indicate the location of conserved and pepper-specific miRNA families, respectively.

Degradome analysis revealed that miRNAs are involved in disease-resistance in SolanaceaeTo identify targets of miRNAs on a genome-wide level, miRNA-cleaved target libraries from pooled tissues (leaves, roots, stems, green fruits, red fruits, and tubers) of pepper, tomato, and potato were generated (see Materials and methods section). Sequencing of Parallel Analysis of RNA Ends (PARE) libraries, also known as degradome libraries, identifies the remnants of small RNA-directed target cleavage globally by sequencing the 5' ends of uncapped RNAs.54,55 A total of 251,689,162 sequencing reads in pepper, 226,553,118 in tomato, and 371,124,547 in potato were obtained from degradome sequencing (Supplementary Table S5). After removing low-quality or structural RNA reads, 151,815,030, 103,905,693, and 269,954,139 final reads were used for processing and 55.3%, 61.63%, and 73.96% of the reads were mapped to the transcripts of pepper, tomato, and potato, respectively (Supplementary Table S5). The target genes were identified using the CleaveLand4 pipeline.37A total of 436, 352, and 169 pairs of miRNAs/target genes were identified in pepper, tomato, and potato, respectively. Among these, 99, 72, and 70 miRNAs targeted at least one gene, according to a pre-set standard (e-value = 0.05 or score = 4), respectively (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S6). Regarding target genes, 390, 319, and 163 genes were targeted by miRNAs from pepper, tomato, and potato, respectively (Supplementary Table S6). In the case of potato, the total degradome reads are high, but the results might have been underestimated because of the low number of unique reads (Supplementary Table S5). In summary, we found consistent results among targets of conserved miRNAs with the previous study. We confirmed that can-miR396b, can-miR396c, and sly-miR39b targeted domain-rearranged methyltransferase (DRM) gene as validated previously (Supplementary Table S6).15 To explore the targets of miRNAs, we analysed the domains of the target genes (Fig. 2B). We found that a large number of the target genes have the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) and nucleotide-binding (NB) domains shared by APAF-1, R genes, and CED-4 (NB-ARC) in Solanaceae. In particular, pepper had 115 target genes containing the LRR domain; this number is much higher than that in tomato or potato (Fig. 2B). The majority of these NLRs in pepper, tomato, and potato were regulated by conserved miRNAs (miR482 family, miR6024, and miR6027; Supplementary Table S6). Among these, miR6024 and miR6027 were only identified in some Solanaceous species20 but miR482 family exists in many plants18. Although miR6024 and miR6027 are relatively young miRNAs compared with miR482, they also regulate many NLRs in the three species. The second most abundant domain was transcription factors. Specifically, the majority of conserved miRNA targets included transcription factors such as Teosinte Branched 1, Cycloidea, and PCF (TCP), ARF, and MYB. Degradome analysis in Solanaceous species.

NB-ARC: nucleotide-binding domain shared by APAF-1, resistance genes, and CED-4; TCP: teosinte branched1, cycloidea.We analysed the target genes of species-specific miRNAs in detail (Table 1). In results, we found that many pepper-specific miRNAs had no identified target genes based on degradome analysis. These results are consistent with previous findings that miRNAs have evolved neutrally, so most young miRNAs, which are species-specific, do not have target genes or functions.56,57 On the other hand, some of pepper-specific miRNAs target multiple genes, encoding NLRs, receptor-like proteins (RLPs), accelerated cell death proteins, and F-box proteins. These genes are mostly involved in plant defense mechanisms.58,59 For example, both can-miR-n002a-c and can-miR-n005a-5p target three F-box proteins (Supplementary Table S6). Especially, can-miR-n033a and can-miR-n026 targeted 31 NLRs and 17 RLPs, respectively. In general, only miRNAs which are well-conserved throughout various plant species, such as miR482, have a number of target genes.57 In contrast, most of young miRNAs are weakly expressed and have few target genes.15,57,60,61 However, miR-n026 and miR-n033 were observed to target a number of genes despite their short evolutionary history, indicating their potential role in plant defense. In addition, we found that representative examples of cleaving disease-resistance genes by both conserved miRNAs (miR482, miR6024, and miR6027) and pepper-specific miRNAs (miR-n033a and miR-n026) seems evident in degradome analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3). It supported our hypothesis about the significance of pepper-specific miRNAs in regulation of pepper disease-resistance. Degradome targets by pepper-specific miRNAs in pepper (Capsicum annuum)and are different from each other.Degradome targets by pepper-specific miRNAs in pepper (Capsicum annuum)and are different from each other.3.3. Small RNA clusters and phasiRNAs are also associated with disease-resistance in pepperRecent studies reported that some miRNAs can produce secondary small RNAs, such as phasiRNA, to regulate a more extensive set of transcripts.11,21,42 Exploiting small RNA libraries from the previous study,15 we performed genome-wide analysis in pepper to identify putative PHAS loci using modified computational algorithms with a stringent threshold, P-value = 0.001.42,62 As a result, we found 31 protein-coding PHAS loci (Table 2). Several gene families were identified as putative PHAS loci, such as NLR, RLP, nuclear transcription factor Y, and transport inhibitor response 1-like (TIR1-like) protein. Most of these protein-coding PHAS genes have been reported in other plant species,11,42,63 indicating a conserved mechanism of phasiRNA biogenesis in various plants. However, another well-conserved phasiRNA gene, TAS, was not identified in our results. Interestingly, most PHAS loci are associated with disease resistance. These include 20 NLRs, 8 RLPs, and 1 TIR1-like protein, which are believed to be involved in ETI and PTI in plants.58Genes producing phasiRNA cluster by miRNAs in pepper (Capsicum annuum)and are different from each other.Genes producing phasiRNA cluster by miRNAs in pepper (Capsicum annuum)and are different from each other.We identified triggers of phasiRNA biogenesis with degradome analysis using CleaveLand437 (Table 2). Most miRNA triggers of phasiRNA biogenesis in pepper were 22 nucleotides in length, with the exception of can-miR169a-g and can-miR171i, which were 20 and 21 nucleotides in length respectively, consistent with previous studies (Supplementary Table S1).6,11,42 Members of the miR482 family are known as phasiRNA triggers, suggesting amplification of NLR regulation to extensively control disease resistance.11,21 miR6027 also represses NLRs, as in the case of miR482, and also plays a role in phasiRNA biogenesis.20,64 We determined that miR482 and miR6027 initiated phasiRNA biogenesis by cleaving NLRs in pepper (Supplementary Figs S4 and S5). One of the target genes of can-miR482c is coiled-coil NLR (CNL, CA05g06820), and a detailed mapping profile of small RNA and degradome reads demonstrated that the can-miR482c cleavage site in CA05g06820 corresponds to the 21-nucleotide phasing window (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Likewise, other variants of the miR482 family (can-miR482b, d, and f) were also identified as phasiRNA triggers (Supplementary Table S7). can-miR6027-3p targets another CNL (CA04g14510) and induces phasiRNA biogenesis (Supplementary Fig. S5A). However, another miRNA-targeting NLR, miR6024, was not identified as a phasiRNA trigger in pepper. Previous studies revealed that miR6024 acts as a trigger of phasiRNA biogenesis, by targeting the I2 gene in tomato and Rx1 gene in potato.20,65 The length of miR6024 is 22 nucleotides in tomato and potato, but 21 nucleotides in pepper (Supplementary Table S1). Because phasiRNA triggers are typically 22 nucleotides in length,9 can-miR6024-derived phasiRNA biogenesis might not occur in pepper. can-miR393a-b is another conserved miRNA that regulates TIR1-like genes and has been reported as a phasiRNA trigger in soybean, where it is closely linked with the basal defense response.66 It was also identified as a phasiRNA trigger in pepper (Supplementary Table S7); it is therefore likely to be associated with the basal defense response in pepper. We found that pepper-specific miRNAs also induce phasiRNA biogenesis. can-miR-n033 cleaves four NLRs and produces phasiRNA clusters (Supplementary Fig. S6A). In addition, we found that can-miR-n026 triggered phasiRNA production by cleavage of eight RLPs (Table 2; Fig. 3A). Interestingly, all the PHAS loci targeted by pepper-specific miRNAs are associated with disease-resistance. can-miR-n026 induces phasiRNA biogenesis by cleaving RLP.

Additionally, can-miR-n026 cleaved an RLP (CA08g01140), with results similar to that of can-miR482c (Fig. 3B and C). Similar findings were also observed with can-miR-n033a and CA06g02150, except that there was no trans-acting phasiRNA (Supplementary Fig. S6B). These results are consistent with previous observations of cis- or trans-acting of phasiRNAs.113.4. Evolution of miRNAs related to defense mechanism in pepperWe found that several miRNAs in pepper targeted many genes-encoding defense-related proteins, such as NLRs and RLPs. In addition, some of the targeted genes produced secondary small RNAs, indicating they might have important roles in plant immunity. Then, we validated expression of the several disease-resistance related miRNAs in leaves of pepper, tomato, potato, and Nicotiana benthamiana via northern blot (Supplementary Fig. S7). We identified that can-miR-n033a-3p and can-miR-n026 were only expressed in pepper and can-miR6027 was expressed in pepper, tomato, and potato. It is consistent with the previous results that can-miR-n033a-3p and can-miR-n026 are pepper-specific miRNAs15 and miR6027 is conserved in tomato and potato.20 However, miR6023 was only expressed in pepper, even though it is also known as a conserved miRNA in tomato and potato (Supplementary Fig. S7).20 The mature sequence for miR6027 is identical across all three species, while miR6023 is polymorphic, which could cause disruption of probe hybridization (Supplementary Table S1). After validating expression of disease-resistance-related miRNAs, we tried to validate the target cleavage by disease-resistance-related miRNAs, especially can-miR-n033a and miR-n026, via 5' RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RLM-RACE) assay. However, we could not clone the target NLRs and RLPs because of their high redundancy. Although we got negative results in 5' RLM-RACE assay, we got quite significant results in degradome analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3) and there are other studies that validated miRNA-derived cleavage through degradome analysis alone,11,67 therefore, we regarded that disease-resistance-related miRNAs in our study are still reliable and conducted further analyses.We examined whether genes of miR-n033 and miR-n026 only exist in pepper using BLASTN. We found that homologous regions are located on the intergenic region of chromosome 10 and 12, respectively (Fig. 4). The genes flanking these regions were conserved in tomato and potato. The hairpin sequence of miR6027 was conserved among the three species and can-miR-n033a and can-miR-n033b were located near miR6027 (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, we found candidates of miR-n033a and miR-n033b in potato, which were not annotated previously. Still, there was no similar sequence in tomato (Fig. 4A). In particular, miR-n033b and miR6027 might share the same precursor in pepper and potato, and their precursor sequences are well-conserved (Supplementary Fig. S8A and B). We also confirmed that miR-n033b is expressed in potato using public small RNA sequencing data17,30 (Supplementary Fig. S8E). In the case of miR-n033a, it is also well-conserved in pepper and potato, but it does not exist in tomato (Supplementary Fig. S9). In addition, the length of the intergenic region was ca. 46 kb in pepper, whereas it was 4.2 kb and 3.6 kb in tomato and potato, respectively. The intergenic region was 10 times more expanded and contained the LTR gypsy element in pepper. This may indicate a complex evolutionary history in that region in pepper, tomato, and potato. To identify whether miR-n033 regions were lost in tomato, we examined that miR-n033 regions exist in other Solanaceous species [eggplant (Solanum melongena L.),68,Petunia axillaris,27 and Nicotiana benthamiana46] using BLASTN. We found that homologous region of miR-n033a is well-conserved in them, and that of miR-n033b is only conserved in Capsicum and Solanum species (Supplementary Fig. S10). These observations indicate that miR-n033 genes originated in a common ancestor of pepper, tomato, and potato, and then lost in tomato. In the case of miR-n026, the flanking genes were conserved and the length of the intergenic region was not different among pepper, tomato, and potato (Fig. 4B). We found that homologous region of miR-n026 exists in the three species (not annotated previously in tomato and potato), but the precursor sequence of can-miR-n026 is different from those in tomato and potato (Supplementary Fig. S11A–C). miR6023 and miR-n026 might be generated from the same precursor in tomato and potato, but from distinct precursors in pepper (Fig. 4B). This might result from either a pepper-specific translocation of the miR6023 region from the miR-n026 region, or a translocation of the miR6023 region to the miR-n026 region in an ancestor of Solanum species after the divergence of the lineage to pepper. Although hairpin structure of miR-n026 is different between pepper and Solanum species, we confirmed the expression of miR-n026 candidates in tomato and potato using public small RNA libraries.17,30,69,70 Thus, miR-n033 and miR-n026 regions showed the dynamic nature of the evolution, even in syntenic regions.

Different target affinity of miR-n033 between pepper and potatoIn a previous study, we classified NLRs into 13 subgroups, including 12 CNL types and 1 toll interleukin 1 receptor NLR (TNL) type, based on the phylogeny of NB-ARC domains.50 To perform in-depth analysis of NLR-regulating miRNAs, we analysed subgroups of the target genes. Interestingly, most target genes of can-miR-n033a-3p and can-miR-n033b-3p belong to the CNL-G1 subgroup of CNL (Fig. 5A), which is expanded subgroup since the divergence of pepper from Solanum spp. The duplication events of CNL-G1 peaked at 10 mya.50 Therefore, these miRNAs might have got or reinforced their affinity for CNL-G1 since the divergence of pepper from Solanum spp. This result may indicate that the miR-n033 family has evolved to regulate a number of NLR genes that have recently been duplicated. To investigate how these miRNAs could regulate multiple targets, we identified the region of the NLR targeted by each miRNA (Fig. 5B). The target site of can-miR-n033-3p at the NLR genes was different from that of other NLR-targeting miRNAs with the exception of miR6027. can-miR-n033a-3p and can-miR-n33b-3p targeted nucleotides encoding the resistance nucleotide binding site (RNBS)-D motif of the NB domain, whereas the can-miR482 family and can-miR6024 targeted the P-loop motif (Fig. 5B). We also analysed RLPs targeted by can-miR-n026 using the same approach, but the RLPs could not be classified as subgroups due to sequence variation. Nevertheless, the target regions of miR-n026 and miR6023, leucine-rich repeat N-terminal domain (LRRNT), are conserved (Fig. 5C). Group-specific NLR targets in pepper (Capsicum annuum).

To examine whether difference exists in target affinity of these miRNAs between three species, we extracted candidate sequences of miR-n026 and miR-n033 in tomato and potato, and compared their target NLRs and RLPs in pepper, tomato, and potato. Because of the different depths of the degradome data, we exploited a target prediction program, psRNAtarget, to compare the target genes of miRNAs (score = 3.5).53 Remarkably, can-miR-n033a-3p was predicted to target more NLRs in CNL-G1 group (37, 32%), whereas can-miR-n033b-3p, stu-miR-n033a-3p, and stu-miR-n033b-3p were predicted to target less those (19, 16%; 16, 44% and 12, 33%, respectively; Table 3). It suggests that only can-miR-n033a-3p acquired an ability to target more NLRs which were expanded in pepper, and small portion of expanded NLRs in CNL-G1 group was targeted by can-miR-n033a-3p. We investigated NLRs in CNL-G1 targeted by miR-n033 to answer how can-miR-n033a-3p could get more affinity than other miR-n033s. It might result from the expansion of NLRs in CNL-G1 group of pepper (Fig. 6B).50 The mature miR-n033 sequences are different in these species (Fig. 6A). In addition, the consensus sequences of the CNL-G1 targeted by miR-n033a-3p different between pepper and potato, and these different sequences are corresponded with the sequences which are different between can-miR-n033a-3p and stu-miR-n033a-3p (Fig. 6C). Possible scenario is as described below: (1) miR-n033 genes existed in a common ancestor of pepper, tomato, and potato (Supplementary Fig. S10) and they had a function to regulate CNL-G1; (2) after pepper diverged from the ancestor (19 mya), CNL-G1 in pepper were highly duplicated (Fig. 6B) and it caused diversification of CNL-G1; (3) can-miR-n033a-3p evolved to regulate more CNL-G1 by mutation (Fig. 6A, C and Table 3). Therefore, it might reinforce the affinity of can-miR-n033a-3p for CNL-G1. In the case of stu-miR-n033b-3p, it was predicted to target more NLRs in CNL-G9 group (18) than can-miR-n033a-3p (6), can-miR-n033b-3p (3), and stu-miR-n033a-3p (3). Because, the number of NLRs in CNL-G9 group is slightly different between pepper (73) and potato (55),50 the difference of target affinity might come from mutation of stu-miR-n033b-3p. can-miR-n026 has many predicted target RLPs, but miR-n026 in tomato and potato has few predicted target RLPs (Supplementary Table S8), and their mature sequences are different, similar to the case of miR-n033 (Supplementary Fig. S13). The differences in targeting affinity between miR-n026s might be the result from mutation of miRNAs and/or expansion of target genes.

In this study, we performed a comparative genome-wide analysis of miRNAs and their targets in pepper, tomato, and potato. Many of the miRNAs are conserved and share conserved targets and genomic synteny in plants. In three Solanaceous species, we observed similar patterns. However, some miRNAs, such as miR482d, have evolved in a species-specific manner, even in closely related species.Degradome analysis provides valuable information to understand the genome-wide targets of miRNAs. In this study, we found consistent results among targets of conserved miRNAs. We confirmed a previous observation that the conserved miR396 targeted DRM, which is found exclusively in pepper and tomato,15 via degradome analysis (Supplementary Table S6). In addition, a number of target genes of miRNAs were classified as being involved in the defense response. Previous studies reported that some conserved miRNAs appear to be involved in defense mechanisms, both PTI and ETI. In Arabidopsis, PAMP induces the accumulation of miR393, which targets F-box auxin receptors, TIR1, and auxin signaling F-box protein 2 and 3.71 Suppression of auxin signalling by miR393 might result in enhanced PTI. In addition, miR160a-targeted ARFs positively regulated callose deposition induced by PAMP like flg22.72 miRNAs play roles in PTI via regulation of hormone signalling, but they also target NLR genes for ETI. For example, miR1507, miR2109, and miR2118 target several hundred NLR genes in Medicago truncatula.11,73 In Solanaceous species—such as tomato, potato, and N. benthamiana—miR482, miR5300, miR6019, and miR6027 were identified to target NLR genes.20,21 In addition, some miRNAs targeting NLRs can trigger the production of phasiRNA to regulate NLRs. For example, three 22-nucleotide miRNAs (miR2118, miR2109, and miR1507) target conserved domains of NLRs and initiate the production of phasiRNAs in legume.11 In N. benthamiana, two miRNAs (nta-miR6019 and nta-miR6020) target the region of the TIR domain in the N gene, and overexpression of these miRNAs attenuate N-mediated resistance to TMV.20In this study, we found that several miRNAs targeted NLRs and RLPs in pepper. Species-specific miRNAs are considered to have evolved recently,74 and show lower expression levels than those of conserved miRNAs, or are expressed in specific condition.75 In a similar context, many species-specific miRNAs have few target genes, because they evolved neutrally.75 However, can-miR-n033 and can-miR-n026 were each found to target a number of NLRs and RLPs (Table 1), even though they are thought to have evolved recently. In addition, they produce phasiRNAs and regulate the transcripts of NLRs or RLPs in cis or trans manners (Supplementary Fig. S6 and Fig. 3). This indicates that miRNAs and phasiRNAs could regulate a large number of genes involved in defense systems and might have long-term benefits for R gene evolution. For example, NLRs usually induce disease resistance through a hypersensitive cell death response (HR) to infection.76 Several studies exhibited that some NLRs could induce HR in the host without pathogen.77–79 Therefore, if NLRs are not properly regulated, this could result in significant fitness costs in the host plants.80 Consequently, miRNAs regulating NLRs might have evolved to regulate a number of NLRs through the production of phasiRNAs.9,21 It might alleviate the possible problems due to rapid evolution of R genes, such as unexpected HR. Thus, miRNAs and phasiRNAs might facilitate divergent evolution of R genes.It is known that hundreds of NLRs are present in plant genomes. NLRs might have evolved during an arms race with pathogens. As mentioned above, constant expression of NLRs and overactive immune systems can be harmful to plants with respect to fitness costs.80 For example, a dominant mutant suppressor of npr1-1, constitutive 1, a TNL type gene, shows constitutive activation of defense without pathogen perception, and the resulting phenotype was dwarfed with curly leaves in Arabidopsis.81,82 Therefore, plants should control the expression of NLRs during the absence of pathogens, and fine tuning of NLR expression is important. In this study, we showed that miR-n033 regulates a number of NLR genes in pepper and potato via degradome analysis and target prediction (Table 1). Among them, there are many CNL-G1 NLRs, which belong to a subgroup that is expanded specifically in pepper (Figs 5 and 6),50 whereas many CNL-G9 NLRs are predicted targets of stu-miR-n033b-3p in potato (Table 3). This indicates the divergent evolution of miRNA and their target NLRs in the different species. However, few NLRs in CNL-G2 were found to be targets of miRNAs, although this group was also expanded like CNL-G1 in pepper.50 Because degradome analysis was performed with tissues in normal conditions, more miRNAs targeting NLRs could be identified via miRNA profiling and degradome analysis under pathogen challenge.We also found that miR-n026 targets RLP genes. There are few studies about miRNA regulation of RLP genes. A previous study reported that the conserved sly-miR6022 and sly-miR6023 cleaved Hcr9, a tomato Cf-9 homolog, which is the target of miR-n026.20 Furthermore, the targeting of other RLPs by sly-miR6022 was verified via degradome analysis in tomato fruit.83 Cf-9 genes confer resistance against Cladosporium fulvum by recognition of pathogen-derived avirulence determinants.84 In that case, necrosis in a host containing Cf-9 was observed to occur during infection by C. fulvum race 5. This suggests the important function of Hcr9 in disease resistance. In another case, an RLP kinase, CaLRR51, was found to play a role in the response of pepper to infection by Ralstonia solanacearum. Moreover, the transient overexpression of CaLRR51 resulted in HR-like cell death responses, indicating the necessity of strict regulation of RLPs.85 We observed in this study that miR-n026 cleaved some Hcr9 genes in pepper (Table 2), and that there are few predicted RLP targets in potato and tomato (Supplementary Table S8). Therefore, RLP-targeting miRNAs in pepper appear to have evolved with their targets to acquire the function of regulating RLPs in order to avoid damage due to unexpected resistance responses. It is possible that other regulatory pathways exist to compensate for the absence of miR-n026 function in tomato and potato.We regarded that miR-n033 and miR-n026 are pepper-specific miRNAs, but we found homologous sequences of them, and their hairpin structures are also conserved in tomato and potato. However, miR-n033 and miR-n026 were not identified previously in tomato and potato. There are several possibilities that could explain why miR-n033 and miR-n026 were not identified in tomato and potato. First, when we examined their expression in tomato and potato using public small RNA libraries, we merged all libraries from several studies17,30,69,70 for each species. Therefore, expression of miR-n026 and miR-n033 in tomato and potato are too low to be identified as miRNA in the other studies. Also, it might explain why we could not identify miR-n026 and miR-n033 in potato and tomato via northern blot. We extracted total RNA only from leaf in a normal condition, and it is possible that miR-n026 and miR-n033 in tomato and potato were not expressed in that tissue or condition. Second, in the case of miR-n033b and miR-n026, they are generated from the same precursor with miR6027 and miR6023, respectively, so miR-n033b and miR-n026 might be omitted, because the probability that a precursor has two entirely different mature miRNAs is not considered generally. Third, length of the miR-n026 and miR-n033 precursors in tomato and potato is quite long (>200 nt), then it is hard to identify them with general criteria for identification of miRNA. Because of these possibilities, miR-n026 and miR-n033 in tomato and potato require experimental validation for further study.5. ConclusionIn this study, we systematically investigated the evolutionary patterns of miRNAs and their targets. Our analysis revealed that some miRNAs in pepper mainly targeted genes encoding defense-related proteins. We found that miR-n026 and miR-n033 target a number of NLRs and RLPs in pepper.

IntroductionA typical mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) consists of a circular DNA, which encodes ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs), transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and a subset of proteins that are exclusively used by mitochondrion.1 Defect in these genes causes severe diseases.2 These elements are usually located on two separate DNA strands. Unlike eukaryotic nuclear genes that contain exon(s), intron(s), untranslated region (UTR) and independent regulatory regions, mtDNA-encoded genes are usually transcribed into a polycistronic transcript before they are punctuated into individual transcripts.3 Therefore, these genes do not contain their own regulatory sequence and UTR and carry few intergenic sequences.4 One of the most sizable non-coding regions (NCRs) is the D-loop that is found across species and has been proposed to function as a start site for DNA replication and transcription. In addition to the D-loop, species- or population-specific NCRs have also been identified across species.5 Given the highly compact configuration of mitochondrial genes, determination of the origin and function of these poorly conserved NCRs is critical for understanding the evolution and regulation of mtDNA.The nematode genus Caenorhabditis is an excellent model for studying the NCR biogenesis and function because species- or strain-specific NCRs have already been documented in this genus. In addition to the D-loop, all the currently available Caenorhabditis mtDNAs share another NCR, which is approximately 100 bp in length and is located between the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 4 (ND4) and cyclooxygenase (COX1) genes.6–8 An NCR with similar sequence is also present in the Pristionchus pacificus mtDNA, albeit with a reduced length of 51 bp.9 This NCR was postulated to be another mtDNA replication origin aside from the D-loop.9,10 With the exception of the two relatively conserved NCRs, other NCRs have also been documented occasionally. For example, in addition to the two relatively conserved NCRs, C. briggsae carries another one or two NCR(s) in a strain-dependent manner.6,7,C. sinica also carries an extra NCR.6 Comparative and functional genomics study of the mitochondria from more related Caenorhabditis species is valuable for understanding NCR evolution and function. We referred to the available nematode mtDNA that can and cannot be rendered circular as complete and partial genome, respectively. Partial or complete mtDNA have been reported for five Caenorhabditis species (Table 1), including C. elegans,11,C. briggsae,8,C. nigoni,12,C. tropicalis13 and C. sinica.6 Unlike mtDNAs in mammals and other species that encodes 13 proteins on two separate DNA strands,4 all the existing Caenorhabditis mtDNAs encode 12 proteins on a single strand along with two rRNAs (12S and 16S) and 22 tRNAs, all of which are presumably transcribed as a single unit followed by punctuation into individual transcript as those in human.11,C. briggsae mtDNA usually carries four NCRs arranged in a clockwise order, i.e. a D-loop, a pseudo ND5-1 located between ND2 and CYTB, a shared NCR mentioned above and a pseudo-ND5-2. To facilitate the comparison of NCRs across species, we referred to the four as NCR1, NCR2, NCR3 and NCR4, respectively. We named the NCR in other species in the similar way based their location in respective mtDNA regardless of their sequence homology. The NCR2 is present in C. sinica but not in C. nigoni, the sister species of C. briggsae,7 indicating its fast turnover rate.

The availability of genomic data and mRNA-sequencing (mRNA-Seq) data creates an opportunity to generate and annotate mtDNA in these species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Data sourcesThe NGS genomic sequencing data for the mtDNA assembly were downloaded from NCBI SRA website. The details of each data source were listed in Supplementary Table S1. Also listed in the table are the data sources for the mRNA sequencing from mix-staged worms that were used for nuclear gene annotation here (see below). The mRNA sequencing data for L4/young adult worms were produced by the following three research projects which were used for quantifying abundance of mitochondrial gene transcripts. RNA-Seq data for C. elegans fog-2 (q71) mutant pseudo-females/males, C. briggsae she-1 (v47) mutant pseudo-females/males, and C. remanei, C. brenneri and C. japonica wild-type males/females were downloaded from GSE41367.16 RNA-Seq data for C. elegans and P. pacificus wild-type hermaphrodites/males were downloaded from GSE53144.17 RNA-Seq data for C. briggsae wild-type hermaphrodites/males and C. nigoni females/males were generated in our previous study, GSE76306.182.2. Mitochondrial DNA assembly and annotationAttempt to mtDNA assembly was first made using various existing mtDNA DNA assembly pipelines, including MITObim, NOVOPlasty and ARC.19,20 However, the NGS data for Caenorhabditis species were generated using different sequencing platforms with various read characteristics (Supplementary Table S1). Only relatively small contigs could be assembled. In addition, the annotation steps were not incorporated into these packages. Consequently, a third party webserver, Dogma21 and MITOS,22 for example, is required to generate annotation for mtDNA. Therefore, a computational pipeline customized for Caenorhabditis mtDNA assembly and annotation was devised to accommodate all data sources described above.A pipeline for mtDNA assembly and annotation was designed as shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. First, the average read coverage was roughly calculated through dividing the total number of nucleotides by a genome size of 100 Mb. The algorithm works by automatically fetching mitochondrion-specific sequencing reads from an NGS data archive with BWA-MEM23 using the mtDNA of a closely related species as a reference index. The fetched reads, together with their pair-end partners, were used to assemble contigs with Spades assembler.24 The contigs were then filtered by read coverage, only those with a 10-times higher coverage than the average read coverage would be chosen for subsequent analysis. And the filtered contigs were then added to the reference index to be used for the next round of sequence fetching. The process was reiterated till the possible mitochondrial reads in a given data source were exhausted or the filtered contigs between two consecutive rounds were identical. The contigs were rendered circular whenever possible followed by automatic annotations of tRNAs and coding genes using annotated C. elegans mtDNA as a reference. As a test, C. briggsae NGS reads relevant to mtDNA was initially fetched with C. elegans mtDNA as a reference. These steps were used as a training set for pipeline design to optimize the parameters in the pipeline. The source code and the raw data used in this study were deposited in the website: https://github.com/runsheng/mitovar). The pipeline was named as Mitovar (Version 0.99).To benchmark the Mitovar compared with existing softwares for mtDNA assembly, we tested the NGS data of Caenorhabditis species from different sequencing platforms with various read characteristics, including Roche 454, Illumina and ION torrent (Supplementary Table S1). NOVOPlasty and ARC crashed when fed with 454 reads, possibly due to a wide range in read length. Therefore, we only tested these pipelines using C. brenneri reads generated with Illumina platform only. Using NGS data derived from four different Illumina sequencing libraries (Supplementary Table S1) as the read sources and C. briggsae mtDNA sequence as a reference index, we compared the performances between these pipelines by running the programs with default parameters. As a result, Mitovar (V0.99) produced a single contig with a size of 14,212 bp, which was essentially a complete mtDNA; whereas NOVOPlasty (V1.2.3) and ARC (V1.1.3) produced a single contig with a size of 3,870 and 4,959 bp, respectively. Mitobim (V1.9) produced three separated contigs with a size of 1,267, 1,523 and 1,704 bp, respectively. The details of the outs can be found in the link below (https://github.com/Runsheng/mitovar/blob/master/data/benchmark_cbre.fasta), indicating the superiority of the Mitovar over the other pipelines in handling the Caenorhabditis mtDNAs.2.3. Phylogenetic inferenceFor generation of phylogenetic tree, the amino acid sequences of 12 mtDNA-encoded proteins from each species were concatenated with those from P. pacificus as an outgroup, protein sequence alignment and maximum likelihood (ML) tree generation with 1000 bootstraps were performed in ETE3 package,25 using the workflow ‘standard_raxml_bootstrap’ and ‘ptree_raxml_all’.26 The alignment files in ‘fasta’ format and the resulting tree file in ‘newick’ format has been deposited in the website: https://github.com/Runsheng/mitovar/tree/master/data.2.4. Orthology establishment for nucleus-encoded proteins present in mitochondria between human and Caenorhabditis speciesThe C. elegans nucleus-encoded mitochondrial genes were defined by the following steps. Human mitochondrial genes were derived from MitoCarta2.0.27 Their C. elegans orthologs were derived from Wormbase (WS254).28 To identify C. elegans’s orthologs in other Caenorhabditis species, C. elegans mitochondrial genes were used as a query against EggNOG (evolutionary genealogy of genes: Non-supervised Orthologous Groups) database (v4.5), from which ortholog tables for C. briggsae, C. remanei, C. brenneri, C. japonica and P. pacificus were derived.29 The NOGs were further annotated by removing the 12 mtDNA encoded terms, and marking all genes directly related to oxidative phosphorylation complexes. The resulting NOGs were listed in Supplementary Dataset S1. Nuclear genes from other Caenorhabditis species were assembled using Trinity V2.2.30 They were used to fetch corresponding mitochondrial terms in the EggNOG database using ‘hmmsearch’.29 The orthologs for the 14 Caenorhabditis species were listed in Supplementary Dataset S2.2.5. Quantification of mRNA sequencing data for mtDNA-encoded mitochondrial genesFor quantifying the abundance of gene transcripts, mRNA sequencing reads derived from young adults were mapped to respective reference mtDNA sequences using BWA-MEM with default parameters.23 Reads with multiple hits or a lower than 20 of MAPping Quality (MAPQ) value were discarded using Samtools (V1.1). Total number of reads mapped to each gene or NCR were counted using HTseq-count V0.6.31 To generate expression track with RNA-Seq data, count of reads uniquely mapped to mtDNA was normalized against the total number of reads in a given sample. The normalized read counts were used to compute read coverage per nucleotide over the mtDNA. To compare relative expression levels across species using heatmap, Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (RPKM) were calculated for all the samples of each species by averaging the read counts from all samples. To make expression levels comparable across species, the relative expression level was calculated for each gene and NCR by normalization against the average expression level of the 12 protein-coding genes with each species. The resulting expression data matrix was used in the downstream analysis. The matrix was used as an input for average linkage clustering analysis with ‘hclust’ function in R Version 3.1.132 with default parameters.2.6. Quantification of mRNA sequencing data for nucleus-encoded mitochondrial genesProtein sequences encoded by 1,158 human nuclear genes were curated in mitochondria MitoCarta 2.0.27 Their C. elegans orthologs were retrieved from Wormbase (WS254).28 The orthologs of the C. elegans mitochondrial proteins in other nematode species were obtained by querying the individual C. elegans mitochondrial genes in EggNOG database 4.5.29 RPKM for each NOG terms was calculated using ‘Salmon’ V8.1 with default parameters.33 For all the nuclear genes in a single NOG term, transcripts from all isoforms were merged for RPKM calculation. To make the expression levels comparable across species, gene expression levels for each NOG term were normalized in each species by dividing the average RPKM of all genes within each sample to give rise to the relative expression level of each NOG term. The resulting expression values were used in downstream analysis.342.7. Closing the gap in C. sinica D-loop region using nanopore sequencingC. sinica D-loop region was first amplified by nested PCR using the genomic DNA extracted from the strain JU727 as a template. The forward and reverse primer sequences for the first round of PCR were TCGGTCTTCCTCACTTTT and TCTTAGCAACCCAAATGC, respectively. The forward and reverse primer sequences for the second round of PCR were TAAGGGTTATACCTTATTTTTAAG and ATTAAACTATTTACTGAAAACCA, respectively. Because the resulting PCR products still contained multiple bands with subtle difference in size even after multiple attempts through tuning PCR parameter, which is consistent with a previous study that also failed in recovering the full-length of the D-loop,7 it is not possible to resolve the D-loop sequence by Sanger sequencing. Nanopore sequencing technique was used to directly sequence the PCR products. Specifically, the PCR products were size selected by gel purification for multiple bands approximately 490 bp in size, which were used for making sequencing library using 1 D ligation gDNA kit (SQK-LSK108). The library was sequenced on a Nanopore MinION sequencer with R9.4 flow cell (FLO-MIN106) according to manufacturer’s descriptions.Given the complications associated with the D-loop amplification, we reasoned that there could be multiple isoforms of D-loop in the C. sinica mtDNA. After self-correction for read errors and haplotyping using Nanocorr (https://github.com/jgurtowski/nanocorr), we chose the contigs with the highest read coverage for building consensus sequence, which may represent only one of the possible D-loop isoforms plus its neighbouring tRNA gene. The Nanopore sequencing data and the resulting D-loop sequence were deposited in SRA under BioProject PRJNA390876 with accession number of SRR5712476.3. Results3.1. De novo assembly of mitochondrial genome for 14 Caenorhabditis species using MitovarWe first performed de novo genome assembly using Mitovar for four Caenorhabditis species whose complete or partial mtDNAs are available except C. elegans (Fig. 1A and Table 1). The mtDNA sequences we produced were all identical to the existing ones, demonstrating that Mitovar was effective in retrieving and annotating mtDNA. We therefore performed subsequent sequence analysis using the publicly available mtDNAs for the five species and one outgroup species, P. pacificus, except for C. sinica, for which we used the complete mtDNA generated here for subsequent analysis (Table 1). We next performed de novo genome assembly for the remaining 15 Caenorhabditis species whose mtDNAs were not available, although the NGS data of their genomic DNAs were available (Table 1). We successfully generated genome assemblies for 14 of the 15 species using the NGS reads from various sequencing platforms, including Roche 454, Illumina Genome Analyzer II, MiSeq and HiSeq (Supplementary Table S1). Ten out of the 14 mtDNAs were complete as judged by their circular status as well as the presence of all genes expected from C. elegans mtDNA, whereas the remaining four mtDNAs seemed to be incomplete because they could not be rendered circular mainly due to the incompleteness in their D-loop regions (Table 1). The D-loop region commonly carries many simple tandem repeats that are rich in AT, which are problematic for retrieving complete sequence of the D-loop, leading to a partial mtDNA in a linear format (Table 1). This is the case of C. sinica, whose existing mtDNA is incomplete because of its partial D-loop sequence.6 We successfully rendered the mtDNA circular using Nanopore sequencing reads (see Materials and methods). We failed in genome assembly for one species, C. guadeloupensis, previously known as C. sp. 20,35 presumably due to the insufficient reads (coverage lower than 2×) that could be fetched from the deposited dataset. The size selection steps during their preparation of sequencing library probably eliminated most of the mitochondrial reads.Species-specific sampling of ND5 or non-conserved part of D-loop (also called NCR-1) as a novel NCR2.

All six species carry an NCR2 located in a single tRNA gene cluster. The NCR1 and 3 are shared in all Caenorhabditis species.We annotated the mtDNAs for all 14 species using Mitovar. Unlike human mtDNA-encoded genes that are located on both DNA strands, all the 19 Caenorhabditis mtDNAs carry the same number of genes, including 12 genes encoding part of the 4 mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) complexes, 2 rRNA (12S and 16S) and 22 tRNA genes that are located on a single DNA strand with identical synteny (Fig. 1B and C). We defined the start position of the circular mtDNA as the start of the phenylalanine tRNA gene (tRNA-P) located immediately downstream of the D-loop region, which is similar to that used in human.4 To test the use of annotated protein sequences in phylogenetic inference, we built a ML phylogenetic tree of Caenorhabditis species using the concatenated amino acid sequences from the 12 proteins in each species (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Fig. S2) as described.25 The topology of the tree generated here was mostly in agreement with that of a previous phylogenetic tree constructed using the DNA sequences from 11 nuclear genes.14 Slight discrepancy in node branching within the ‘Elegans supergroup’ was likely due to the protein sequences used here but the DNA sequences used previously.3.2. Species-specific sampling of D-loop as a novel NCR in a tRNA cluster of mtDNA in Caenorhabditis speciesThe availability of mtDNAs for 19 Caenorhabditis species allowed us to examine the evolutionary dynamics and origin of the NCRs across species. D-loop is present in all Caenorhabditis species (Figs 1C and 2A). The lengths of the intact D-loop/NCR1 vary substantially among species (Table 1). The most variable regions of the D-loops are located at their 5' regions. The relatively conserved regions of the D-loops are located at their 3' regions, which are rich in AT repeats (Fig. 2A). NCR3 located between ND4 and COX1 is also present in all Caenorhabditis species, which is highly conserved in size (96–112 bp) and in nucleotide sequence (Fig. 2B). In addition to C. briggsae and C. sinica, we detected three other Caenorhabditis species that carried an NCR2 in the same tRNA cluster as that in C. briggsae, including C. afra, C. brenneri and C. tropicalis (Fig. 1C and Table 1). The NCR2s from C. afra, C. sinica and C. briggsae are all located between genes tRNA-Q and tRNA-F, whereas the NCR2s from C. brenneri and C. tropicalis are located between genes tRNA-I and tRNA-R, or between tRNA-Q and tRNA-R, respectively. The sequences of NCR2s are barely alignable between species (Fig. 2C). Apparently, NCR4 is unique to C. briggsae. Sequence conservation of NCRs in Caenorhabditis species. (A) Alignment of NCR1 sequences from the conserved 3' part of NCR1 in 18 Caenorhabditis species whose NCR1 sequence is over 200 bps in length. (B) Alignment of NCR3 full-length sequences from 19 Caenorhabditis species and an NCR from outgroup species P. pacificus. (C) Sequence alignment of NCR2s between five Caenorhabditis species. Note the sequences are barely alignable.Sequence conservation of NCRs in Caenorhabditis species. (A) Alignment of NCR1 sequences from the conserved 3' part of NCR1 in 18 Caenorhabditis species whose NCR1 sequence is over 200 bps in length. (B) Alignment of NCR3 full-length sequences from 19 Caenorhabditis species and an NCR from outgroup species P. pacificus. (C) Sequence alignment of NCR2s between five Caenorhabditis species. Note the sequences are barely alignable.To trace sequence origin of the NCR2s, we performed homology search against both nuclear and mitochondrial sequences. Strikingly, unlike C. briggsae NCR2, which shows the highest sequence homolog to its ND56, the NCR2s in all the other species show the highest sequence homology to their respective D-loop regions (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting their origins from the D-loop. A previous study proposed that C. sinica NCR2 was originated from ND5 based on its modest sequence homology with its incomplete D-loop sequence.7 To confirm this, we performed sequence homology search against NCBI non-redundant DNA sequence database and against the complete D-loop sequence we generated. Although no hit was found in the database, apparent sequence homology between NCR2 and D-loop was observed in C. sinica (Supplementary Fig. S3D) with a much higher similarity score than that between C. sinica NCR2 and ND5. The sequence homology in C. sinica is similar to that in C. afra, C. brenneri and C. tropicalis, suggesting its origin from its D-loop rather than from its ND5. Although C. briggsae is more closely related to C. nigoni than to any other Caenorhabditis species, the two species do not share NCR number and origin, indicating that the NCR2 and NCR4 are generated after divergence from their common ancestor. Notably, like the NCR2s in all Caenorhabditis species which are located in the tRNA cluster between ND2 and cytochrome b (CYTB) genes (Fig. 1B and C), a P. pacificus NCR was also located in a tRNA cluster between COX1 and COX2. Sequence alignment shows that the NCR was also originated from the 5' part of its D-loop (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. S3F). Taken together, our data show that most novel NCRs arise frequently by sampling the D-loop with the exception of C. briggsae NCR2 and NCR4. The results also show that tRNA cluster is a hotspot for introduction of novel NCR. It is not clear why C. briggsae NCR2 adopts an unusual origin compared with the NCR2 origins in other Caenorhabditis species. It is also enigmatic why only a subset of Caenorhabditis species produces a NCR2. In summary, we demonstrated that most of the NCR2s were generated by species-specific sampling of the partial D-loop followed by insertion into a unique tRNA cluster. Whether the NCR2s are strain-specific awaits further investigation. Given the species-specific origin of NCRs, a fascinating question is whether the highly variable NCRs are functional in vivo.3.3. NCR4 is highly expressed, which is associated with up-regulation of ND3 in C. briggsaeTo explore the function of these highly variable NCRs, we quantified the expression of all mtDNA-encoded genes and NCRs using the existing RNA-Seq data, mostly derived from mRNA. To make the expression levels comparable between species, we only used the expression data derived from young adult stage from which we produced the relative expression level within each sample (see Materials and methods). It is intriguing that although most NCRs show no or modest expression relative to coding genes, the NCR2 and NCR4 in C. briggsae are highly expressed (Fig. 3A and B). Given the unique origin of the two genes from ND5 as opposed to the NCR2s in other four species which were originated from a NCR, i.e. D-loop, we asked whether the elevated expression of the two C. briggsae NCRs served to provide an extra dosage of the duplicated ND5 or played a regulatory role for their neighbouring genes. To this end, we performed hierarchical clustering of the relative expression levels of all protein-coding genes encoded by mtDNA using existing RNA-Seq data in the nine nematode strains, including seven nematode species (Supplementary Datasets S1 and S2). Surprisingly, the results showed that C. briggsae ND3 expression level was roughly two orders of magnitude higher than that in the remaining six species (Fig. 3B). The NCR4 is duplicated from the mid-part of ND5 in C. briggsae (Fig. 1B) with at least two independent single-nucleotide deletions, leading to no open reading frame (ORF) that was continuous with its neighbouring genes, i.e. ND3 and ND5 (Supplementary Fig. S4). In addition, the duplicated fragment is flanked by the sequences showing poor alignment with ND5, indicating that it is unlikely that the expression of NCR4 serves to increase the ND5 dosage, consistent with previous observations.6,7,36 Given a significantly elevated expression of ND3 in C. briggsae versus its counterpart in other species and that the NCR4 is located immediately downstream of the gene, we reasoned that the NCR4 might serve as a 3' UTR for ND3 to up-regulate its expression. To examine this possibility, we counted the number of RNA-Seq reads with poly-A tail immediately after the end of ND3 or NCR4. To our surprise, in contrast to other protein-coding neighbouring genes, for example, ND6 and ND4L, whose transcripts are individually polyadenylated, most of the RNA-Seq reads were continuous from ND3 to NCR4, hereafter referred to as continuous read, indicating that the two genes were processed into a single transcript post-transcriptionally. Notably, only 12 of 2,287 (0.52%) continuous reads were polyadenylated immediately at the end of ND3, whereas 120 of the 129 (93.0%) reads mapped to the 3' end of NCR4 were polyadenylated immediately at the end of NCR4 (Fig. 3C), indicating that the elevated expression of ND3 was mainly contributed by the continuous reads spanning both ND3 and NCR4. In addition, the transcript of the NCR4 was predicted to form a stem-loop structure (Supplementary Fig. S5), typical of a bacterial 3' UTR.37 Taken together, we demonstrate that the C. briggsae NCR4 possibly functions as a 3' UTR for ND3 to up-regulate its expression. C. briggsae NCR2 was also highly expressed with a poly-A tail, but only as an independent transcript (Fig. 3A). It remains unclear why the NCR2 shows a relatively higher expression level in C. briggsae than NCR2s in other Caenorhabditis species (Fig. 4).

DiscussionFunction and evolution of mtDNA have long been a hot topic in phylogenetic studies34. Despite the highly conserved coding elements within mtDNAs, its NCRs undergo fast evolution. The function of the highly variable NCRs remains mysterious. Comparative genomics is the method of choice for studying mtDNA evolution and function. With the sharply decreased sequencing costs, sequencing nuclear genome becomes affordable for nearly all species even by an individual research laboratory. Despite the quality of nuclear genome assemblies varies substantially from one another, especially for those that are generated exclusively by NGS data, these sequencing data provide an opportunity to generate a mtDNA with relatively high quality. This is because the mtDNAs usually co-exist with nuclear genome in NGS data. Here we presented mtDNAs from 19 Caenorhabditis species mostly by mining the existing NGS data, 14 of which were reported for the first time. Those mtDNAs form an invaluable resource for further functional and evolutionary studies.38,39,40Discovery of independent duplication of D-loop as a novel NCR in multiple Caenorhabditis species has possible implications in mtDNA replication and transcription. DNA replication in human adopts a model of strand displacement-loop (D-loop) or RNA incorporation throughout the lagging strand (RITOLS)41 starting from the D-loop region, although the exact replication mechanism remains heavily debated.42 Interestingly, mtDNA replication in C. elegans was proposed to adopt a rolling cycle mode, in which the nascent mtDNA formed branched circular lariat structures with concatenated tails that are ultimately resolved into monomeric circles.43 How these polymeric fragments are resolved into a circular one remains an open question. The D-loop serves as both a DNA replication origin and a transcription start site in human.42,44 In addition, mtDNA replication starts with a short RNA transcript as a primer that is also derived from D-loop in human, indicating a coupling between DNA replication and transcription.42 Notably, the D-loop sequences in Caenorhabditis species contain numerous tandem and inverse repeats (Supplementary Fig. S7). Whether the D-loop-derived NCR2s function as an alternative DNA replication origin or a transcription start site awaits further investigation.It is well-established that 3' UTR plays a critical role in stabilizing nuclear mRNA transcript. These UTRs are usually at least tens of bps in length that are bound by RNA-binding proteins. Few mtDNA-encoded genes carry such a long 3' UTR. There are only a short stretch of RNA sequence with handful of bps in length that are present between stop codon and poly-A signal in most mtDNA encoded genes, for example, in human44,45 and rodents.46 It is unclear whether these short sequences work as an effective 3' UTR as that in nuclear genes or not. Our observation that C. briggsae ND3 mRNAs can be alternatively poly-A tailed either immediately after its stop codon or at the end of NCR4 is the first of its kind to our knowledge. This is based on the observation that the majority of ND3 transcripts contain the sequences derived from NCR4, which is associated with its elevated expression in C. briggsae compared with its counterpart in other species (Fig. 3). This raises the possibility the newly duplicated NCR4 could possibly serve as an effective 3' UTR to boost the expression of its host gene. Functional consequences of the increased expression of ND3 remains unclear.Incorporation of NCR2 specifically into a specific tRNA cluster but not into other position suggests that the cluster is a hot spot for novel NCR insertion. We speculate that this cluster may serve as a punctuation site for resolving the branched-circular lariat structure into a circular format during mtDNA replication, but further evidence is needed to test this hypothesis. Availability of mtDNAs in the 19 Caenorhabditis species provides an opportunity for further addressing the evolution, DNA replication and transcription regulation of mtDNA. It will also facilitate investigation into the mechanism of uniparental inheritance of mitochondria as evidenced in both C. elegans47 and C. briggsae.48This work was supported by General Research Fund (HKBU263512, HKBU12103314, HKBU12123716) and Collaborative Research Fund (HKBU5/CRF/11G) from Hong Kong Research Grant Council to Z.Z. and by National Natural Science Foundation of China (31701089) to R.L.

IntroductionGarlic (Allium sativum L.) is a diploid (2n = 2x = 16) species that has been cultivated globally for more than 5,000 yrs as a vegetable, spice, and medicinal plant. The bulb, which is the most widely consumed plant part, consists of several cloves that are abnormal axillary buds. Clove shape traits (CSTs) are economically important quantitative traits. However, garlic has a giant genome1 and the cultivars are generally sterile, both features hindering research on this crop species.Plant quantitative traits are typically controlled by several major and minor effect genes that constitute complex regulatory networks.2 Characterization of quantitative traits is time-consuming and labor-intensive when using traditional quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping methods that involve the identification and cloning of dozens of trait-control genes. Alternatively, a genome-wide association study (GWAS) provides a powerful tool for the identification of genes underlying complex traits.3–6 However, to identify candidate trait genes, a reference genome or linkage map of the species under study is essential for GWAS, which markedly restricts the application of this technology in species with uncharacterized genomes.Unlike genome analysis, transcriptome analysis by next-generation sequencing is rapid, inexpensive, and unconstrained by genomic complexity.7 Recently, transcriptomes have been used in association analysis of traits by associative transcriptomics, which extended the genetic association studies to a broad range of species, especially in complex polyploid species.8,9 However, associative transcriptomics still requires the genome sequence of a progenitor or related species.Here, we propose a novel method termed ‘transcriptome-referenced association study’ (‘TRAS’) that not only identifies trait-associated transcripts in species for which a reference genome sequence is lacking, but also detects potential interactions among these transcripts. In this approach, a transcriptome obtained by single-molecule long-read sequencing is used as a reference sequence for scoring the variation in both sequence (single-nucleotide polymorphisms, SNPs) and expression level (GE) in the population. Both the SNPs and GE are used in an association analysis of a trait to determine candidate transcripts involved in the trait. In addition, SNPs and GE data are used as genotype and phenotype, respectively, in expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis to ascertain the potential interactions among the trait-control transcripts. To assess the feasibility of TRAS, we applied this method to the characterization of three traits of garlic clove shape.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material, experimental design, and phenotypic measurementsWe collected 92 garlic landraces from China and 10 from other countries (Supplementary Table S1). Thus, in total, 102 landraces were planted in the experimental farm (28°11'49""N, 112°58'42""E) of the Institute of Bast Fiber Crops (IBFC), Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences (CAAS), Changsha, China, on 18 September 2014. Field experiments were carried out following a randomized complete block design with two replicates. Thirty-six cloves of garlic for each landrace were planted into a three-row plot, with a distance of 10 cm between the plants and 20 cm between the rows, in each replicate. Thirty plants in the middle of the three rows of each plot were harvested individually in 2015 when their bulbs were ripe. After air drying, the surface of the bulbs, clove length (CL), clove width (CW), and clove thickness (CT) of each bulb were measured using a Vernier caliper.2.2. Tissue sampling and RNA isolationTwelve plants of each landrace were grown in one row for tissue sampling. The experimental farm, sowing date, and planting density were the same as those used for phenotypic measurements. Starting from February 2015, the growth of the bulbs was observed in five plants from each row (from the second to the sixth plant) by carefully removing the soil covering the bulbs; the soil around the roots was not disturbed. When all the observed bulbs in one row began to expand, the bulbs of another five plants (from the seventh to the eleventh plant) were collected and pooled as a sample of the corresponding landrace, immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen, and stored at -80 °C until use. Total RNA of each sample was extracted using an E.Z.N.A. Plant RNA Kit (OMEGA Bio-Tek, Norcross, GA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol.2.3. PacBio SMRTbell library construction and single-molecule sequencingThe landrace from Yangxi (China) was selected among the 102 garlic landraces for single-molecule sequencing. Approximately 1 µg of total RNA of developing bulbs was used for reverse transcription (RT) using a Clontech SMARTer cDNA synthesis kit (Clontech Laboratories, Mountain View, CA, USA) and oligo dT primer to generate full-length cDNA. Three RT reactions were run in parallel, and primer IIA from the kit was used for all PCR reactions following RT. The optimal amplification cycle number for generating dsDNA was determined. PCR products were purified with AMPure PB beads (Pacific Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA, USA). The obtained dsDNA was subjected to size selection using the BluePippin System and subsequent re-amplification. Finally, the products were purified and subjected to Iso-Seq SMRTBell library preparation (https://pacbio.secure.force.com/SamplePrep) to yield three libraries (1–2, 2–3, and 3–6 kb), which were sequenced on the PacBio RSII platform using P6-C4 chemistry.2.4. PacBio sequence data analysisSequence data were processed using the SMRT analysis software (www.pacb.com/products-and-services/analytical-software/devnet/). Circular consensus sequence (CCS) reads were generated from the sub-read files using the following parameters: min_length, 300; max_drop_fraction, 0.8; min_passes, 1; min_predicted_accuracy, 0.8. The generated CCS reads were classified into full-length and non-full-length sequences using the parameters ignorepolyA false and minSeqLength 300. The non-full-length and full-length CCS reads were subjected together to isoform-level clustering under default parameter settings. Sequences that were non-redundant and unextended on either end were defined as transcripts. Because PacBio reads have a higher frequency of nucleotide errors than the shorter reads generated by the second-generation sequencing technologies, the software proovread10 was used to correct those errors based on Illumina RNA-sequencing data of the Yangxi landrace of garlic. Redundant sequences were removed with CD-HIT.112.5. Annotation of the transcriptomeWe detected the protein-coding potential of transcripts using Coding Potential Calculator, which is based on the detection of quality, completeness, and sequence similarity of the open reading frame to proteins in current protein databases, with default parameters.12 Only the transcripts that did not pass the protein-coding-score test were classified as long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), and the others were subjected to functional annotation by searching against seven public databases, including the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant (NR) protein sequences, NCBI nucleotide sequences (NT), eukaryotic ortholog groups (KOG), Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ortholog (KO), Swiss-Prot protein, Gene Ontology (GO), and protein family (PFAM) databases, as described previously.13 The coding sequence (CDS) of each transcript was predicted by BLAST search against the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database (https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and the SwissProt protein database (http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/), as well as by using the ESTscan program.142.6. Illumina RNA-sequencing library construction and sequencingTo characterize the population variation in the SNPs and GE, all 102 landraces were subjected to Illumina RNA sequencing individually. Total RNA from each sample was used to construct cDNA libraries with a fragment length of 250 bp (±25 bp) using a NEBNext® UltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (New England BioLabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Paired-end sequencing was performed for each library using a HiSeq PE Cluster Kit v4 cBot (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) in conjunction with the Illumina sequencing platform (HiSeqTM 2500) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Adapter sequences were trimmed from the raw sequence reads, and the reads were then subjected to a stringent filtering process to yield clean reads; reads with adaptor contamination, reads with more than 20% of Q < 20 bases, and low-quality reads with more than 5% of ambiguous bases (N) were discarded.2.7. Expression analysisTo quantify the expression of each transcript in all 102 landraces, all clean Illumina reads of each landrace were mapped to the reference transcriptome generated by PacBio sequencing by using Bowtie 215 with default parameters. The expression level of each transcript in each sample was analysed by estimating the expected number of fragments per kilobase of transcript sequence per million base pairs sequenced (FPKM) using RSEM.16 A co-expression analysis of the transcripts in the 102 genotypes was conducted using weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA)17 implemented in the R package, and the transcripts that showed co-expression in the population were assigned to a module according to the description of Zhang and Horvath.18 Briefly, co-expression similarity was determined based on the expression levels of all transcripts in the population. According to the similarity value, the co-expressed transcripts were then clustered as a module with the following parameters: the minimum module size was set to 30 transcripts, and modules were merged if they shared at least 25% similarity. Thereafter, the expression value of each transcript in one co-expressed module was used as the eigenvector to estimate the eigenvalue of this module. The eigenvalue of each module was estimated and was used to analyse the modules’ correlation with traits based on Pearson’s correlation coefficients, and to identify the trait-related co-expressed module.2.8. Population SNP detection and phylogenetic analysisTo identify the SNPs from the 102 landraces, all Illumina reads of each sample were aligned to the reference transcriptome using Samtools in Picard.19 After removing the reads without unique location, SNP calling from the population was performed using the GATK software;20 this process required an SNP quality =40. To exclude SNP calling errors caused by incorrect mapping, only high-quality SNPs (coverage depth =2, minor allele frequency =0.05, and missing genotype rate =0.5) were retained. An individual-based neighbour-joining tree was constructed using TreeBest (http://treesoft.sourceforge.net/treebest.shtml) to clarify the phylogenetic relationships of the 102 landraces in the population, and the tree was visualized in Figtree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/).2.9. Identifying candidate transcripts for traitsTo mine the candidate transcripts for CL, CW, and CT, we performed a transcriptome-wide analysis to detect the suggestive loci associated with the traits. In our association panel containing 102 samples, a total of 19,912 high-quality SNPs was used in the association analysis for the three CSTs. We first analysed the population structure, which is helpful for minimizing false positives and increases statistical power. The mixed linear model program GEMMA v.0.94.121 was then used for the association analysis. The first three principal component analysis values (eigenvectors of kinship matrix) derived from all 19,912 SNPs were used as fixed effects in the mixed model to correct for stratification.22 The random effect was estimated from groups clustered based on kinship among all accessions, which was derived from all SNPs. The P-value threshold for suggestive association loci was set to 5 × 10-5; this was calculated by Bonferroni correction based on the effective number of independent markers.6,23 To validate the association between the suggestive loci and the trait, Pearson’s correlation between the expression of the transcript harbouring the suggestive locus and the phenotype of the trait was calculated; significant correlation was assumed at P < 0.05. A transcript associated with a trait at the level of both sequence and expression was defined as a candidate transcript for the trait.2.10. Potential interaction detected by eQTL analysiseQTLs that link the variations in gene expression levels to genotypes have been proven to detect gene interactions.24 To determine the relationship among candidate transcripts, eQTL analysis was performed by TRAS of 102 landraces using a mixed linear model.23 In our eQTL analysis, the 19,912 SNPs were defined as markers, and the expression of candidate transcripts were considered as phenotypes. The P-value threshold was set to 2.5 × 10-6 so as to 5% significance, which was calculated by Bonferroni correction based on the effective number of independent markers. If one transcript was located in the eQTL of another transcript, we assumed that these two transcripts potentially interacted.2.11. Prediction of lncRNA functionThe co-location and co-expression methods have been proposed for predicting lncRNA function.25 However, because a full garlic genome sequence is not available, we used only the latter method to predict lncRNA functions. In brief, the transcripts co-expressed with lncRNA were identified by WGCNA, and GO enrichment analysis was carried out to predict the function of the lncRNA. Adjusted P-values were calculated using the false discovery rate to determine the significance of the enrichment analysis.26 Co-expression networks were constructed with Cytoscape.273. Results3.1. Single-molecule long-read survey of the transcriptome of developing bulbsTo obtain a high-quality reference transcriptome, we sequenced the transcriptome of developing bulbs of a garlic landrace from Yangxi (China) using a single-molecule long-read sequencer from Pacific Biosciences. In total, 8.07 million circular consensus reads representing 10.96 billion bases were generated from three libraries of different fragment sizes, which resulted in a transcriptome that consisted of 36,321 transcripts, accounting for 54.48 million bases in total (Supplementary Table S2). Transcript length ranged from 120 to 4,803 bp, and the average length was 1,500 bp (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S2). To evaluate the completeness of the obtained transcripts, we analysed the ends of the transcript sequences and found that 71.8% of the transcripts had either PolyA sequences in the 3' ends or PolyT sequences in the 5' ends. Because the presence of PolyA or PolyT depends on the orientation of the template, the results indicate that more than 70% of the transcripts were intact at the 3' ends. We also examined the protein-coding potential of these 36,321 transcripts and identified 4,909 (13.5%) lncRNAs (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). Of the remaining coding transcripts, 31,125 transcripts were functionally annotated and the function of only 287 transcripts remained unknown (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3).

A logarithmic scale with a base of three was used in the Y-axis.3.2. Population variation in traits, and in transcript sequences and expressionWe investigated three CSTs in the 102 landraces of garlic collected from China and other countries (Supplementary Table S1), namely CL, CW, and CT (Fig. 2a). The three CSTs varied extensively among the 102 landraces, with 2.3-, 3.7-, and 3.6-fold differences in CL, CW, and CT, respectively (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table S4). We observed a significant correlation among the three traits (corrected P-value < 0.01; Supplementary Table S4), suggesting they were mutually dependent. Characterization of the garlic population.

The 102 landraces were clustered into three distinct groups, and cyan, green, and purple clusters represent groups I, II, and III, respectively.To characterize the genotypes of the 102 landraces in both sequence and expression, we sequenced the transcriptomes of developing bulbs in the population and obtained approximately 6.05 billion clean reads, with an average number of 59.3 million reads for each landrace (Supplementary Tables S1 and S5) The read sequences were aligned with the reference transcriptome generated by single-molecule long-read sequencing; the mapping rate ranged from 51.3% to 80.2% (Supplementary Tables S1 and S5). These mapped reads were further used for scoring the variation in both sequence (SNPs) and GE of transcripts. In total, 55,012 SNPs were identified from 8,245 transcripts, which suggested that the sequences of approximately 77% of the transcripts were conserved in the 102 landraces. After filtering, 19,912 high-quality SNPs were obtained from the 5,408 transcripts, half of which were within the coding sequence region, and the remaining SNPs were located within the 3' and 5' untranslated regions (Fig. 2c). Phylogenetic analysis based on the SNP genotypes resolved the 102 garlic landraces into three distinct groups (Fig. 2d). Interestingly, the landraces from China in the three groups showed a clear geographic distribution (Supplementary Fig. S1). We also quantified GE and characterized the genome-wide expression profile of each landrace in the bulb-expansion stage. Based on WGCNA, 36,321 transcripts were involved in 46 co-expression modules (CEMs) in which the transcript number ranged from 37 to 7,132, and these 46 CEMs were named from M1 to M46 (Supplementary Table S3 and Figs S2 and S3).3.3. Candidate transcripts involved in the determination of CT, CW, and CLWe performed the association analysis by involving the first three principal components in the analysed model as fixed effects, because the first three components explained significantly large variations in the population and we found the presence of three subpopulations in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2d). Finally, we identified 42 SNPs from 27 transcripts, 27 SNPs from 18 transcripts, and 10 SNPs from 8 transcripts that were associated with CL, CW, and CT, respectively (P < 5 × 10-5; Fig. 3a–c and Supplementary Table S6). In total, 36 transcripts were associated with the CSTs. Among them, two were associated with all three CSTs, and 13 were associated with two of the three traits (Fig. 3d).

(f) Venn diagram of the candidate transcripts related to CT, CW, and CL.To ascertain that the candidate transcripts were involved in the CSTs, we performed a correlation analysis of the GE of the 36 transcripts and the corresponding trait phenotype in the population, which revealed that the expression of 14, 11, and 1 transcript was significantly associated with CL, CW, and CT, respectively (P < 0.05; Fig. 3e and Supplementary Table S7). Among those, 6 and 11 transcripts showed a significant negative correlation with CL and CW, respectively, suggesting that the growth of garlic cloves is negatively controlled by these transcripts; whereas 8 and 1 transcript was found to positively regulate CL and CT, respectively. Because both the sequence and GE level were associated with the traits, we concluded that the 14, 11, and 1 transcript identified above were candidate transcripts for CT, CW, and CL, respectively (Table 1). Among them, four were pleiotropic, reducing the total number of candidate transcripts for CSTs to 22.

Characterization of the 22 candidate transcriptsWe analysed the CEM harbouring the candidate transcripts and found that the 22 candidate transcripts were assigned into six CEMs, including nine in M43 and six in M3, respectively (Table 1). Interestingly, five of the six candidate transcripts involved in M3 were found to positively regulate CL, whereas eight of the candidate transcripts involved in M43 negatively controlled the CW trait (Table 1). Correlation analysis of the expression of these two CEMs and the traits revealed that the expression of M3 was significantly positively correlated with the CL trait (r = 0.39, P = 4 × 10-5), and the expression of M43 was negatively correlated with CW (r = –0.4, P = 2 × 10-5) (Supplementary Table S8 and Fig. S4). Since eight transcripts in M43 and five in M3 were candidate transcripts for CW and CL, respectively, and M43 and M3 expression was significantly correlated with CW and CL, respectively, we concluded that M3 and M43 are CEMs that regulate CL and CT, respectively.Among the 22 candidate transcripts, 14 were annotated as protein-encoding RNAs that are involved in carbohydrate metabolism (ASTG1209), transcriptional regulation (ASTG1416), U3 small nucleolar RNA function (ASTG25643), DNA replication and helicase activity (ASTG248, ASTG3501, and ASTG3024), and protein modification (ASTG8464), transport (ASTG4729) and degradation (ASTG3410 and ASTG32719), and four encoded uncharacterized proteins (Table 1). In addition, eight candidate transcripts were predicted to be lncRNAs. The co-expression method was used to predict the potential function of the eight lncRNAs, and the results revealed that a variable number of transcripts, ranging from 4 to 6,301, were co-expressed with the lncRNAs (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S9) and they were enriched for various GO terms, including protein ubiquitin activity involved in protein degradation (Supplementary Table S10). Because the candidate transcripts ASTG3410 and ASTG32719 were annotated to function in protein degradation and the transcripts co-expressed with the lncRNA ASTG1548 were enriched for GO terms associated with protein degradation, we deduced that protein degradation potentially has a role in the regulation of CSTs.

Potential interactions among clove shape-associated candidate transcriptsThe eQTL analysis is an efficient tool for identifying genetic variants that affect the gene expression, and thus, it has been frequently applied in detecting the interactions and determining the regulation relationship between genes.24,28 Herein, to detect potential interactions among the trait-associated transcripts, we carried out eQTL analysis for the 22 trait-associated transcripts. The results showed that a variable number of SNPs were associated with the expression of the 22 transcripts (Supplementary Table S11 and Figs S5–S26). No SNPs associated with the expression of ASTG42793 were identified, suggesting that the expression of this transcript is rarely regulated by other transcripts and that they possibly function upstream from the pathway involved in trait regulation. The expression of ASTG628, ASTG1416, and ASTG25643 was associated with at least 30 SNPs (in 39, 38, and 149 transcripts, respectively), indicating that these three candidate transcripts are modulated by the expression of many transcripts and that they probably function downstream of the pathway for trait regulation.Thereafter, the transcript in which expression-associated SNPs (eQTLs) were located was analysed. We assumed that if a transcript and its eQTL-located transcript were associated with the same trait in sequence, then the two transcripts interacted to control the trait. We next identified the eQTL-located transcript for each candidate trait-associated transcript. The correlation between the expression level of the transcript and that of the corresponding eQTL-located-transcript was used to confirm their interaction. Among the 22 candidate transcripts, 13 had potential interactions. Of the 14 CL candidate transcripts, five showed potential interaction (Supplementary Table S12) and constituted two regulatory pathways: one, in which ASTG32719 influences the expression of ASTG25643, and another, in which ASTG3410 controls the expression of ASTG299, thereby modulating the expression of ASTG1209 (Fig. 5). In addition, 10 of the 11 CW candidate transcripts were found to form a potential interaction network (Fig. 5) in which ASTG35908 was a key transcript that determined CW, not only through the regulation of ASTG1209, but also by integrating a set of at least eight transcripts in a complex pathway (Fig. 5). Among these eight transcripts, ASTG35908 regulates the expression of ASTG1416, which then regulates ASTG3501; this in turn controls the expression of ASTG35427 and ASTG180, whose feedback affects the expression of ASTG3501 in the regulatory loop ASTG3501-ASTG35427-ASTG180. ASTG35427 and ASTG180 also modulate the expression of ASTG1416 to precisely control the expression of ASTG3501. Finally, stable expression of the ASTG3501-ASTG35427-ASTG180 regulatory loop controls the expression of ASTG35109 to determine CW (Fig. 5). Thus, ASTG1209 and ASTG35109 are two key transcripts in the pathway downstream of the regulatory network of CL and CW that function simultaneously. These results provide insight into the interaction network that controls CSTs of garlic.

DiscussionThe present study developed a TRAS approach based on association mapping and eQTL analysis that is independent of a reference genome of the studied species, and thus, theoretically can be applied to nearly all species. TRAS offers three additional advantages in comparison with the GWAS approach. First, TRAS can directly detect candidate transcripts for a trait by integrating sequence data with expression data. In contrast, GWAS identifies only a genome region in which markers are in linkage disequilibrium for the loci controlling the trait. Unlike GWAS, after identifying a genome region based on the sequence variation, TRAS uses the information on transcript expression in the identified region to determine whether or not the corresponding transcript is associated with a given trait. Second, TRAS can detect potential interaction of transcripts by eQTL analysis. Although it remains questionable whether the interaction identified by TRAS is due to direct or indirect regulation, the potential relationship among the transcripts is helpful for further validation of these interactions.One main shortcoming of TRAS is that it cannot identify SNPs in non-expressed genes or regulatory regions of genes. However, this disadvantage can be addressed by experimental design. For example, depending on target traits, selection of a tissue at a proper growth stage of the organ can ensure that most of the genes involved in trait regulation of this organ are included in the TRAS analysis. In addition, if sequence variation in a regulatory region causes changes in the expression of the corresponding gene, this gene, whether or not involved in the trait, can be determined by association between expression of this gene and the trait.To test the feasibility of the TRAS approach, a reference transcriptome of garlic was generated and used to characterize three CSTs in this study. Several previous studies conducted de novo assembly of the garlic transcriptome, producing more than 120,000 transcripts with an average length of less than 600 bp, of which only 35–42% were functionally annotated.13,29,30 These data indicated that a large number of transcripts in these transcriptomes were incomplete and could not qualify for the reference sequence in TRAS. Therefore, this study used the single-molecule long-read sequencing technology for RNA sequencing, which significantly improved the transcriptome quality—the mean length of the transcripts was 1,500 bp; more than 70% of the transcripts had a complete 3' end; and only less than 1% of the transcripts remained functionally unannotated. Based on this transcriptome, substantial amounts of SNPs were identified in the population. When association analysis for the CSTs was performed, principal component analysis was used to decrease the rate of potential false-positive association caused by population stratification. Finally, 42, 27, and 10 SNPs (involved in 36 transcripts in total) were found to be significantly associated with CL, CW, and CT, respectively, and their observed P-values were lower than the expected values, suggesting that the associations between these genomic regions where 36 transcripts were located and the CSTs are reliable. Irrespective of the association in terms of sequence variation, the gene expression levels of 22 of the 36 transcripts showed significant correlation with the CSTs, suggesting that the association of these 22 transcripts were authentic, and these 22 transcripts were candidate transcripts involved in regulating CSTs. However, the remaining 14 transcripts were associated with the CSTs only in terms of the sequences, but not in terms of expression, which was probably caused by the following: association study based on sequence variation identifies a genome region in which the markers are in linkage disequilibrium for the gene involved in regulating the trait; this linkage disequilibrium region probably harbours several genes, and only one of them is the gene that regulates the trait; thus, if the associated markers-located gene is not the trait-conferring candidate, then the expression of this gene would not be correlated with the trait. In summary, there were 22 candidate transcripts identified to be involved in regulating the CSTs, suggesting that TRAS is suitable for genetic dissection of complex traits in species lacking reference genomes.Garlic cloves are abnormal, expanding axillary buds that are rarely found among vascular plants. The genetic mechanism of their development is poorly understood. This study identified 22 candidate transcripts involved in regulating the CSTs, eight of which (36.4%) were lncRNAs. This ratio was far higher than that in the transcriptome (13.5%), indicating that non-coding RNAs play important roles in the determination of clove morphology. Interestingly, we found that the lncRNA ASTG1548 and two candidate transcripts—ASTG3410 and ASTG32719—were potentially involved in protein degradation. Protein degradation possibly plays important roles in the regulation of the CSTs. Analogously in rice, at least three genes that function in protein degradation (GW2, qSW5/GW5, HGW) are involved in regulating grain shape.31–34 Because both rice grain and garlic clove obtain a tridimensional appearance during their development, it is possible that the pathway of protein degradation plays a similarly important role in the development of rice grain and garlic clove.It is notable that carbohydrates are the main component of garlic bulbs.35 We identified a transcript—ASTG1209—encoding alpha-1, 4 glucan phosphorylase that is associated with both CW and CL, suggesting that carbohydrate metabolism contributes to clove development. One candidate transcript, ASTG1416, encodes a sequence-specific DNA-binding protein with transcriptional regulatory activity. The bulb of garlic undergoes expansion, which requires cell proliferation that necessitates DNA replication. In the present study, three CST-related transcripts were found to be involved in DNA replication. In addition, one transcript associated with protein modification, one encoding a protein transporter, and two related to protein degradation were linked to the regulation of the CSTs, suggesting that post-translational modification plays a role in the control of the CSTs. However, some candidate protein-coding transcripts were uncharacterized; clarifying their role in the regulation of the CSTs can provide new insights into the genetic basis of garlic bulb formation. In conclusion, 22 CST-related candidate transcripts were identified in garlic, a species without a reference genome, and their potential interactions were ascertained. Our results demonstrate that TRAS is a useful approach for association studies, and its independence from a reference genome will extend the applicability of association studies to a broad range of species. Additionally, the CST-related candidate transcripts identified herein can provide a basis for improving the CSTs in garlic breeding.5.

IntroductionBlue Anise Sage (Salvia guaranitica L.), belongs to the genus Salvia, which is one of the economically best-known genera due to its vast medicinal properties and rich aromatic oils. The genus Salvia (tribe Mentheae) is the largest of the Lamiaceae family, which comprises nearly 1,000 species. Salvia plants are widely distributed in three regions around the world but mainly exist in Central and South America (~500 species), West Asia (~200 species) and East Asia (~100 species), while the other Salvia species are spread throughout the world.1 Most of these plants contain various medicinally active components used throughout history in folk medicine, e.g. S. officinalis, S. japonica, S. santolinifolia, S. hydrangea, S. tomentosa, S. tuxtlensis, S. miltiorrhiza, S. chloroleuca, S. nipponica, S. fruticosa, S. aureus, S. przewalskii, S. epidermindis, S. isensis, S. lavandulifolia, S. glabrescens, S. allagospadonopsis, S. macrochlamys and S. recognita. Recently, Salvia species have become a valuable source for pharmaceutical research for identifying and discovering biologically active compounds.2 Essential oils of Salvia species exhibit significant bioactivities, including antimicrobial, antimutagenic, anticancer, antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, choleretic and antimicrobial activities. Salvia essential oils contain more than 100 active compounds with pharmacological effects, and they can be categorized into monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, diterpenes and triterpenes.2 During their biosynthesis, these terpenoids are sequentially built up from the isoprene units (C5) building block, isopentyl diphosphate (IPP) and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP). These components are condensed in a sequential manner by prenyltransferases, resulting in the formation of prenyl diphosphates, such as geranyl diphosphate (GPP), farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP).3 These prenyl diphosphates are the immediate precursors for the biosynthesis of mono-, sesqui-, di- and tetraterpenes. Despite the scientific and medicinal interests in these terpenoids of S. guaranitica, the genes that are related to the biosynthesis of these compounds have not yet been fully identified or understood. Plant secondary metabolites have significant use in the food and pharmaceutical industries, such as in fine chemicals, and cosmetics. The biosynthesis, regulation and metabolic engineering of useful secondary metabolites have been extensively studied.4 In recent years, next-generation sequencing (NGS)-based RNA sequencing (RNA-Seq) has become a powerful tool for discovering genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of various secondary metabolite pathways in medicinal plants.5 For example, the volatile terpenoid biosynthesis in Salvia officinalis,6 the phenylpropanoid and terpenoid biosynthesis pathways in Ocimum sanctum and Ocimum basilicum,7 the biosynthesis of active ingredients in Salvia miltiorrhiza,8 the essential oil biosynthesis in aromatic Cymbopogon flexuosus,9 the biosynthesis of carotenoids in Momordica cochinchinensis,10 the biosynthesis of cellulose and lignin in Cunninghamia lanceolata11 and the biosynthesis of tea-specific compounds, i.e. catechins, caffeine and theanine pathways in Camellia sinens,12 have been explored by using NGS. Characterization of plant terpene synthases is typically carried out by the production of the recombinant enzymes in Escherichia coli. This is often difficult due to enzyme solubility and codon usage issues. Furthermore, plant terpene synthases that are localized to the plastids, such as diterpene synthases, must be abridged in a more or less experimental approach to ameliorate expression.13,14 Transgenic Arabidopsis (A. thaliana) is very efficient and has been successfully used for the characterization of one sesquiterpene synthase (PmSTS) genes from Polygonum minus: ß-sesquiphellandrene, and also has been successfully used for the characterization the strawberry linalool/nerolidol synthase (monoterpene) and taxadiene synthase.15,16 Here, we characterized genes that are involved in terpenoid biosynthesis in S. guaranitica and determined their biological significance in S. guaranitica for terpenoid production in various tissues. In this study, a transcriptome database was established for S. guaranitica leaves using NGS technology to identify and to characterize genes that are related to the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway. The criteria used to achieve these objectives and to elucidate the complex metabolic pathways and genes for the understanding of terpenoid production in S. guaranitica included the following: (i) transcriptome analysis of leaves using Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencing; (ii) GC-MS analysis for six fresh plant parts (old leaves, young leaves, stems, flowers, bud flowers and roots); (iii) characterization of three terpene genes in transgenic A. thaliana; (iv) qRT-PCR of highly expressed genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of terpenoids; (v) and the combination of data from the transcriptome, qRT-PCR and metabolome with GC-MS for revealing the functions of metabolic genes that are involved in the biosynthesis of valuable terpenoids.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and tissue collectionSeedlings of Salvia guaranitica L. were collected from the Wuhan Botanical Garden, China, and grown at National Key Laboratory of Crop Genetic Improvement farm of Huazhong Agricultural University, Wuhan, China. Different tissues were sampled from one-year-old S. guaranitica plants. For RNA-Seq, three biological replicates from leaves were sampled and handled. Each replicate consisted of two young and two old leaves from the same plant. For qRT-PCR, three biological replicates were collected from the following six parts (old leaves, young leaves, stems, flowers, bud flowers and roots). All samples were directly frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -80 °C until RNA extraction. Furthermore, another three biological replicates from the individual six fresh parts were collected for isolation of the essential oil.2.2. Isolation of chemical compoundsThe correct method to reduce technical variability throughout a sampling procedure is essential to stop cell metabolism and to avoid leaking of metabolites during the various preparation steps before the actual metabolite extraction. Therefore, three biological replicates from each of the six fresh parts were immediately frozen on dry ice. In the laboratory, the frozen three biological replicates from each of the three fresh part samples were homogenized with a mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen, after which the plant material (ca. 10 g) was directly soaked in n-hexane as a solvent in Amber storage bottles, 60 ml screw-top vials with silicone/PTFE septum lids (http://www.sigmaaldrich.com) were used to reduce loss of volatiles to the headspace then incubated with shaking at 37 °C and 200 rpm for 72 h. Afterward, the solvent was transferred using a glass pipette to a 10-ml glass centrifuge tube with screw-top vials with silicone/PTFE septum lids and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove plant debris. The supernatant was pipetted into glass vials with a screw cap, and oil was concentrated until remaining 1.5 ml of concentrated oils under a stream of nitrogen gas in a nitrogen evaporator (Organomation) with a water bath at room temperature (Toption-China-WD-12). The concentrated oils transferred to a fresh crimp vial amber glass, 1.5 ml screw-top vials with silicone/PTFE septum lids were used to reduce a loss of volatiles to the headspace. For absolute oil recovery, the remaining film crude oil in the internal surface of concentrated glass vials was dissolved in the minimum volume of n-hexane, thoroughly mixed and transferred to the same fresh crimp vial amber glass, 1.5 ml. And the crimp vial was placed on the auto-sampler of the gas chromatography-mass spectrometer (GC-MS) system for GC-MS analysis, or each tube was covered with parafilm after closed with screw-top vials with silicone/PTFE septum lids and stored at -20 °C until GC-MS analysis.62.3. GC-MS analysis of essential oil componentsGC analysis was performed using a Shimadzu model GCMS-QP2010 Ultra (Tokyo, Japan) system. An approximately 1 µl aliquot of each sample was injected (split ratios of 15: 1) into a GC-MS equipped with an HP-5 fused silica capillary column (30 m × 0.25 mm ID, 0.25 µm film thicknesses). And we used Helium as a carrier gas at a constant flow of 1.0 ml min-1. The mass spectra were monitored between 50 and 450 m/z. Temperature was initially under isothermal conditions at 60 °C for 10 min. Temperature was then increased at a rate of 4 °C min-1 to 220 °C, held isothermal at 220 °C for 10 min, increased by 1 °C min-1 to 240 °C, held isothermal at 240 °C for 2 min and finally held isothermal for 10 min at 350 °C. The identification of the volatile constituents were determined by parallel comparison of their recorded mass spectra with the data stored in the Wiley GC/MS Library (10th edition) (Wiley, New York, NY, USA), the volatile organic compounds (VOC) analysis S/W software and the NIST Library (2014 edition). The relative % amount of each component was calculated by comparing its average peak area to the total areas, as well as retention time index. All of the experiments were performed simultaneously three times under the same conditions for each isolation technique with total GC running time was 80 min.62.4. RNA extractionTotal RNAs from the three biological leaf replicates were extracted for RNA-Seq. Moreover, total RNAs from three biological replicates from each of the plant parts (old leaves, young leaves, stems, flowers, bud flowers and roots) were extracted for qRT-PCR. Additionally, total RNAs from three biological replicates of A. thaliana were extracted for semiquantitative RT-PCR using the TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen, USA) and treated with DNase I (Takara). RNA quality was examined on 1% agarose gels, and the purity was analysed using a Nano-Photometer® spectrophotometer (IMPLEN, CA, USA). RNA concentration was determined using a Qubit® RNA Assay Kit in a Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies, CA, USA). RNA pools were prepared for cDNA libraries by mixing equal volumes from the three RNAs replications in one tube.2.5. cDNA library preparation and sequencingThree micrograms of RNA per sample were used for generating a sequencing library. cDNA was synthesized using an RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB, USA) for generated sequencing libraries according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The first strand of cDNA was synthesized in the presence of random hexamer primers and M-MuLV Reverse Transcriptase (RNase H), and the second strand of cDNA was synthesized in the presence of DNA Polymerase I and RNase H. The remaining cDNA was converted into blunt ends in the presence of exonuclease/polymerase activities. After the adenylation of three ends of DNA fragments, NEB Next, an adaptor with a hairpin loop structure, was ligated to prepare for hybridization. To select cDNA fragments of preferentially 150~200 bp in length, the library fragments were purified using an AMPure XP system (Beckman Coulter, Beverly, USA). Then, 3 µl of USER Enzyme (NEB, USA) was used with size-selected, adaptor-ligated cDNA at 37 °C for 15 min followed by 95 °C for 5 min. Afterward, PCR was performed with Phusion High-Fidelity DNA polymerase, universal PCR primers and Index (X) Primer. Finally, PCR products were purified (AMPure XP system), and the library quality was assessed using an Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). Clustering of the index-coded samples was performed on a cBot Cluster Generation System using a TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS (Illumina) according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Novogene Experimental Department). After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform, and paired-end (PE) reads were generated.2.6. Quality controlRaw data (raw reads) in the fastq format were first processed through in-house Perl scripts. During this step, clean data (clean reads) were obtained by removing reads containing adapters, reads containing ploy-N and low-quality reads from the raw data. At the same time, Q20, Q30, GC content and sequence duplication level of the clean data were calculated. All of the downstream analyses were based on high-quality clean data.2.7. De novo transcriptome assemblyDe novo assembly of the processed reads was carried out using Trinity program (Version: trinityaseq_r 2012-10-05)17,18 with the min_kmer_cov set to 2 by default and all other parameters set to default. The Trinity method consists of three software modules, (1) Inchworm, (2) Chrysalis and (3) Butterfly, applied sequentially to process large volumes of RNA-Seq reads. In the first step, read datasets were assembled into linear contigs by the first module (Inchworm program). The minimally overlapping contigs were then clustered into sets of connected components (build graph components) by the second module (Chrysalis program), and the transcripts were then constructed from each de Bruijn graph by the third software module (Butterfly program). Finally, the transcripts were clustered by a similarity of correct match length beyond 80% for longer transcripts or 90% for shorter transcripts using the multiple sequence alignment tool. The transcriptome data from S. guaranitica was submitted to the NCBI under submission ID (1955911). And the accession number from BankIt1954130 (KX869088) to BankIt1954278 (KX869125), and from BankIt1955703 (KX893913) to BankIt1955935 (KX894017) see Tables 1 and 2.

Additionally, the unigenes were used as query sequences for searching the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genome (KEGG) pathways database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/) and the Pfam (Protein family) database (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/).2.9. Differential expression analysisExpression levels of unigenes were normalized and calculated as the values of fragments per kilobase of transcripts per million mapped fragments (FPKM) during the assembly and clustering process. Differential expression analysis of unigenes was performed using the DESeq R package (1.10.1). DESeq provides statistical routines for assessing the differential genes expression in leaf tissues and assigns genes as differential expressed when the P-value < 0.05. P-value results were corrected using the Benjamini and Hochberg approach for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR).192.10. Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysisQuantitative real-time PCR was performed using an IQTM5 Multicolor Real-Time PCR Detection System (Bio-Rad, USA) as described previously60 with SYBR Green Master (ROX) (Newbio Industry, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions at a total reaction volume of 20 µl. Gene-specific primers for SgActin as a reference gene and for the other 15 gene (SgGPPS, SgFPPS, SgHUMS, SgNEOD-1, SgNEOD-2, SgNEOD-3, SgTPS-1, SgTPS-3, SgTPS-6, SgLINS-1, SgLINS -2, SgGLNS, SgGERIS, SgTPS-V and SgFARD) involved in the biosynthesis of terpenes were designed using the primer designing tools of IDTdna (http://www.idtdna.com), as listed in Supplementary Table S1. The quantitative RT-PCR conditions were set as standard conditions: 95 °C for 3 min, 40 cycles of amplification (95 °C for 10 s, 60 or 58 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 20 s), and a final extension at 65 °C for 1 min. The values are means ± SE of three replicates was normalized using SgActin as a reference gene. The relative expression levels were calculated by comparing the cycle thresholds (CTs) of the target genes with that of the reference gene SgActin using the 2-<U+0394><U+0394>Ct method.6,20,21 The sizes of amplification products were 140–160 bp. The quantified data were analysed using the Bio-Rad IQTM 5 Multicolor Real-Time Manager software. Finally, the relative expression levels of SgGPPS, SgFPPS, SgHUMS, SgNEOD-1, SgNEOD-2, SgNEOD-3, SgTPS-1, SgTPS-3, SgTPS-6, SgLINS-1, SgLINS-2, SgGLNS, SgGERIS, SgTPS-V and SgFARD were detected.2.11. Identification of simple sequence repeats (SSRs)All of the transcripts of S. guaranitica were analysed with the MISA program version 1.0 (http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa/misa.html) for the detection of simple sequence repeat (SSR) motifs that have mono- to hexanucleotide repeats. In addition, primers for each SSR were designed using Primer3 version 2.3.5 (http://primer3.sourceforge.net/releases.php). The minimum number of SSR repeat units during analysis was =24 for mono- and dinucleotides and was 8, 7, 7 and 9 for tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide repeats, respectively. The default parameters corresponding to each unit size of the minimum number of repetitions were 1-10, 2-6, 3, 5, 4, 5, 5, 5 and 6-5 for Unigene SSR detection.2.12. Full-length terpene synthase cDNA clones and vectorsFull-length cDNAs for SgFPPS, SgGPPS and SgLINS were obtained by PCR amplification using short and long gene-specific primers (Supplementary Table S2, Fig. S1) based on RNA-Seq sequence information from the transcriptome sequencing of S. guaranitica leaves. Leaf cDNA was used as a template for the initial PCR amplification and performed using short primers with the KOD-Plus DNA polymerase (Novagen) under the following PCR conditions: 3 min at 94 °C followed by 10 s at 98 °C; 30 s at 60, 60 and 59 °C (different annealing temperatures), 1.30 min at 68 °C, and then 10 min at 68 °C. This process was repeated for 35 cycles. The first PCR products was used as a template for PCR cloning using long primers with the KOD-Plus DNA polymerase for the Gateway pDONR221 vector. The amplified PCR products were purified and cloned into the Gateway entry vector pDONR221 using BP Clonase (Invitrogen, USA). The resulting pDONR221 constructs harbouring target genes were sequenced, and Gateway LR Clonase (Invitrogen, USA) was used for recombination into the destination vector pB2GW7 for A. thaliana transformation. All final constructs containing SgFPPS, SgGPPS and SgLINS were confirmed by sequencing.2.13. Arabidopsis plant growth conditions and preparation of Agrobacterium cultures for floral-dip transformationEcotype of A. thaliana plant seeds Columbia-0 (Col-0) were pre-germinated by adding 1 ml sterilized water on some seed at 1.5 ml Eppendorf tube, then incubated at 4 °C for three days at the refrigerator. After that A. thaliana seeds had been growing in our Key Lab growth chamber at a temperature of 22 °C day/20 °C night with humidity of 50–70%, and photoperiod at 16 h day/8 h night, with a light density of 100–150 µmoles m -2 s -1 using fluorescent bulbs. After 2 months plants were ready for floral-dip transformation, and one week after the primary inflorescences were clipped. Plant watering was stopped 3 days prior to transformation for improved and increase the transformation efficiency. In addition, the constructs of pB2GW7 vectors with all inserted genes were introduced into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 by direct electroporation. Recombinant A. tumefaciens was grown for 2 days at 28 °C in solid LB media supplemented with 50 µg/ml each of rifampicin and spectinomycin. An individual colony of each sample was inoculated into 1.0 ml of liquid medium and grown at 28 °C under 200 rpm agitation overnight with the same media composition. After 24 h, 1.0 ml of each sample of liquid medium was transferred to a 250-ml conical flask containing 50 ml of LB media supplemented with the same compositions; the samples were grown at 28 °C in a shaker overnight until an optical density of 0.6–8.0 (OD 600) was reached. Overnight cell cultures were harvested by centrifugation at 5,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C, and the pellet was resuspended in the floral-dip inoculation medium contained 5% sucrose and 0.05% Silwet. A. thaliana was transformed by soaked the secondary inflorescences in the inoculation medium and stirred gently to allow the intake of Agrobacterium harbouring the pB2GW7 vector into the flower gynoecium. The transformed plants were kept in the dark and wrapped with plastic cover overnight to maintain humidity. The next day, the plants were returned back to their normal growth conditions. The transformation was repeated after 1 week to increase the transformation efficiency. Plants were grown for additional 4–5 weeks until all of the siliques became brown and dry. The seeds were harvested and stored at 4 °C under desiccation.15,16 BASTA was used for selection of transformant seedlings which were also confirmed with PCR for positive transgenic lines, more than 10 positive plant lines from each gene were analysed for terpenoid profiling and target gene expression.2.14. Semiquantitative RT-PCR analysisSemiquantitative real-time PCR was performed on an Eppendorf PCR (Eppendorf Mastercycler-Nexus GSX1, POCD Scientific, Australia) system with a total reaction volume of 25 µl. A gene-specific primer for AT-B-actin was used as a reference gene, and the other three gene-specific primers for SgFPPS, SgGPPS and SoLINS which are involved in the biosynthesis of terpenes, were designed using the primer designing tools of IDTdna (http://www.idtdna.com/scitools/ Applications/RealTimePCR/); the primer sequences are listed in (Supplementary Table S1). The semiquantitative RT-PCR conditions were as follows: predenaturation step at 95 °C for 4 min, 35 cycles of amplification (95 °C for 30 s, 60or 59 °C for 30 s and 72 °C for 1 min), and a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were resolved on 1% agarose gel, and the expression levels of AT-BActin, SgFPPS, SgGPPS and SgLINS genes were detected.2.15. Metabolite extraction from transgenic A. thaliana leavesTerpenoid compounds from non-transgenic A. thaliana leaves (control) and transgenic A. thaliana leaves containing either SgFPPS, SgGPPS and SgLINS expression constructs were extracted and isolated. For this, 15 leaves from each transgenic A. thaliana line (three leaf from each plant) were homogenized in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle, after which the plant material powder was directly soaked in n-hexane as a solvent in Amber storage bottles, 30 ml screw-top vials with silicone/PTFE septum lids (http://www.sigmaaldrich.com) were used to reduce loss of volatiles to the headspace then incubated with shaking at 37 °C and 200 rpm for 72 h. Afterward, the solvent was transferred using a glass pipette to a 10-ml glass centrifuge tube with screw-top vials with silicone/PTFE septum lids and centrifuged at 5,000 rpm for 10 min at 4 °C to remove plant debris. The supernatant was pipetted into glass vials with a screw cap and oil was concentrated until remaining 1.5 ml of concentrated oils under a stream of nitrogen gas with a nitrogen evaporator (Organomation) and water bath at room temperature (Toption-China-WD-12). The concentrated oils transferred to a fresh crimp vial amber glass, 1.5 ml screw-top vials with silicone/PTFE septum lids were used to reduce a loss of volatiles to the headspace. For absolute oil recovery, the remaining film crude oil in the internal surface of concentrated glass vials was dissolved in the minimum volume of n-hexane, thoroughly mixed and transferred to the same fresh crimp vial amber glass, 1.5 ml. And the crimp vial was placed on the auto-sampler of the GC-MS system for GC-MS analysis, or each tube was covered with parafilm after closed with screw-top vials with silicone/PTFE septum lids and stored at -20 °C until GC-MS analysis. The same programme and standard conditions that were used for GC-MS analysis with S. officinalis essential oil components were applied.63. Results and discussion3.1. Identification of essential oil componentsFor GC-MS analysis, 204 compounds were identified using n-hexane extracts from six fresh parts of S. guaranitica. The numbers of obtained compounds from old leaves, young leaves, stems, flowers, bud flowers and roots were 71 (98.73%), 29 (74.58%), 21 (83.87%), 45 (93.51%), 32 (80.06%) and 45 (96.79%), respectively. The results of the qualitative and quantitative analyses of all compounds from the essential oils are reported in (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S3). The identified compounds are listed based on the retention time, compounds mass and percentage of peak area (Fig. 1A and B). In old leaves, one triterpene was shown as the main compound (32.31%), followed by the group of diterpene (21.16%) and sesquiterpenes group (16.7%). In young leaves, the sesquiterpenes compounds were observed to be the main group (25.78%), followed by one diterpene and one monoterpene compounds represented (11.45 and 0.19%), respectively. The main compound in the stem was one triterpene (0.15%). Furthermore, in flowers the sesquiterpenes compounds were observed to be the main group (0.42%), followed by one diterpene compound (0.01%).

(A) GC-MS Peak of the essential oil, (B) mass spectrum of GC peak with retention time for the major compound, (C) Six-way Venn diagram to show the number of unique and common compounds in the essential oil extracts from old leaf (A), young leaf (B), stem (C), flower (D), bud flower (E) and root (F) of S. guaranitica.On the other hand, in bud flowers, the monoterpenes compounds were shown as the main group (1.11%), followed by one diterpene and one sesquiterpene compound represented (0.48 and 0.03%), respectively. Finally, Monoterpenes from the main group of compounds (7.81%) found in the roots, followed by sesquiterpene group represented 4.0%. Moreover, the six hexane extracts from the different tissue essential oils have unique, common and major compounds. For example, the extracts of old leaf essential oils (A) had 57 unique compounds, three common compounds shared with extracts from young leaf essential oils, one common compound shared with extracts from stem essential oils, three common compounds shared with extracts from flower essential oils and two common compounds shared with extracts from bud flower essential oils. Furthermore, the young leaf essential oils (B) contained 19 unique compounds. While the stem essential oils (C) contained 11 unique compounds and two common compounds shared with extracts from flower essential oils and three common compounds shared with extracts from root essential oils. Also, the extracts from flower essential oils (D) had 30 unique compounds, four common compounds shared with extracts from bud flower essential oils. Moreover, the extracts from bud flower essential oils (E) and the root essential oils (F) had 24 and 37 unique compounds, respectively (Fig. 1C). On the other hand, we found one common compound named (Cyclooctasiloxane, hexadecamethyl) shared with all six plant parts. Additionally, we found some other common compounds shared among all six plant parts, such as (trans-phytol, 2-methyloctacosane, ß-caryophyllene, cyclohexasiloxane, dodecanethiol-, cycloheptasiloxane, tetradecane- methyl- and cyclononasiloxane, octa deca methyl-) (Supplementary Table S3 and Fig. 1C). Regarding the major compounds, squalene (32.31%) was the major compound in the essential oils extracts of old leaves, followed by trans-phytol (21.11%), (-)-germacrene D (5.43%), n-octadecanal (5.15%), 8-isopropenyl-1, 5-dimethyl-1, 5-cyclodecadiene (4.88%) and ß-caryophyllene (1.33%), whereas the essential oil of young leaves was also characterized by trans-phytol (11.45%), followed by (-)-germacrene D (10.7%), 8-isopropenyl-1, 5-dimethyl-1, 5-cyclodecadiene (8.8%), caryophyllene oxide (4.16%), 3-methyl-cis-3a, 4, 7, 7a-tetrahydroindan (3.49%) and ß-caryophyllene (1.98%). N-octadecanal was characterized as the major compound in stem extracts (38.78%), followed by undecane, 2-methyl (1.27%), and then squalene (0.15%). Furthermore, the essential oils of flowers was also characterized by 2-methyloctacosane (5.34%), followed by 10-methyleicosane (1.9%), and tetracosane, 2-methyl (1.7%). Moreover, the essential oil of bud flowers was also characterized by peppermint camphor (0.83%) as a major compound, followed by trans-phytol (0.48%), angelicoidenol (0.28%) and longi borneol (0.03%). Finally, the root essential oil was characterized by 1,8-cineol (2.61) as a major compound, followed by caryophyllene oxide (1.91), ledol (1.56), (-)-camphor (1.14), laevo-ß-pinene (0.97) and a-pinene (0.96) (Table 3). When comparing the composition of the six essential oil extracts of S. guaranitica, we deduced that some common compounds exist at different levels within the parts of S. guaranitica (Fig. 1A). Additionally, some of the compounds that have been found in S. guaranitica were detected in the other Salvia plant species (Table 3 and Supplementary Table S3).6,13,14,22 Therefore, we suggest that plant parts can have a major effect on the metabolic composition of their essential oils.23,24 From the previous GC-MS data, an important question has been raised, why do the triterpenes, sesquiterpenes and monoterpene compounds of S. guaranitica mostly accumulated in old leaves, young leaves and roots, respectively? This question was difficult to answer before conducting the present work because there was a lack of information at the genetic level regarding the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway and how these compounds are synthesized in S. guaranitica.3.2. Illumina sequencing and the de novo assembly of the S. guaranitica leaf transcriptomeIn the past few years, the Illumina sequencing platform has become a powerful method for analysing and discovering the genomes of non-model plants.17,25In this context, to generate transcriptome sequences, complementary DNA (cDNA) libraries were prepared from leaf tissues of S. guaranitica, and cDNA was then sequenced using PE reads sequencing using an Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform. Previous reports involving Illumina sequencing reported that the use of PE sequencing showed significant improvement in the efficiency of de novo assembly and increased the depth of sequencing.10,26 The cDNA sequencing generated 4 Gb of raw data from S. guaranitica leaves. After filtering and removing the adapter sequences from the raw data, the number of reads was 32,862,861 (32.86 million), comprising of 186,299,510 high-quality nucleotide bases, with 96.32% Q20, 92.42% Q30 and 47.55% GC content. For further analysis, high-quality reads were selected, and the transcriptome was assembled using the Trinity program,18 which produced 179,369 transcripts with an N50 length of 1,603 bp, an N90 length of 462 bp and a mean length of 1,039 bp. Moreover, 61,400 unigenes could be detected with an N50 length of 1,334 bp, an N90 length of 277 bp and a mean length of 731 bp. The distribution of the assembled transcript length ranged from 200 to > 2,000 bases; the maximum number of transcripts (66,664 transcripts, 37.165%) ranged from 200 to 500 bp, followed by 48,716 transcripts (27.159%) ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 bp and then 40,323 transcripts (22.480%) ranging from 500 to 1,000 bp. On the contrary, the lowest number of transcripts (23,666 transcripts, 13.194%) was obtained for a size of more than 2,000 bp. In contrast, the assembled unigene lengths were distributed between 200 and > 2,000 bp. The maximum number of unigenes (37,659 unigenes, 37.165%) ranged from 200 to 500 bp, followed by 10,132 unigenes (16.501%) ranged from 500 to 1,000 bp, and then 8,777 unigenes (14.294%) ranging from 1,000 to 2,000 bp. Finally, the lowest number of unigenes (4,832 unigenes, 7.869%) was obtained for a size of >2,000 bp. The length distribution of the transcripts and unigenes are shown in (Supplementary Table S4 and Fig. S2). Our results are in agreement with those for Salvia officinalis, Boehmeria nivea, Curcuma longa, Medicago sativa, Centella asiatica and Apium graveolens in which the largest number of both transcript and unigene lengths were found to range between 75 and 500 bp.6,27,283.3. Functional annotation and classification of assembled S. guaranitica unigenesThe total number of unigenes (61,400, 100% of all unigenes) was compared against the NR, NT, KO, Swiss-Prot, PFAM, GO and KEGG annotation database (Supplementary Table S5 and Fig. S3). The annotation percentage results in this research were higher than the annotation percentages in other non-model plant studies (58% in Carthamus tinctorius and 58. 01% in C. lanceolata).11,29,30The international standardized gene functional annotation system (GO Annotation) provides a powerful way to recognize the functions and properties of sequences that have not been characterized for an organism.31 The BLAST2 GO program was used to categorize the functions of these annotated unigenes, and a total of 23,198 unigenes (37.78% of all of the assembled unigenes) were mapped to at least one GO term. Based on sequence homology, the unigene sequences from S. guaranitica were categorized into 47 functional groups under three general sections: 60,139 were assigned to the BP, 42,494 were assigned to the CC and 29,574 were assigned to the MF sections. As a result, cellular process (13,830) and metabolic process (13,253) were the most enriched GO terms in the BP section. Regarding the CC section, the cell (8,590) and cell part (8,553) were the most enriched. Within the MF section, binding (13,723) and catalytic activities (11,368) were highly enriched (Fig. 2). These results revealed that the main GO classifications in the annotated unigenes were responsible for metabolism and fundamental biological regulation. These results were similar to previous results with the S. miltiorrhiza, S. officinalis transcriptome, and with the transcriptome of O. sanctum and O. basilicum (members of the same family), which have the highest percentages of metabolic process, cellular process, cell, cell part, binding and catalytic activity.6,32,33 Moreover, these results are in agreement way with previous studies on de novo transcriptome assembly in the tuberous root of sweet potato, transcriptome sequencing from S. officinalis, de novo transcriptome sequencing from Raphanus sativus and de novo characterization of roots from the Chinese medicinal plant Polygonum cuspidatum.6,30,34 The lowest percentage of unigenes categories included channel regulator activity (66), extracellular matrix parts (54) and cell junction (25). Therefore, the present work suggests that the enormous potential data that exist in the GO classifications can be used to identify the new genes. Functional annotation and classification of assembled unigenes in S. guaranitica. GO terms are summarized in three general sections of the BP, CC and MF.Functional annotation and classification of assembled unigenes in S. guaranitica. GO terms are summarized in three general sections of the BP, CC and MF.3.4. KEGG analysis of S. guaranitica transcriptomesThe KEGG pathway database can facilitate the understanding of the functional annotations of enzymes and the biological functions of genes regarding their networks.8,35 To identify active biological functional pathways in the leaf tissues of S. guaranitica, all 61,400 unigenes sequences were mapped in reference to the canonical pathways of KEGG, but 9,163 (14.92%) unigene sequence were assigned to 260 KEGG pathways. Furthermore, all transcripts were classified into five larger pathways categories, including cellular processes, environmental information processing, genetic information processing, metabolism and organismal systems (Fig. 3). The highest number of transcripts from S. guaranitica could be assigned to the metabolism category, followed by genetic information processing, organismal systems and cellular processes, whereas the lowest number of transcripts was related to the category environmental information processing. Interestingly, 570 transcripts of S. guaranitica were related to the biosynthesis of various secondary metabolite pathways, which were sorted into 26 subcategories, with phenylpropanoid biosynthesis (ko00940), terpenoid backbone biosynthesis (ko00900) and carotenoid biosynthesis (ko00906) representing the largest subcategories (Supplementary Table S6). These results were in agreement with previous results from the transcriptome of S. officinalis, O. sanctum and O. basilicum, which are members of the same family, and from de novo transcriptome sequencing from R. sativus, the transcriptome of which had the highest percentages of phenylpropanoid biosynthesis and terpenoid backbone biosynthesis.6,7,30KEGG classified into five largest categories pathways includes cellular processes (A), environmental information processing (B), genetic information processing (C), metabolism (D) and organismal systems (E).KEGG classified into five largest categories pathways includes cellular processes (A), environmental information processing (B), genetic information processing (C), metabolism (D) and organismal systems (E).3.5. Genes related to the biosynthesis of isoprenoidsVarious types of terpenoids were found in the essential oil extracts of S. guaranitica. The mixture contained mainly a-pinene, camphene, laevo-ß-pinene, beta-pinene, 1,8-cineol, thujone, (-)-camphor, (+)-borneol, cis-a-terpineol, farnesan, (-)-beta-bourbonene, (E)-ß-elemene, ß-caryophyllene, humulene, (-)-germacrene D, pi-a-muurolene, d-cadinene, germacrene-A, ledol, a-cadinol, trans-longipinocarveol, trans-phytol, phytan, kauran-18-al, 17-(acetyloxy)-, (4.beta.)- and squalene. Precursor molecules for terpenoid biosynthesis are derived from the cytosolic mevalonate (Ac-MVA) and plastidial MEP pathways. Therefore, queries against the Lamiaceae family transcriptome libraries were applied to identify and to determine the genes that encode the enzymes involved in the different steps of the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway, such as, IPPS (isopentyl diphosphate isomerase), DMAPPS (dimethylallyl diphosphate isomerase), GPPS (geranyl diphosphate synthases), FPPS (farnesyl pyrophosphate synthases) and GGPS (geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases).36,37 Furthermore, we identified and estimated the expression levels of isoprenoid genes by using uniprot annotations against the transcriptome libraries (Table 1). From the annotation data analyses, we found many transcript genes related to isoprenoid biosynthesis from the MEP pathway with higher expression levels, including gene transcripts such as SgDXS1, 4 and 5 (1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate synthase 1, 4 and 5), SgDXR1 (1-deoxy-d-xylulose-5-phosphate reductoisomerase 1), SgMCT (2-C-methyl-d-erythritol 4-phosphate cytidylyltransferase), SgCMK (4-diphosphocytidyl-2-C-methyl-d-erythritol kinase), SgHDS 2 and 4 ((E)-4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl-diphosphate synthase 2 and 4) SgHDR 4, 6 and 9 (4-hydroxy-3-methylbut-2-enyl diphosphate reductase 4, 6 and 9), SgIDI 2 (isopentenyl-diphosphate delta-isomerase 2). Additionally, we obtained some gene transcripts that were related to isoprenoid biosynthesis from the MVA pathway with higher expression levels, such as, SgAACT 1 and 4 (acetyl-CoA C-acetyltransferase 1 and 4), SgHMGS (hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA synthase), SgHMGR 3 and 4 (hydroxymethyl glutaryl-CoA reductase (NADPH) 3 and 4), SgMVK (mevalonate kinase), SgPMK (phosphomevalonate kinase). Moreover, the transcriptome dataset of S. guaranitica presented other genes, such as SgGPPS, SgFPPS, and SgGGPS<U+0399><U+0399>2 that are the immediate precursor of the mono-, sesqui- and di-terpene biosynthesis pathway. The SgGPPS, SgFPPS and SgGGPS<U+0399><U+0399>2 genes were highly abundant in leaves and had higher values of fragments per kilobase of transcripts per million mapped fragments (FPKM), which were 47.81, 80.21 and 74.07, respectively (Fig. 4 and Table 1). Our results were similar to previously obtained results from the transcriptomes of S. officinalis, O. sanctum, O. basilicum and S. miltiorrhiza, which are members of the same family and have a higher number of transcripts for the isoprenoid biosynthesis genes related to the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway.6–8Representative terpenoid biosynthesis pathway with cognate heat maps for transcript levels of genes from S. guaranitica transcriptome data with substrates and products, coloured arrows connect substrates to their corresponding products.

Genes related to terpene synthesisPlants produce various terpenoid compounds with highly diverse structures. These compounds play an important role and functions in the interactions with environmental factors and in fundamental BPs.37,38 Multiple terpenoids are synthesized in plants by the expression of many terpene syntheses (TPSs) genes. Moreover, some TPS genes have the ability to catalyse the production of multiple products. Thus, the TPS genes family was classified according to phylogenetic relationships into eight subfamilies (TPS a, b, c, d, e/f, g and h), which comprises mono-, sesqui-, di- and triterpene synthases.39 Therefore, the annotation of transcriptome data from S. guaranitica against the Lamiaceae family and Arabidopsis revealed many terpene synthases involved in the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway, e.g. myrcene, (+)-neomenthol, 1, 8-cineole, (3S)-linalool, (E, E)-geranyl linalool, geraniol isomerase, farnesol, a-humulene, valencene, germacrene-A, cis-muuroladiene, selinene, gamma-cadinene, bicyclogermacrene, momilactone-A, gibberellin 3-beta-dioxygenase, gibberellin 2-oxidase, ent-copalyl diphosphate, ent-kaurene, ent-kaurenoic acid, 9 beta-pimara-7, 15-diene, ent-isokaurene C2-, gibberellin 20-, beta-amyrin, squalene, farnesyl- pyrophosphate and camelliol C. From the dataset, 69 TPS unigenes were identified and determined based on sequence similarities with a TPS sequence in the canonical annotation reference database. Twenty unigenes were annotated as being involved in monoterpene biosynthesis, including myrcene/ocimene synthase, (+)-neomenthol dehydrogenase, 1,8-cineole synthase, (3S)-linalool synthase, (E, E)-geranyl linalool synthase and geraniol isomerase synthase, and 12 other unigenes were annotated as being involved in sesquiterpene biosyntheses, including farnesol dehydrogenase, a-humulene/ß-caryophyllene synthase, valencene synthase, germacrene-A synthase, cis-muuroladiene synthase, germacrene-D synthase, selinene synthase, gamma-cadinene synthase and bicyclo-germacrene synthase. Additionally, 30 unigenes were annotated as being involved in diterpene biosynthesis, including momilactone-A synthase, gibberellin 3-beta-dioxygenase, gibberellin 2-oxidase, ent-copalyl diphosphate synthase, ent-kaurene synthase, ent-kaurenoic acid hydroxylase, 9beta-pimara-7, 15-diene oxidase, ent-iso kaurene C2-hydroxylase and gibberellin 20-oxidase. Finally, seven unigenes were annotated as being involved in triterpene biosyntheses, including beta-amyrin synthase, camelliol C synthase, squalene monooxygenase and farnesyl-diphosphate farnesyl transferase, but some of these previous genes showed high abundance in leaves and higher FPKM values (Fig. 4 and Table 2). The previous compounds have significant pharmacological activities, such as anticancer, anti-HIV, antiviral, anti-inflammatory and antibacterial activities.40 Sesquiterpenoids are similar to triterpenoids as both share the same origin and originate from FPP. Triterpenoid compounds originate from the conversion of FDP into squalene by squalene synthase (SQS) and then to (S)-2, 3-epoxysqualene by squalene monooxygenase (SQE). Subsequently, (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene is converted to beta-amyrin and camelliol C in the presence of multifunctional (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene cyclase via beta-amyrin synthase and camelliol C synthase, respectively. Similar reports about triterpenoid biosynthesis from (S)-2,3-epoxysqualene cyclases are available for O. basilicum and Catharanthus roseus.41,423.7. SSR discovery and analysisThe Illumina HiSeq 2000 system offers the opportunity to analyse molecular markers such as SSRs that are related to terpenoid pathway genes. SSR molecular markers have proven to be a powerful method for understanding genetic variation. Moreover, polymorphic SSR markers are very important for the investigation of related comparative genomics, genetic diversity, evolution, linkage mapping, gene-based association studies and relatedness. Even though SNP markers have become promising, especially for studying complex genetic traits and high-throughput mapping, SSRs provide many advantages compared with other marker systems. Hence, SSRs have become the preferable codominant molecular marker for a construction of linkage maps.43 Therefore, the development of novel SSR molecular markers for S. guaranitica plants could be a valuable tool for breeding studies and genetic applications. Therefore, SSR markers were identified from transcriptome sequencing data using MISA (MIcroSAtellite) (http://pgrc.ipkgatersle-ben.de/misa/misa.html). Of the 61,400 transcripts of S. guaranitica, 5,262 transcripts were observed to have SSRs (Supplementary Table S7). The total number of SSR-containing sequences in S. guaranitica was 5,931, following stringent selection criteria used to identify these SSRs. The analysis data showed that dinucleotide repeats were the most abundant motif type in S. guaranitica (2,787; 45.25%), followed by trinucleotide (1,555; 23.58%), mononucleotide (1,452; 23.58%), tetranucleotide (92; 1.493%), and hexanucleotide (28; 0.454%) types, while the pentanucleotide type was the least abundant motif (17; 0.276%) (Supplementary Table S8 and Fig. S4). Except for the absence of mononucleotide, these results were similar to the previous results obtained from the transcriptome of O. sanctum and O. basilicum (members of the same family), which have dinucleotide repeats as the most abundant motif type, followed by tri-, tetra-, hexa- and pentanucleotide types as the least abundant motif.7 After analysing the data from mono- to hexanucleotide motifs to obtain the number of repeat units, we found that the highest repeat unit of potential SSRs was 10, which accounted for 1,376 SSRs (27.08%), followed by 5 SSRs (1,049; 20.65%), 7 (728; 14.33%), and 6 (573; 11.28%), and the smallest repeat unit of potential SSRs was =24 (3; 0.0 5%) (Supplementary Table S9). The AG/CT dinucleotide repeat was the most prevalent motif detected in all SSRs (1,893; 30.73%), followed by A/T as a mononucleotide repeat (1,408; 22.86%). In contrast, the least abundant motif in all SSRs (3; 0.048%) was detected in (AAAAC/GTTTT/AAAAG/CTTTT/AAACC/GGTTT) as pentanucleotide repeat and in (AAACAC/GTGTTT/AAACGG/CCGTTT/AAAGAC/CTTTGT) as hexanucleotide repeat. Finally, several SSR motifs were associated with many unique sequences that encode enzymes (e.g. SgDXS1, SgDXR1, SgMCT, SgHDR9, SgIDI3, SgAACT1, SgHMGS, SgHMGR2, SgHMGR6, SgMVK2, SgGGPS<U+0399><U+0399>2, SgGibberellin 20-oxidase, SgBeta-amyrin synthase, SgSqualene monooxygenase and Sgfarnesyl-diphosphate farnesyltransferase) involved in terpenoid biosynthesis (Supplementary Table S10).3.8. Validation of the gene expression patterns by quantitative RT-PCRTo determinate the reliability of the Illumina HiSeq 2000 read analysis, 15 candidate genes with a higher differential expression were selected, and their expression profiles were compared within young leaf, old leaf, stem, flower, bud flower and root samples. Quantitative real-time (qRT) PCR was used to determine the ‘transcriptional control’ which indicates the number of mRNA copies of the enzyme that complements the end-product quantity. Therefore, the correlation between the TPS mRNAs with their products and the end-products showed a relationship between the chosen differentially expressed genes (DEGs), monoterpene synthase (SgGPPS; KX893917), sesquiterpene synthase (SgFPPS; KX893918), ß-caryophyllene (SgHUMS; KX893973), neomenthol synthase-1 (SgNEOD-1; KX893955), neomenthol synthase-2 (SgNEOD-2; KX893956), neomenthol synthase-3 (SgNEOD-3; KX893957), germacrene-A synthase (SgTPS-1; KX893975), selinene synthase (SgTPS-3; KX893978), germacrene-d synthase (SgTPS-6; KX893977), linalool synthase-1 (SgLINS-1; KX893965), linalool synthase -2 (SgLINS-2; KX893966), (E, E)-geranyl linalool synthase (SgGLNS; KX893967), geraniol isomerase synthase (SgGERIS; KX893968), valencene synthase (SgTPS-V; KX893974), farnesol dehydrogenase (SgFARD; KX893969) and the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway of S. guaranitica. SgACTIN was used as an internal reference gene (Supplementary Table S1). The expression patterns of the 15 selected DEGs in the young leaf, old leaf, stem, flower, bud flower and root samples were examined (Fig. 5) by qRT-PCR, and the results were consistent with the results from the Illumina HiSeq 2000 read analysis. At the current stage, we may be able to answer the question which terpenoid compounds of S. guaranitica accumulated mostly in which tissue. From our results, we found that the next gene, geranyl diphosphate synthase (SgGPPS) gene showed the highest expression levels in the young leaves, followed by roots, stems, old leaves, bud flowers and flowers. These results were nearly compatible with our GC-MS analysis data indicating that the main group of terpenes in roots, bud flowers and young leaves consisted of monoterpene. According to the findings of the GC-MS analysis, we found eight monoterpene compound are accumulated in the root, two monoterpene compounds in bud flowers and one monoterpene compound are accumulated in young leaves (Table 3).Therefore, we suggest that the roots are the primer site for monoterpene biosynthesis and accumulation, followed by, bud flower, and young leave. These results are not in agreement with6,44,45 that found that the main monoterpenes in some salvia plant species are formed and accumulated in very young leaves epidermal glands. Because, the formation of most epidermal glands and the accumulation of the monoterpenes, take very short time in young leave tissues. And our S. guaranitica plant has limited number from epidermal gland trichomes on old leave, young leaves and stem. Moreover, Sesquiterpene synthase (FPPS) gene recorded the highest expression levels in the root followed by flower, bud flower, young leave, old leave and stem. On the other hand, these results were not similar with GC-MS analysis data that showed that the main group of sesquiterpenes was mostly accumulated in young leaves. Which have five compounds followed by old leaves have 12 compounds, roots have four compounds, flowers have two and bud flower has one compound (Table 3). Besides, from our study, we found a correlation and linkage between the ß-Caryophyllene product and ß-Caryophyllene synthase genes expression level in different tissues. For instance, the highest of the ß-Caryophyllene synthase gene product and expression level presented in the young leaves followed by old leaves, roots then flowers (Table 3 and Fig. 1). Also, we found a correlation and linkage between the (-)-Germacrene D, Germacrene-A product and Germacrene-D synthase (TPS-6), Germacrene-A synthase (TPS-1) genes expression level in different tissues. Such as the highest of (-)-Germacrene-D, Germacrene-A gene product and expression level present in the young leave followed by old leave. Some of our results are in agreement with those of the previous studies6,44–53 that reported that the terpene quantity levels are thought to be mainly controlled transcriptionally thought producing the different TPS enzymes. (+)-Neomenthol dehydrogenase-1,-2,-3, TPS-3-Selinene synthase, Linalool synthase-1,-2, (E, E)-geranyl linalool synthase, Geraniol isomerase synthase, TPS-Valencene synthase and Farnesol dehydrogenase genes that were detected in the Illumina HiSeq 2000 reads and QRT-PCR but was not detected in the GC-MS analysis data. We suggest that this could be due to the cyclic expression of terpene synthases is under circadian control. Although, changes in transcript levels may not directly determine protein levels or enzyme activities due to possible posttranscriptional, post-translational or enzyme-regulatory mechanisms, the positive correlation between transcript levels and volatile emission suggests that changes in transcript level are an important determinant of scent production. Furthermore, the different rates of protein synthesis and proteolytic turnover and/or differences in protein modifications. And the secondary modification of monoterpene olefins (e.g. oxidation/glycosylation) or sequestration also could contribute to the monoterpene emission profile.54 The combination of the analysed data reads from Illumina HiSeq 2000, qRT-PCR and the GC-MS will pave the way to understand the complex mechanisms of controlling and regulating the diversity of terpene compound production. Quantitative RT-PCR validation of expression of terpene synthase genes selected from the DGE analysis in S. guaranitica. Total RNAs were extracted from old leaves, young leaves, stem, flower, bud flower and root samples and the expression of SgGPPS, SgFPPS, SgHUMS, SgNEOD-1, SgNEOD-2, SgNEOD-3, SgTPS-1, SgTPS-3, SgTPS-6, SgLINS-1, SgLINS-2, SgGLNS, SgGERIS, SgTPS-V and SgFARD genes were analysed using quantitative real-time. SgACTIN was used as the internal reference. The values are means ± SE of three biological replicates.Quantitative RT-PCR validation of expression of terpene synthase genes selected from the DGE analysis in S. guaranitica.

Functional characterization of terpene synthase genes in transgenic A. thaliana leavesTo test A. thaliana in a transgenic expression system for the production of Salvia terpenes, the following genes were selected from S. guaranitica: farnesyl pyrophosphate synthases (FPPS), geranyl diphosphate synthases (GPPS) and (3S)-linalool synthase (LINS) encoded by SgFPPS, SgGPPS and SgLINS, respectively. Transgenic A. thaliana was carried out by using the Agrobacterium-mediated floral dip method of A. thaliana flowers using A. tumefaciens strain EHA105 carrying pB2GW7-FPPS, pB2GW7-GPPS and pB2GW7-LINS under the control of 35S promoter vector. Fully mature leaves from fifteen 35-day-old putative transgenic plants and wild type plant (Fig. 6A), were collected for semiquantitative RT-PCR to analyse the positive transgenic A. thaliana and assessed the expression levels of terpene genes from the different samples (Fig. 6B). The terpenes were extracted with hexane and analysed by GC-MS. The mono-, sesqui- and di-terpene peaks were clearly detected, and the type and amount of compounds represented by the percentage of peak area (% peak area). Compounds were identified by comparing their mass spectra the compounds with mass spectra libraries. The detected components were also confirmed by comparing them with the published references and extracts of wild-type Arabidopsis which produce different types and amounts of terpenes. Overexpression of the SgFPPS, SgGPPS, and SoLINS genes produced different amounts from mono-, sesqui- and di-terpenes and other terpenoids. Moreover, from the results shown in Table 4 and Supplementary Fig. S5, we found that the transient expression of the different TPS genes from Salvia produced different types and amounts of mono-, sesqui- and di-terpenes and other terpenoid compounds. The major chemical compositions in transgenic A. thaliana leaves over-expressing of SgFPPS, SgGPPS and SgLINSMono, monoterpene; Sesqui, sesquiterpene; Dit, diterpene; –, the terpene and other compounds not detected.The major chemical compositions in transgenic A. thaliana leaves over-expressing of SgFPPS, SgGPPS and SgLINSMono, monoterpene; Sesqui, sesquiterpene; Dit, diterpene; –, the terpene and other compounds not detected.Overexpression of three S. guaranitica terpenoid genes in transgenic Arabidopsis.

(A) Comparison of the phenotypes of the transgenic A. thaliana and wild type A. thaliana. (B) Semiquantitative RT-PCR to confirm the expression of terpenoid genes.The putative functions of TPS genes isolated from S. guaranitica were initially predicted according to the conserved motifs using the InterPro protein sequence analysis and classification (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/) database. The SgGPPS protein with a 418-aa length has a metal-binding domain (IPR005630) from 74-418 aa; inside this domain are two motifs: both are DDxxD motif (DDVLD) one motif starting at 177 aa, and the other one is starting at 304 aa. Additionally, the SgFPPS protein is 349-aa length has a metal-binding domain (IPR005630) from 6-349 aa; inside this domain are two motifs: both are DDxxD motif one is (DDIMD) starting at 100 aa, and the other one is a (DDYLD) starting at 239 aa. On the other hand, the SgLINS protein is 541-aa in length, this protein has an N-terminal domain (IPR001906) from 69-279 aa and a metal-binding domain (IPR005630) from 270-540 aa, and inside the latter domain are DDxxD conserved motifs (DDIFD) starting at 347 aa Supplementary Fig. S6. Finally, the protein sequences contaned one or two of this domain belong to the terpene synthase family.Furthermore, Croteau and coworkers shed light on the carbocationic reaction mechanism for all monoterpene synthases by reporting that the reaction was initiated by the divalent metal ion-dependent ionization of the substrate. The resulting cationic intermediate undergoes a series of hydride shifts or other rearrangements and cyclizations until the reaction was terminated by the addition of a nucleophile or proton loss. Croteau and coworkers illustrated this reaction mechanism by studying the native enzymes with substrate inhibitors, analogues and intermediates.55,56 Moreover, Rodney Croteau et al.56 elucidated the preliminary conversion of the geranyl cation to the tertiary linalyl cation to facilitate cyclization to a six-membered ring. Afterward, the linalyl cation provides the cyclic a-terpinyl cation; this is an important branching point intermediate in the formation of all cyclic monoterpenes because multiple terpene products can be obtained through electrophilic attack of C1 on the C6–C7 linalyl cation double bond and from the a-terpinyl cation. From the previous discussion, the reaction mechanisms of monoterpene synthases are highly reticulate. The individual intermediate may have multiple fates, which suggests the explanation for the ability of terpene enzymes to make various terpene products.57–60 On the other hand, the carbocationic reaction mechanism that uses sesquiterpene synthase to form sesquiterpenes by catalysing FPP recycling is similar to the reaction mechanism by those monoterpene synthases. Moreover, the larger carbon skeleton of FPP and the presence of three double bonds instead of two suggest a rationale for increases of the structural diversity of the sesquiterpene products. Furthermore, the initial cyclization reactions for sesquiterpene synthases can be divided into two types. Type one involves cyclization of the initially formed farnesyl cation to yield 11-membered ((E)-humulyl cation) rings of large size and a C2–C3 double bond (this type has no barrier to cyclization). The second type involves cyclization that proceeds after the tertiary nerolidyl cation produced from preliminary isomerization of the C2–C3 double bond. This isomerization mechanism is directly analogous to the isomerization of GPP to yield a linalyl cation in monoterpene synthesis. The nerolidyl cation is considered an intermediate in the sesquiterpene synthase mechanism.61–65 Collectively, we can state that the ability of TPS genes to convert a prenyl diphosphate substrate into diverse products during different reaction cycles is one of the unique traits of this type of enzyme. As described above, this property is found in the majority of all characterized monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases. However, some monoterpene and sesquiterpene synthases can catalyse substrates into a single product, and the proteins may have specific methods for multiple product formations. For example, <U+03B3>-humulene synthase from A. grandis has two DDxxD motifs located on opposite sides and can generate 52 different sesquiterpenes. This protein is able to bind substrates with two different conformations and resulting in different sets of products.66 In another example regarding the first monoterpene synthase cloned from Salvia officinalis, (+)-sabinene synthase produces 63% (+)-sabinene but also 21% <U+03B3>-terpinene, 7.0% terpinolene, 6.5% limonene and 2.5% myrcene in in vitro assays.67 These additional monoterpene products or their immediate metabolites are also found in the monoterpene-rich essential oil of the S. guaranitica plant.4. ConclusionIn this study, a large, high-quality transcriptome database was established for S. guaranitica leaves using NGS technology to characterize and identify genes that are related to the terpenoid biosynthesis pathway. Using de novo sequencing and analysis of the S. guaranitica transcriptome data via the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system, we identified many genes that encode enzymes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. The purpose of identifying these genes is not only to facilitate functional studies but also to develop biotechnology for improving the production of medicinal ingredients through metabolic engineering. We profiled terpenoids from six tissues of S. guaranitica and used qRT-PCR to determine the correlation between the expression levels of TPS genes and the end-products. By combining the transcriptome and metabolome analysis with RNA-Seq or qRT-PCR with GC-MS approaches, this study paves the way for understanding the complex metabolic genes for the production of the diverse terpene compounds in blue anise sage. The results from our study will allow us to understand the specific activities of TPS in S. guaranitica for the production of interesting compounds and to develop new technology for utilization.To our knowledge, this is the first study used Illumina HiSeq 2000 PE sequencing technology to investigate the global transcriptome of S. guaranitica. The valuable genetic resource in salvia will provide the foundation for future genetic and functional genomic research on S. guaranitica or closely related species. We further studied the functions of various S. guaranitica TPS genes, including SgFPPS, SgGPPS and SoLINS, by expressing these genes in A. thaliana transgenic plants. SgFPPS, SgGPPS and SoLINS were successfully expressed in the leaves of A. thaliana, and these transgenes altered the levels of terpenoids, as confirmed by GC-MS analysis of extracted transgenic A. thaliana leaves. The GC-MS analysis revealed that these S. guaranitica terpenoid synthases isolated from S. guaranitica can convert a prenyl diphosphate substrate into diverse products, which is one of the unique traits of this type of enzyme. Our study provides new insights into our understanding of plant terpenoid biosynthesis and the potential for biotechnology application.AcknowledgementsThe authors thank Associate Professor.

IntroductionPrior to the development of next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods for aDNA sequencing, comparative analysis relied on the physical analysis of remains. The combination of increased quality from NGS technology as well as new methodology for reliable extraction and library preparation of ancient DNA (aDNA) samples has led to an influx of genomic studies of extinct species.1–6 Early genomic studies adopted mitochondrial genome sequence analysis representing a leap forward in evolutionary research. Until now, many such aDNA studies have been mostly limited to mitochondrial and small genome regions,7–11 given the problems with extraction of usable DNA in sufficient quantity.3,5,12–14 Recent advances have enabled amplifying enough nuclear DNA to allow for complete genome sequencing of ancient samples, although also leading to potentially compounding effects on coverage, quality, and contamination.3,4,12,15 Accuracy in these studies is especially important for comparative and evolutionary analysis against living species.1,6,12,16–20 Experimental and computational methods upstream of mutation calling were developed attempting to mitigate complications of aDNA sequencing including contamination from microbes and human handling, fragmentation, depurination, and deamination.3,12–15,19–29Such methods often rely on detecting degradation of aDNA due to extensive exposure to the environment and the physical handling of samples over time,12,22,23 which is used to differentiate between sample and noise.4,21,24–26 Filtering out contamination of contemporary DNA from aDNA samples uses short read lengths, as aDNA is often highly fractured; thus long read lengths are comparatively rare and likely a contemporary contaminant.2,13,21,26,27 Other features can be used for reducing error in aDNA studies, such as substitutions arising from depurination events frequently occurring before strand breaks,24 or deamination events often found at the ends of fragments.24,25 Compensation for these nucleotide change events is frequently made by masking such substitutions if they occur towards the end of reads.2,16Although these methods have been shown to decrease the bias caused by aDNA damage and contamination,3,4,21 there is yet to be a consensus method to address the issue of mutation calling. Typical approaches are often ad hoc extensions using existing algorithms, such as GATK.30 However, there is little similarity among these extensions in the filtering of read depth, quality, masking locations, or mapping characteristics.1,2,16–18,31 For example, recent publications on the sequencing of various woolly mammoth and ancient human whole genomes have all utilized differing methods in the quality control of sequencing reads despite working with similar datasets.31 Additionally, a study in Neandertal genomes has demonstrated that the use of GATK on even highly processed sequence data potentially yields inaccurate results.32Due to the variation of quality and quantity of usable DNA in ancient samples and divergent methods to extract the maximum amount of information, there can be large discrepancies in aDNA findings and interpretations.2,12,16–18,31 Many of the currently employed variant calling algorithms are utilized with limited validation of results or proof of efficacy due to the constraints of aDNA sample availability.Here, we introduce ARIADNA (ARtificial Intelligence for Ancient DNA), a novel approach for detecting single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) in aDNA samples. Given the lack of validated ground truth datasets for aDNA, it uses common and unique variants in multiple woolly mammoth genomes to train a predictive machine learning (ML) model. ARIADNA employs our fast GROM genome scanning engine33 to find all potential SNVs (PSNVs) found as deviations between sample and reference genomes and then utilizes a boosted regression tree algorithm for training and classification of potential mutation sites. The unique features of the corresponding sites are used by our algorithm to determine the difference between bona fide mutations in aDNA and noise due to aDNA degradation or contamination. We compared ARIADNA results on (i) woolly mammoth genomes with both the most commonly employed mutation caller, GATK, and a recently developed Bayesian model, AntCaller,34 (ii) the Altai Neandertal genome with GATK and AntCaller, as well as with SNV calls from two studies,1,32 and (iii) a simulated aDNA genome. Our comparisons demonstrate that ARIADNA provides the most accurate and comprehensive mutation call sets with stable nucleotide substitution frequencies and high call quality in these ancient genomes.2. Materials and methodsThe backbone of our method consists of a ML algorithm tailored for aDNA mutation calling by utilizing unique features found in aDNA samples. We implement the use of boosted regression tree models35 with the available python library, scikit learn,36 building a succession of additive decision trees to best classify known data (training set). The algorithm assigns thresholds for feature values used within the trees from given data of true positive (TP) and false positive (FP) calls in the training set. Through a series of these trees, prediction deviance from known truth is continually reduced. Our feature set is generated using a modification of our comprehensive mutation caller GROM33 to act as a genome scanner and output feature information at potential mutation locations. These features include common measures such as read depth, SNV count, read and base quality as well as features unique to aDNA, such as distance from read end, C<U+2192>T substitutions, and neighbouring mutation rates (Table 1). Once this series of trees is built from the training data, a model is constructed and classification of further data (known, for testing, or unknown, for implementation) can take place (Fig. 1). A hold back set of known mutations is used to test performance. The known values of the holdout set are not used in any way during training. Features used in the ML classification algorithmFeatures used in the ML classification algorithmThe design of the ML method for training and implementation.The design of the ML method for training and implementation.We tested our method on four woolly mammoth samples M4, M25, Wrangel Island, and Oimyakon.16,17 These samples originated from two different studies, with the M4 and M25 samples being suspected of experiencing high levels of problems associated with aDNA sequencing.31 WGS fastq files for woolly mammoths M4 and M25 were downloaded from the Sequence Read Archive (SRA), http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra (project accession number: PRJNA281811). WGS fastq files for the Wrangel and Oimyakon woolly mammoths were downloaded from the European Nucleotide Archive (ENA), http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ena (accession number: ERP008929). WGS fastq files were mapped to the African Elephant reference genome loxAfr3, downloaded from UCSC (https://genome.ucsc.edu, http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/loxAfr3/bigZips/), using BWA MEM, version 0.7.4, with default parameters. Duplicates were removed using SAMtools,37 version 0.1.19. ARIADNA, GATK, and AntCaller were run on the resulting alignment files using default parameters. We limited analysis to supercontigs/scaffolds =1,000,000 bases. PSNVs were detected using GROM, customized to include output of additional features from Table 1.Simulated aDNA was generated using Gargammel.38 Alignment data from scaffold_100 of the elephant Parvathy16 against the African Elephant reference genome was used to guide creation of the simulated aDNA sample. Variant sites to be used as a known validation were reported using SAMtools mpileup, before modification by Gargammel, and required a minimum variant allele frequency of 20%. Allele frequencies up to 70% were considered heterozygous and those greater than 70% homozygous. Six independent aDNA read simulations between 5× and 30× read coverage were constructed using Gargammel. The simulated aDNA reads were then aligned to the African Elephant reference genome loxAfr3 using BWA MEM as described above. ARIADNA, GATK, and AntCaller were run using default parameters. Comparison between the SAMtools output (pre-simulation) and the various caller outputs (post-aDNA simulation) were used to calculate the False Discovery Rate (FDR).Additional testing was performed on the Altai Neandertal chromosome 1,1 using BAM files hosted at Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (http://cdna.eva.mpg.de/Neandertal/altai/). Calls and feature information were produced by GROM. The VCF files produced by GATK and snpAD from the respective publications1,32 were used for comparison. These were downloaded from the hosted Neandertal files at Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology (for the 2014 dataset: http://cdna.eva.mpg.de/Neandertal/altai/AltaiNeandertal/VCF/, for the 2017 dataset: http://cdna.eva.mpg.de/Neandertal/Vindija/VCF/) to better observe mutation rates and nucleotide change frequencies. The GATK output was filtered, removing all listed “Low quality” calls from the vcf file before any comparisons were made. Further comparisons were made from 20 random genomes of the 1,000 Genomes Project;39 10 individuals from the European population group, and 10 individuals from the East Asian population group. These two groups are believed to be the contemporary populations that are most related to the Neandertals. Here mutation information was provided through the 1,000 Genomes Project VCF (ftp://ftp.1000genomes.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/ftp/release/20130502/).To identify variants affecting essential genes, a list of essential human genes was downloaded from the Online GEne Essentiality database (http://ogee.medgenius.info/browse/). Only genes designated as “essential” were used in the analysis. Variants found in these genes were uploaded to the Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (https://www.ensembl.org/vep) to categorize impact. The inbred region of the Neandertal genome analysed (chromosome 21: 17081807-35881807) was selected according to Prüfer et al.32Given the lack of validated aDNA datasets, we used two simplifying assumptions for the development of our training and testing sets. First, we considered PSNVs shared between all woolly mammoth genomes to be TP locations (we did not take zygosity into account when designing our datasets). Conversely, potential mutation locations that only occurred in a single individual were deemed FP. We reasoned that these two sets will contain large numbers of primarily TP and FP, respectively, sufficient to train an effective classifier. The shared PSNVs that occurred in all woolly mammoth samples served as validation that the mutation did not occur as a result of contamination, degradation, or sequencing artefact, as opposed to unique PSNVs. Additionally, the use of woolly mammoth training samples for this study (as compared with Neandertal or ancient human) reduced the risk of misrepresented calls due to misalignment or contamination by closely related human samples when analysing the Altai Neandertal genome.13,403. Results and discussion3.1 Mammoth genomesWe used GROM to scan the mammoth genomes for any evidence of difference with the reference genome. This yielded an average of one PSNV per 140 bp, i.e. between 18 million and 23 million locations per genome. Of these, 15 million PSNVs shared some evidence in all woolly mammoth genomes, while 6.6 million sites were unique to single woolly mammoth genomes. In the absence of validated SNV datasets, we used shared PSNVs as TPs and unique PSNVs as FPs (the remaining PSNVs were shared between 2 or 3 mammoths and not used for training). Although it is certain that some true mutations were picked up in the FP set, we reasoned that the effects of this mis-classification of events would be diminished due to the high frequency of real FPs among unique PSNVs. Additionally, the validation of TPs across four genomes should alleviate problems with mis-classification during application of the trained model. Mutation events shared between either two or three of the woolly mammoth samples were ignored in ARIADNA model training to eliminate excessive uncertainty.We utilized two woolly mammoth genomes from separate studies for the purpose of training our ML model, a specimen from Wrangel Island and an M4 sample (a noisy and potentially contaminated candidate). One million shared and one million unique PSNVs from each of the two woolly mammoths in our training set were selected at random, resulting in four million training sites total. For the test set we used the two additional woolly mammoths from each study, Oimyakon and M25, and examined the results from the largest contig (contig_0). The data from these two genomes are not used in any way as part of the training set in order to avoid over-fitting or learning the unique characteristics of all available SNVs. In contig_0, the Oimyakon and M25 samples contained 799,849 and 960,816 PSNVs, respectively. Our algorithm utilized a feature set (Fig. 1) from the GROM genome scanner and the boosted regression tree ML module implemented using scikit learn.36 This gave our algorithm 45 different features to utilize (Table 1). The parameters of the boosted regression trees algorithm in scikit learn were set to 200 trees in the construction of the classifier, and a learning rate of 0.01.ARIADNA identified 607,354 and 599,847 mutations in contig_0 of the Oimyakon and M25 woolly mammoth samples, respectively. Of these, 569,556 (Oimyakon) and 587,621 (M25) mutation sites are shared between all four woolly mammoths. Additional 32,050 (Oimyakon) and 87,130 (M25) mutation sites are shared with at least one other woolly mammoth. Only a small number of variants identified by ARIADNA in either woolly mammoth sample are unique, 5,748 (Oimyakon) and 12,226 (M25), making up 1.0% (Oimyakon) and 2.0% (M25) of all mutation calls.To compare our results with other methods, we also employed the commonly used GATK HaplotypeCaller30 and the more recently developed AntCaller34 on all available woolly mammoth genomes. GATK made more calls than ARIADNA (as we anticipated), while AntCaller made the fewest number of calls, with both GATK and AntCaller having the high proportion of low-support calls (Figs 2 and 3, Tables 2 and 3). In the Oimyakon sample GATK made 825,955 calls, a 36% increase over our method and AntCaller made 497,718 calls, an 18% decrease compared with ARIADNA. In the M25 sample, 1,214,873 calls were made by GATK, more than twice as many as ARIADNA, while AntCaller made the fewest number of calls, 432,188 (Table 3). However, the most drastic increase is in the number of calls made by GATK that had no evidence of a variant in any other woolly mammoth. For Oimyakon this was 47,663 mutations and 280,049 mutations for M25 (Fig. 2C). This comprised 5.8% and 23.1% of the calls GATK made in their respective genomes (Fig. 2A), a striking discrepancy, suggesting that GATK over-predicted mutations at a very high rate in ancient genomes, especially in datasets with substantial noise. Such over-prediction by GATK has also been noted in a recent study on Neandertals by Prüfer et al.,32 despite the comparatively high quality of NGS data in the Neandertal. A similar behaviour was seen in AntCaller, where only 65,004, or 13% of the calls in Oimyakon were unique, but in M25, 102,820, 23.7% of the calls made were unique.

A total of 20,000 randomly sampled calls from the Oimyakon (A, C, E) and M25 (B, D, F) mammoth genomes, binned by read depth (x-axis) and by share of supporting reads (SSR, y-axis), are shown for AntCaller (A, B), GATK (C, D), and ARIADNA (E, F). The size of each coloured point corresponds to the count of calls that were sampled with the given read depth/SSR combination. SSR y-axis ranges are coloured as blue [0.9–1.0], green [0.6–0.8], yellow [0.3–0.5], and red [0–0.2], to provide visual representation of large proportions of SNVs with low read evidence for SNV detected by AntCaller (A, B) and GATK (C, D), and much stronger read support for ARIADNA calls (E, F).Improvements in calling woolly mammoth variants with ARIADNA.

ARIADNA call sets were robust; we observed very little change in counts or proportion of nucleotide substitution types in either Oimyakon or M25 mammoths (Fig. 2B and D). Conversely, there were large discrepancies in the GATK predictions (>2.5-fold) in such counts between the woolly mammoth genomes (Fig. 2D).Further, we found that in the Oimyakon samples, nearly 99% of the mutations identified using ARIADNA were shared in at least one of the woolly mammoth samples, compared with 94% called by GATK and 87% by AntCaller. This was even more starkly contrasted in the noisier M25 dataset, where 98% of variants ARIADNA detected were common in all mammoths, unlike 77% for GATK and 76% for AntCaller. More surprisingly, in this noisy dataset the use of GATK resulted in 23% of total calls being unique to M25. When analysed with GATK and AntCaller, there was a large increase in rate for unique calls between Oimyakon and M25; from less than 6% to 23% using GATK and from 13% to 23% using AntCaller (Fig. 2A). The difference in the rate of unique calls between Oimyakon and M25 using ARIADNA methods was only 1.1% (Fig. 2A). Such robustness in predicted mutation rate strongly suggests that ARIADNA likely produced a more reliable call set in aDNA than that of either GATK or AntCaller, with the latter two producing the highest and the lowest variant counts in the noisy M25 (Tables 2 and 3).Finally, following an approach used to establish the high noise levels in the mammoth NGS data,29 we tested the quality of calls produced by GATK, AntCaller, and ARIADNA by comparing the share of reads supporting called SNVs in 20,000 randomly sampled calls of Oimyakon and M25 samples. In both cases GATK and AntCaller produced more calls with biased heterozygous read support and from lower coverage regions than ARIADNA (Fig. 3). This difference was noticeable in the Oimyakon sample (Fig. 3A, C and E), but it was quite substantial in the noisy M25 sample, where ARIADNA SNVs showed much higher read support versus those of GATK or AntCaller (Fig. 3B, D and F). We found that in the M25 mammoth, nearly 22% and 12% of the calls made by GATK and AntCaller, respectively, were of lower quality, i.e. had either <30% of reads supporting the call or originated from regions covered by <1/3 of the median number of reads (Table 3). In contrast, ARIADNA was able to filter out many heterozygous SNVs with biased read support in noisy aDNA data.We also tested all three algorithms on six simulated datasets (changing read coverage from 5× to 30×) generated from the genome data of the closest relative of mammoths, an Asian elephant16 using Gargammel.38 Over-prediction by both GATK and AntCaller was observed in simulated datasets across all generated coverages (Supplementary Fig. S1). The false discovery rate (FDR) of both GATK and AntCaller increased dramatically with decreasing read coverage, reaching or exceeding half of the total predictions at 5× coverage. The FDR of ARIADNA remained consistently low (some 500-fold lower than for the other tools, the highest being 0.001 for 5× coverage). Thus, ARIADNA outperforms both GATK and AntCaller not only in empirical datasets but also in simulated ones.3.2 Neandertal genomeWe then tested if our model could be applied to other genomes. We used the same ML decision tree that was constructed with the woolly mammoth training set to analyse the Altai Neandertal. As a first benchmark, we used GATK calls on Altai Neandertal. As a second benchmark, we used the call set produced on that genome by Prüfer et al. using snpAD.32 All three methods utilized the identical bam files produced by Prüfer et al. We then compared call sets of GATK, snpAD, and ARIADNA to the SNVs in two 1,000 Genomes Project populations (European and East Asian).Compared with these benchmarks of 379,115 GATK calls and 216,469 snpAD calls, ARIADNA made 272,990 calls, much closer to the number of mutations found in the two modern populations, 279,007 (European) and 283,776 (East Asian). This observation for all nucleotide changes also held true for each nucleotide change type, where ARIADNA consistently produced call sets that were most similar to the European and East Asian populations (Fig. 4).

Spectra of nucleotide changes in variant call sets are plotted for GATK (dark blue, Altai Neandertal analysis of 2014, ref. 1), snpAD (light blue, Altai Neandertal analysis of 2017, ref. 32), European individuals (dark grey, EUR), East Asian individuals (light grey, EAS) and ARIADNA (red).

(A) Share and (B) total number of specific substitution calls.Our results are consistent with the earlier observations32 that GATK, being sensitive to aDNA noise and degradation, tends to over-predict the aDNA mutations, producing more variants than any other methodology. On the other hand, the approach utilizing snpAD32 seems to overcompensate in stringency and therefore to under-predict SNVs, reducing the amount of variation to less than what is otherwise found in the modern human population. In contrast, ARIADNA reported nucleotide substitutions with almost the same relative frequencies as other callers (Fig. 4A) but with absolute numbers being much closer to the modern human variation (Fig. 4B).GATK made the greatest number of Neandertal SNV calls not made in any of the other algorithms tested here, 77,902, far ahead of snpAD, 3,374, or ARIADNA, 1,810. This was an expected result due to the reports of GATK being excessively sensitive, including noise-driven calls in its predictions.32 Neither ARIADNA nor snpAD made any common calls that were not identified by GATK. Similar to the behaviour in the woolly mammoth datasets, GATK had the highest proportion of calls made with lower coverage and lower read support, nearly 12% (Table 3), further indicating its sensitivity to aDNA noise, degradation, or contamination. Surprisingly, despite the least number of total calls made by snpAD, 4.64% of them also had low read coverage and low numbers of supporting reads, while ARIADNA produced the least number of such low-quality calls, 0.75% (Table 3).To further compare the quality of calls made by ARIADNA, snpAD, and GATK, we analysed calls that were unique for each algorithm in the Altai Neandertal genome in essential human genes41 and catalogued potential effects using VEP42 (Table 4, shared calls not shown). GATK made by far the most unique calls in such genes, including the greatest number of missense mutations, stop loss, and stop gains. ARIADNA made the lowest number of unique calls in essential genes, followed by snpAD, and neither of the two methods produced unique missense, stop loss, or stop gain variants. VEP-reported effects of algorithm-specific variants in essential genes of Altai NeandertalCalls made by all three algorithms are not included in the counts.VEP-reported effects of algorithm-specific variants in essential genes of Altai NeandertalCalls made by all three algorithms are not included in the counts.And finally, we evaluated the performance of snpAD, AntCaller, and ARIADNA in a large inbred region of chromosome 21 of the Altai Neandertal, where GATK has been shown to make an excessive number of heterozygous (and thus likely erroneous) calls, compared with snpAD.32 Showing further improvement in call quality (Table 5), ARIADNA made fewer heterozygous calls than snpAD or AntCaller inside of the inbred region, both in total number and proportionally, despite making a greater number of calls than either snpAD or AntCaller overall. Additionally, outside of this inbred region, ARIADNA identified a greater number of heterozygous calls, both in total count and proportionally, than snpAD, and close to that of AntCaller. Homozygous and heterozygous calls made within and outside of an inbred region of chromosome 21 of the Altai NeandertalHomozygous and heterozygous calls made within and outside of an inbred region of chromosome 21 of the Altai NeandertalTaken together, these comparisons demonstrate that ARIADNA trained on woolly mammoth genomes generated higher-quality SNV call sets in the Neandertal genome, when judged using both technical (read support and read depth) and biological criteria (fewest calls made in essential human genes and fewest heterozygous calls in inbred regions, with overall variation closest to other human samples). The ARIADNA model is intended for re-use and is available from Open Science Framework, https://osf.io/5bph4/.A combination of GROM and ARIADNA is also much faster than GATK and AntCaller (snpAD has not been released and was not available for testing). In a direct comparison,33 GROM was 12–25 times faster than GATK on a single thread and more than 70 times faster on 24 threads. In our tests, AntCaller was 10–20 times slower than GROM on a single thread, somewhat faster than GATK, as in earlier AntCaller comparisons with GATK.34 Using the output from GROM, ARIADNA classifier run took between 5.5 min (Oimyakon genome) and 14.5 min (Neandertal genome) on a single thread, a significant speedup compared with >60 h of GATK runtime (all timings were performed on an Intel Xeon E5-2690 v3 processor, 2.60 GHz, with 24 threads and 128 GB RAM). A one-time ARIADNA training run took 4 h to generate a model, thus it can be easily scaled as appropriate validated datasets become available.4. ConclusionARIADNA utilizes a comprehensive feature set, incorporating several features that are often used in ad hoc methods (Table 1). This includes identifying the position of the SNV within reads, base quality and mapping quality, nucleotide mismatch counts, and nucleotide change. We have also included novel features, such as accounting for nearby SNVs, adjacent nucleotides, and repeat regions, to better define difficult mapping regions or potential mutation hot-spots. The incorporation of several features as well as a decision tree ML model allows a dynamic level of filtering to compensate for changing NGS quality and read availability that is difficult to do with more static algorithms.In summary, ARIADNA yielded consistent proportions of shared and unique mutations in the two woolly mammoth datasets compared with GATK and AntCaller. The frequency of nucleotide substitutions was also more stable using ARIADNA on the two woolly mammoth genomes than that of either GATK or AntCaller. And ARIADNA showed some 500-fold lower FDR compared with the other two algorithms when tested on six simulated aDNA datasets based on the genome of Asian elephant, the close relative of woolly mammoth.Utilizing modern human variation from the 1,000 Genomes Project to compare results in the Altai Neandertal, we also found that the SNV calls made by ARIADNA were more consistent and potentially more relevant than calls of either GATK or snpAD. In the essential genes, ARIADNA made fewer Neandertal variant calls than either snpAD or GATK, and within an inbred region of the Altai Neandertal, ARIADNA made the lowest number of heterozygous calls.This testing suggests that the approach we used for ARIADNA is superior for variant detection in ancient genome samples and has the capability to build models that can be utilized with very fast runtimes for improved variant finding across a range of species and read coverages.5.

IntroductionGenomic imprinting is an epigenetic regulatory phenomenon in which there is allele-biased expression of certain genes depending on the parent of origin.1 Imprinted gene expression plays a role in fetal growth regulation and postnatal behaviour in mammals, formation of viable seeds and the inhibition of interspecies hybridization in plants.2–5In mammals, imprinting occurs in the placenta, embryo and adult tissues, while most imprinting in plants occurs in the endosperm.6–10 The seed of angiosperms comprises three major components, the seed coat, the embryo and the endosperm, which supports embryogenesis.11 There is evidence for cross-regulation between seed components. Seed growth and development require communication and coordination of distinct genetic programs that govern the development of each seed component. Among them, the endosperm plays a central role. The endosperm controls seed growth and allows transfer of maternal nutrients to the embryo. In certain species, including cereals, the endosperm stores reserves in the form of starch, proteins and lipids. In Arabidopsis thaliana and rapeseed (dicot), the endosperm is transient and is consumed by the embryo, which stores the seed reserves.12 Epigenetic regulation and imprinting are known to be vital for proper endosperm development and seed viability because mutations in the components of these regulatory circuits produce unviable seeds.13–17 Although imprinting was first discovered in maize (Zea mays) nearly four decades ago,18 studies of the phenomenon in plants have lagged behind those in animals for some time. Only a few of imprinted genes have been discovered in plants based on parent-of-origin–specific phenotypes associated with mutant alleles.7,8,13,15,19,20 The appreciation of the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in fundamental biological processes has increased recently. With the advent of high-throughput mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) technologies, genome-wide analysis of parental allele expression has become possible and led to the identification of hundreds of candidate imprinted genes in a number of plant species, including the model plant A. thaliana and several important crops, such as rice, maize, castor bean and sorghum, although the consequences of the imprinting remain largely unknown.21–27The molecular mechanisms underlying genomic imprinting generally involve epigenetic factors, including DNA methylation, histone modification, long non-coding RNA and sRNA.28 DNA methylation is a classic epigenetic mechanism which is associated with silencing of genes and transposable elements but can also promote gene activity.29–32 It has therefore been considered a major regulator of gene imprinting. Some imprinted genes, such as MEA,13,16,FWA,33,FIS234 and MPC,35 have been shown to be regulated by DNA methylation or demethylation in Arabidopsis. In recent years, genome-wide allele-specific DNA methylation maps together with the associated imprinted genes have been produced for seeds of Arabidopsis,36–38 rice39,40 and maize.25,41 Many but not all imprinted genes within differentially methylated regions (DMRs) show hypomethylation in maternal alleles and hypermethylation in paternal alleles, in which the hypomethylation of maternal alleles of imprinted genes may be mediated by DEMETER-LIKE activity across species.23,37,42,43 However, there is a great deal of variability between different plant species in terms of the imprinted genes, the proportion of imprinted genes controlled by these epigenetic marks and the role of the epigenetic marks for maternal and paternal alleles.26,27,44 Imprinted genes therefore need to be investigated separately in each species in order to decipher their epigenetic underpinnings.Rapeseed (Brassica napus L.), like Arabidopsis, belongs to the family Cruciferae. As the third largest source of vegetable oil globally, rapeseed is an important crop plant. Clarification of the genetic regulation involved in endosperm development would help to understand storage accumulation pattern in seed filling. Studies of imprinted genes in the rapeseed endosperm are therefore necessary. In addition, the seed is relatively large compared to Arabidopsis, making the rapeseed endosperm easy to be separated from the seed coat and embryo. Rapeseed thus provides an excellent system for identifying imprinted loci and characterizing parent-of-origin effects of imprinted genes in endosperm development. However, rapeseed is a tetraploid (4×) species derived from B. rapa (AA) and B. oleracea (CC), both of which underwent whole genome triplication. Although the rapeseed genome has been well annotated, the high degree of homology in the genomic sequences increases the difficulty of identifying imprinted genes in the endosperm.45–47In this study, using the genome of Zhongshuang 11 as reference sequence, we identified rapeseed imprinted genes and analysed their cytosine methylation levels. First, we performed deep mRNA sequencing and identified SNPs between two rapeseed lines, YN171 and 93275. Using YN171 and 93275 as parents, mRNA-seq libraries of reciprocal hybrid endosperm were constructed. Finally, based on the differential expression of parental alleles in the reciprocal endosperms, 183 imprinted genes with parent-of-origin-specific expression were identified. Further genomic DNA methylation sequencing showed that the imprinted genes used for cytosine methylation analysis were not associated with DNA methylation. Our study not only provided an opportunity to understand the mechanisms driving gene imprinting and seed development in rapeseed but also shed some light on the evolution and biological significance of gene imprinting in plants in general.2. Experimental procedures2.1. Plant tissue collectionRapeseed (B. napus L.) lines YN171, 93275, ZY036, 6F313 and 61616 introduced in our previous studies were grown in fields at Wuhan, China.48,49 Reciprocal inter-strain F1 hybrids, YN171 (<U+2640>) pollinated with 93275 (<U+2642>) (designated Y9) and 93275 (<U+2640>) pollinated with YN171 (<U+2642>) (designated 9Y) were produced by manual pollination in 2016. Other reciprocal inter-strain F1 hybrids including 93275 and ZY036, 93275 and 9T364, 93275 and 61616 were used for identification of imprinted genes.Endosperms for RNA-seq and DNA-seq were sampled from immature seeds 30 days after pollination (DAP), from the reciprocal F1 hybrids, both 9Y and Y9, and their parental lines, 93275 and YN171, in two biological replicates. Endosperms for RT-PCR were collected at 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 DAP separately. Each sample was collected from at least 10 individual plants. Other tissues, including leaf, stem, root, bud, pericarp, embryo and flower, were also sampled from YN171 line in two biological replicates. The endosperm was collected according to the method introduced by Li et al.50 To be specific, the seeds were kept on ice and punched rapidly at the top with a sharp steel needle to make a small hole. The prepared glass micropipette was immediately inserted into the hole and gently aspirated liquid endosperm from the embryo sac. Then the lipid endosperm was quickly transferred into EP tube on ice. All database related to the identification of rapeseed imprinted genes in this MS were uploaded to https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov (BioProject ID: PRJNA470566). A table including detailed information of database was also supplied (Supplementary Table S1).2.2. RNA-seq data generation and processingTotal RNA was extracted using a commercial kit (TaKaRa Mini BEST Plant RNA Extraction Kit). RNA quantity was measured using a NanoDrop (ND-1000, Nano-Drop). RNA-seq was performed in BGI. Specifically, libraries were constructed following the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Guide. The Agilent 2100 Bioanaylzer and ABI Step One Plus Real-Time PCR System (11 amplification cycles) were used for qualification and quantification of the sample libraries. Twenty million clean 150 bp paired-end reads from the parental lines and 34 million clean 150 bp paired-end reads from the hybrid lines were obtained, providing sufficient sequencing depth for the imprinting analysis. Low-quality reads were removed from the raw sequences and low-quality nucleotides were clipped from the beginning and the end of sequences using the trimmomatic-0.36 with Sliding Window 4: 15 and MINLEN: 130.51 The reads were mapped to the B. napus genome (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/brassicanapus/) using TopHat version 2.1.1 (-i 10–read-edit-dist 10).52 To obtain gene expression level in tissues, reads that were not uniquely mapped were excluded. To determine whether the SNPs identified strictly referred to the high similarity of paralogous genes in the tetraploid rape, we compared the diversity between species and paralogous genes by calculating the ratio between the variant sites (mismatch and small Indel) and covered length at both cDNA and DNA level. We note that 94% genes with larger variation between paralogous than between species, and more than 82% genes with significant variation (Fisher exact test, P < 0.05) which has enough sensitivity and specificity in SNP detection. For each gene, the expression level was measured by Reads Per Kilobase exon Model per Million mapped reads (RPKM).To obtain a more comprehensive list of SNPs between the parental orthologs, the genomes of the two parental samples were also re-sequenced. Reads from the genome samples were mapped to the genome of Zhongshuang 11 using BWA.53 Samtools (1.3.1) was used to exclude reads that were not uniquely mapped and pairs that were split across different chromosomes in all of the RNA and DNA analysis.54 In addition, duplicate reads were removed from the DNA analysis. Alignments from same parent were merged together for SNP identification.2.3. Identification of SNPs between parental orthologsA list of SNPs between YN171 (Y) and 93275 (9) was generated using the Samtools command Mpileup and the Bcftools program.54 First, a list of all positions containing potential variants and consistent sites with reference in exon regions for both YN171 and 93275 were generated. SNPs between YN171 and 93275 were filtered using the following criteria: (i) depth >=10 (at least 10 reads covering the SNP site), (ii) exclusion of heterozygous sites in each sample by retaining the sites with the alternative bases accounted for >95% of the reads.2.4. Identification of imprinted genesThe ratio of maternal to paternal alleles in hybrid endosperm is theoretically 2: 1, so the observed ratio of maternal versus paternal allele counts for each gene in Y9 and 9Y was used to perform a <U+03C7>2 test. Genes with a parental allele bias differing from 2: 1 (q < 0.05) in reciprocal hybrids were classified as potentially imprinted genes. Two replicates were considered separately and imprinted genes were identified as overlap among replicates. To identify the imprinted genes with greater confidence, more stringent standards were applied. In maternally biased endosperm genes (parental bias greater than 2: 1 at q < 0.05), criteria was set for at least 85% of the informative reads were maternal in both directions of the reciprocal cross. For paternally biased genes (parental bias less than 2: 1 at q < 0.05), criteria was set at least 50% of informative reads in both directions of the reciprocal cross were paternal. Genes that met these criteria in the reciprocal hybrids were defined as allele-specific imprinted genes.22 All statistical analysis was performed using R (version 3.2.1).55 Corrections for multiple testing were performed with Storey’s q-values of 0.05.562.5. DNA preparation and locus-specific sequencingGenomic DNA was extracted from parental leaf tissues (YN171, 93275) using a Qiagen DNeasy Plant Mini Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers used for SNP identification were designed manually (Supplementary Table S2). PCR was performed using TaqPlus polymerase (Qiagen). The PCR products were sequenced by Sanger sequencing.2.6. Gene expression analysis by RT-PCRTotal RNA from endosperms of reciprocal F1 hybrids and their parental lines was used for identification of putative imprinted genes. Approximately 800 ng of total RNA was used for cDNA synthesis using a reverse transcription (RT) kit (TransGen Biotech, Beijing, China) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RT-PCR primers were designed manually (Supplementary Table S2). The PCR products were sequenced by Sanger sequencing.2.7. Clustering analysisFor clustering analysis, 183 predicted imprinted genes were mapped to the rapeseed chromosomes (except for 4 genes, which could not be mapped to any chromosome). Arabidopsis imprinted genes were collected from the studies published in recent years.21,44,57,58 Sliding windows of 1 MB with step size 0.1 MB were used to compare the number of mapped reference genes and imprinted genes using a hypergeometric distribution. Consecutive significant windows (P < 0.05) were combined to form a cluster. The statistical analysis was performed using R (version 3.2.1).552.8. Gene MapMan analysisMapMan analysis of the imprinted genes was performed with the Classification SuperViewer on the website (http://bar.utoronto.ca/welcome.htm) based on sequence homology with Arabidopsis genes. Categories with P < 0.001 were classified as enriched categories. PEGs and MEGs at each significant level were analysed separately.2.9. Genomic DNA extraction and bisulphite sequencingGenomic DNA was extracted from endosperm at 30 DAP by CTAB method and bisulphite sequenced by BGI. Specific for, at least 1 µg of RNase-treated DNA was used for library preparation. The DNA samples were prepared according to the following treatments: The DNA, fragmented to 100–300 by sonication (Covaris), was purified with MiniElute PCR Purification Kit (QIAGEN) and incubate the tube at 20 °C with End Repair Mix. The fragmented DNA was purified and added a single ‘A’ nucleotide to the 3' ends of the blunt fragments. The purified genomic fragment was added with Methylated Adapter to the 5' and 3' ends of each strand and was purificated with QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (QIAGEN) and Then bisulphite treated with an EZ DNA Methylation GoldTM kit (Zymo Research). Finally, a narrow 350–400 bp size range after PCR with uracil-tolerant DNA polymerase for 10 cycles was purified with QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (QIAGEN). Libraries were subjected to QC on a bioanalyser before sequencing on an Illumina HiSeq2000 using 2 × 150 paired-end reads. Low-quality reads were removed and low quality nucleotides were clipped from the beginning and the end of sequences following the same procedure used for the RNA data. Processed reads were then mapped to both the Brassica napus reference genome and chloroplast genome using Bismark v0.16.3 with the following parameters: –non_directional -N 1 -L 32. The generated SAM files were then fed into the deduplicate_bismark subprogram for deduplication and the bismark_methylation_extractor subprogram to extract the methylations.59The average methylation level of MEG, PEG and non-imp gene were calculated as following method: Gene body regions were separated into 60 bins, and extended 5-kb up- and downstream regions were separated into 50 bins. The average methylation levels for each bin was calculated by the ratio of the methylated Cs/Gs and total number of Cs/Gs and Ts/As from all sites with more than four reads in each bin.602.10. Analysis and identification of pDMRsReads overlapping SNP were classified as maternal, paternal using custom Perl programs, in which C > T SNPs for forward reads and G > A SNPs for reverse reads were ignored. The reads from forward and reverse strand were merged together. The metilene was used to identify CG, CHG and CHH pDMR.61 Regions containing more than five CGs/CHGs/CHHs supported with at least four reads were further analysed and significant regions were kept (P < 0.05).Approximately 0.8–1.0 g of genomic DNA was used for bisulphite conversion using an EZ DNA Methylation GoldTM kit (Zymo Research) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primers were designed based on methylated sequences located on the regulatory regions and within rapeseed imprinted genes (Supplementary Table S2). Bisulphite-treated DNA was then amplified using HotStarTaq Plus polymerase (Qiagen). PCR products were cloned into a Peasy-Blunt Zero Cloning Vector (TransGen Biotech) for sequencing. At least 20 randomly chosen clones were sequenced for each gene, and the methylation levels were calculated as a percentage (%) per site for each CG type of cytosine residues.3. Results3.1. Genome-wide screening of putative imprinted genes in rapeseed endospermDuring rapeseed silique development, endosperm volume reached a maximum after about 30 DAP and then gradually decreased during seed maturation (Supplementary Fig. S1a). Therefore the developing endosperm tissues (30 DAP) from reciprocal hybrid seeds, Y9 and 9Y, were collected for screening imprinted genes using the method described in Li et al. (Supplementary Figs S1b and S2).50 To discriminate the parental origin of allelic expression in hybrids, a deep high-throughput RNA sequencing of endosperm libraries constructed from two rapeseed parents, YN171 and 93275, was first conducted to discover SNPs between the two varieties, yielding a total of about 80 million 2 × 120–150 bp paired-end clean reads. Additionally, genomic sequence data consisting of about 75 million clean 2 x 120–150 bp paired-end reads from the parents, which covered about 80% of the rapeseed genome, were also used for SNP identification. Although there are multiple homeologs in rapeseed, only 12.18–12.95% reads are matched to multi-places. The multi-matched reads were excluded during gene matching analysis firstly. In order to assess the matching reliability of specific region, the edit distances for both the best sites and the second-best alignment sites for each non-redundant read covered SNPs were compared. In all the reads covering SNPs in hybrid samples, about 37% reads were matched only one location. In the remaining reads, about 85% reads with best alignment showed great differences (edit distance>=3) compared with the second-best alignment. Totally, over 90% reads harbouring diagnostic SNPs between two parental could be matched to the corresponding genes (Supplementary Fig. S3). Finally, 176,464 high-quality SNPs in 25,115 genes between YN171 and 93275, which accounted for about 25% of all the rapeseed genes, were recovered for identifying and measuring allelic expression (Fig. 1A). To validate the accuracy of SNP analysis, 30 genes were chosen for SNP identification. Our analysis revealed the expected SNPs in all these 30 genes, confirming that we could accurately assess allele-specific expression in reciprocal hybrid endosperms (Supplementary Fig. S4).

(Fig. 1A). Based on saturation curve of rapeseed expression genes in every hybrid endosperm sample, sequence abundance is enough for imprinted gene analysis (Supplementary Fig. S5). The two replicates were considered separately and the imprinted genes were identified as overlap among two replicates. In total, about 14,394 genes covered by at least 10 reads could be assigned to a specific allele in both of the two reciprocal hybrid endosperms (Fig. 1A).Analysis of gene expression showed that most of genes with SNP sites in the maternal and paternal alleles had a 2: 1 allelic-specific expression ratio in four endosperm samples, indicating unbiased expression (Fig. 1B). A small proportion of genes (~3.8%) exhibited parent-of-origin differences in the expression of parental alleles in all samples. Among these, 267 genes exhibited maternally biased expression (MEG) and 26 genes displayed paternally biased expression (PEG) (Fig. 1A) in the reciprocal hybrids (<U+03C7>2 test, q < 0.05). These differentially expressed genes were considered as putative imprinted loci. To obtain a high-confidence list of imprinted genes, stringent standards were applied (for MEGs, >85% of the reads supporting expression originated from the maternal allele; for PEGs, >50% of the reads supporting expression originated from the paternal allele). Using these criteria, 183 candidate imprinted genes were identified. Interestingly, most of the imprinted genes identified in our mRNA-seq analysis exhibited partial imprinting (preferential expression of one allele) rather than complete imprinting (strict monoallelic expression). Of these imprinted genes, 167 genes were maternally expressed and 16 genes were paternally expressed (Fig. 1B, Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). We also found that when the gene was imprinted in one subgenome, the counterpart in another genome was not always imprinted. In all imprinted genes, only seven genes in A subgenome could be found to also be imprinted in C subgenome. Another 30 homologous with imprinted genes which have SNP and expression are not imprinted. Additionally, as an allotetraploid, B. napus also exhibits expression bias between the homoeologous from An and Cn genomes. For example, in the endosperms of 93,275, we found 8,401 gene pairs showing expression bias including 60 imprinted genes (Supplementary Fig. S6; Table S3).3.2. Validation of imprinted rapeseed genesTo determine whether the imprinted genes in rapeseed are conserved in other species, the rapeseed imprinted genes were compared with the known imprinted genes identified from other plants. The results showed there were 16, 2, 2, 1 and 1 rapeseed imprinted genes which were also imprinted in Arabidopsis, sorghum, castor bean, maize and rice, respectively (Table 1). Overlaps between rapeseed imprinted genes and those of Arabidopsis, sorghum, castor bean, maize and rice.Overlaps between rapeseed imprinted genes and those of Arabidopsis, sorghum, castor bean, maize and rice.In addition to the imprinted genes which have been reported in other species, it is necessary to confirm the accuracy of some other imprinted genes identified in rapeseed. However, because of high homology between the An subgenome and Cn subgenome in rapeseed, it is very difficult to separate the imprinted genes from its homologs by designing specific primers for most of rapeseed genes. By analysing differences in the sequences and expression of the imprinted genes and their homologs, 11 MEGs and 1 PEGs with nearly complete imprinting were screened for confirmation of the putative imprinting by measuring their allelic-specific expression patterns. RT-PCR and sequencing analysis with the total RNA from 30 DAP hybrid endosperm showed that the expression patterns of these 12 tested imprinted genes were consistent with the mRNA-seq results (Fig. 2A).

The genes which had the same SNPs that were found between YN171 and 93275 were identified to be imprinted in the other reciprocal hybrid combinations (Supplementary Fig. S7), leading to the conclusion that the predicted imprinted genes were subjected to genomic imprinting and, furthermore, that mRNA-seq analysis was a reliable method to identify parent-of-origin-specific gene expression.3.3. Characterization of imprinted genes in rapeseedTo further characterize the imprinted genes in rapeseed, the allele-specific expression pattern of 5 of those 16 imprinted genes were analysed at earlier and later stages of endosperm development based on RNA-seq analysis. The five imprinted genes maintained their imprinting pattern at the different developmental stages, at five different time points, 15, 20, 25, 30 and 35 DAP. This result suggested that imprinted genes maintained stable regulation of expression during the development of rapeseed (Supplementary Fig. S8).Furthermore, previous studies have found that most imprinted genes in plants show specific or preferential expression in the endosperm.24 To test whether this is true in rapeseed, transcriptome sequencing data was used to analyse the expression pattern of the validated rapeseed imprinted genes in other tissues of YN171, including the leaf, stem, root, bud, pericarp, embryo and flower. Figure 2B and C shows the results of clustering analysis of MEGs and PEGs based on their expression in eight tissues. Unlike some earlier studies, only about 13% (22 of 167) of the maternally imprinted genes and about 37.5% (6/16) of the paternally imprinted genes were expressed specifically or preferentially in the endosperm in rapeseed, and in most cases the expression was elevated in the endosperm but not endosperm specific (Supplementary Table S5). No obvious difference was found between MEGs and PEGs in terms of expression patterns. These findings suggested that most of the rapeseed imprinted genes might not be functionally restricted to the endosperm.In mammals, imprinted genes often lie in clusters and expression is controlled by an imprinting control region.62 To further investigate whether the imprinted loci in rapeseed were located within clusters, the 183 imprinted genes were mapped onto the 19 rapeseed chromosomes. Sliding windows of 1 MB with step size 0.1 MB were used to compare the number of mapped reference genes and imprinted genes using a hypergeometric distribution. Consecutive significant windows (P < 0.05) were combined to form a cluster. Altogether, 34 clusters were identified to be located into the chromosome. A total of 89 imprinted genes accounting 48.6% (89/183) of the total imprinted genes were clustered suggesting that nearly a half of the imprinted genes may have regional regulation (Fig. 3). Each cluster contained two to six genes (Supplementary Table S6). We showed the representative genome browser shots of two large clusters, c12 and c34 (Supplementary Fig. S9). Detailed information including imprinted genes and non-imprinted genes in every cluster was showed in Supplementary Table S6. These clusters might represent genes controlled by common cis epigenetic regulatory elements. To compare the clustered imprinted regions between rapeseed and Arabidopsis, we analysed 593 Arabidopsis imprinted genes and found that 405 genes were located within 14 clusters. By collinearity analysis to the cluster regions between rapeseed and Arabidopsis, 16 rapeseed clusters were overlapped with 11 Arabidopsis clusters, which suggests that high consistency of imprinted regions exist in rapeseed and Arabidopsis (Supplementary Table S7). Chromosomal location of rapeseed imprinted genes. A total of 34 clusters (protrusions in red lines) containing 2–6 imprinted genes were identified.Chromosomal location of rapeseed imprinted genes. A total of 34 clusters (protrusions in red lines) containing 2–6 imprinted genes were identified.3.4. Functional annotation analysis of the imprinted genesTo annotate the function of the rapeseed imprinted genes, the protein sequences encoded by these genes were used to search the homologous Arabidopsis proteins by BLASTP. When the GO biological process annotations of the imprinted genes were assessed, the 183 rapeseed imprinted genes (q < 0.001) were allocated into several biological processes, including other biological processes, response to abiotic or biotic stimulus, response to stress, transport, other metabolic processes, other cellular processes and protein metabolism (Fig. 4A). The molecular functions were enriched in receptor binding or activity, transcription factor activity, other enzyme activity, transporter activity and transferase activity (q < 0.001). MapMan analysis showed that genes related to the hormone metabolism, cell wall, transport, lipid metabolism, secondary metabolism, misc and development were enriched (P < 0.001) (Fig. 4B). Additionally, over 50 imprinted genes were predicted to localize in nucleus and showed binding activities and regulation of transcription functions suggesting that many targets of rapeseed imprinting might have important regulatory roles. Further functional analyses of rapeseed imprinted genes will be necessary to shed light on the functional consequences on seed development.

Association analysis between allele-differential cytosine methylation and imprinted gene expression in rapeseedTo analyse the association of allele-differential cytosine methylation and imprinted gene expression in rapeseed, bisulphite sequencing to the genomic DNA from endosperm at 30 DAP was performed to assess the patterns of DNA methylation of both maternal and paternal alleles of imprinted loci. The chloroplast genome was used to estimate the bisulphite conversion rate. We found the average methylation levels of CG, CHG and CHH were 1.39%, 0.625% and 0.51%, which showed the bisulphite conversion rate of genome sequence exceeded more than 98%. The methylation level from 5 kb upstream to 5 kb downstream of genes was analysed to investigate the DNA methylation pattern around CG, CHG and CHH residues. No significant difference was found in DNA methylation patterns of MEGs, PEGs and non-imprinted genes in CG methylation levels in the four endosperm samples originating from YN171, 93275 and the reciprocal hybrids. The overall CG methylation level was higher in PEGs than that in MEGs. However, the CG methylation level of PEGs was not significantly different from that of non-imprinted genes, although the overall levels of DNA methylation in the upstream regions of PEGs were slightly higher (Fig. 5A). At CHG and CHH residues, the methylation levels showed obvious difference in parents. CHG methylation levels showed similar in MEGs and PEGs and both of them exhibited slightly but statistically significant lower levels than non-imprinted genes, while CHH methylation levels had no significant difference between imprinted genes and non-imprinted genes (Fig. 5B and C). To eliminate the effects of non-additive gene expression in polyploidy rapeseed, we screened the homoeologous gene pairs showing signi<U+FB01>cant differences in CG methylation and found 1294 gene pairs showing an inverse correlation between degree of methylation and gene expression. Among them, although 10 imprinted genes are found, most of them showed low methylation level in both of An and Cn homoeologs (Supplementary Fig. S10, Table S8).

(B) Average DNA methylation levels of MEGs, PEGs and non-imprinted genes (non-imp) in CHG context throughout the gene body and its 5-kb upstream and downstream regions.In order to detect allele-specific methylation of a gene, it must have sufficient read coverage of both the maternal and paternal genomic alleles in regions with at least one SNP between YN171 and 93275. A total of 104 genes (93 MEGs, 11 PEGs) met this criterion. Of these, seven MEGs and four PEGs showed coherent differential CG methylation between the two parental alleles in reciprocal hybrid endosperm DNAs (Supplementary Table S9). Of the 11 genes with differential CG methylation, 6 DMRs were located within the gene, 4 located at upstream region and 1 located at downstream. The identified DMRs ranged from 72 to 493 bp in length. Surprisingly, contrary to the studies in other plants, seven identified DMRs in rapeseed imprinted genes exhibited low CG methylation rates no matter in maternal alleles or in paternal alleles and had no big difference between parent alleles. Among the other four genes with higher CG methylation rates (BnC04g0675620, BnA09g0355640, BnA04g0165340 and BnA10g0421660), only BnC04g0675620 showed obvious differential methylation levels. To further confirm the reliability of methylation analysis, two genes including 1 MEG (BnA03g0127610) and 1 PEG (BnC08g0868840) were chose to investigate allele-specific methylation patterns. The results indicated that 2 genes showed difference in methylation states between parental alleles, which was coincident with the results from bisulphite sequencing data (Supplementary Fig. S11). Taken together, we found 1 gene (BnC04g0675620) showing high methylation levels in at least 104 imprinted genes. Additionally, lower methylation levels of CHG and CHH were found in some imprinted genes, which showed no great difference between parent alleles (Supplementary Table S9).4. DiscussionAs a result of the increasing focus on the importance of epigenetic mechanisms in fundamental biological processes together with the rapid advancement of RNA-seq technologies, studies of imprinting in diverse plant species, especially in several important crops, have intensified in recent years.25–27,63 At present, with the exception of Arabidopsis and Capsella rubella, there have been no studies on gene imprinting in the endosperms of Cruciferae species.64 Rapeseed is an important oil crop, and a genome-wide survey of imprinted genes in rapeseed endosperm may improve our understanding of storage accumulation and offer another model system for seed development. The first step toward understanding the biological functions of imprinting is to identify a large set of imprinted genes in a given species, although imprinted genes may differ between species and even between different strains within a species.57In this study, we applied high-throughput mRNA-seq analysis with highly stringent selection criteria and identified 167 MEGs and 16 PEGs from hybrid rapeseed endosperms originating from YN171 and 93275. Although imprinted genes are well conserved in mammals, it is obvious that the overlap of imprinted genes in different plant species is rather limited.23,27 Even between Capsella rubella and Arabidopsis, which share a common ancestor ~10–14 million years ago, only about 14% of the MEGs and 29% of the PEGs were found to overlap.64 In our study, although limited overlap of identified rapeseed imprinting genes with other plants supports less conserved imprinting in plants, among the 16 genes overlapped with Arabidopsis imprinted genes, BnC05g0699760, the homolog of Arabidopsis FIS2, was the most well-known imprinted gene in Arabidopsis.65,FIS2 in the endosperm is initiated and established by DME-mediated active DNA demethylation in the central cell, while the paternal alleles remain methylated and silenced.34 Unfortunately, we could not confirm if the homolog of FIS2 on A05 chromosome is also imprinted because of SNP absence. BnA04g0178370, BnA04g0178970 and BnC04g0675620 are homologs of Arabidopsis JMJ15. JMJ15 is closely related to JMJ14, which is thought to demethylate trimethylated lysine 4 of histone H3 (H3K4me3) and is involved in DRM2-mediated maintenance of DNA methylation.21Previous studies have not conclusively resolved whether imprinting of genes is conserved across the different stages of seed development. Xin et al.66 showed that MEGs and PEGs in maize exhibited distinct patterns of gene imprinting during endosperm development, with PEGs predominantly detected at 7 DAP and MEGs predominantly detected at 10 DAP. In castor bean, most of the 19 imprinted genes (17 MEGs and 2 PEGs) were found to maintain their imprinting pattern throughout endosperm development.26 In this study, the imprinting status of 5 rapeseed imprinted genes across the 5 developmental stages of endosperm from 15 to 35 DAP were highly similar, suggesting that imprinting occurs early and persists in the rapeseed endosperm.In plants, the proportions of MEGs and PEGs showing preferential expression in endosperm were dramatically different in maize (61.5% MEGs and 76.5% PEGs) and sorghum (96.7% MEGs and 93.7% PEGs).25,27 However, our analysis showed that most of the rapeseed imprinted genes (66% MEGs and 67% PEGs) were also expressed in other tissues, rather than endosperm specific. The difference between our findings and previous studies might be due to the number of tissues analysed. Only four other tissues were analysed in maize and five in sorghum, while we used seven other tissues in rapeseed. This conjecture was further supported by our finding that about 30% of the imprinted genes were expressed in only two or three tissues. In castor bean, where measurements were made in a range of tissues, including the leaf, stem, root, male and female flower, embryo and endosperm, the expression of 67% of the MEGs and 17% of the PEGs was observed in other tissues.26 These results suggest that most imprinted genes also play important roles in the development of other tissues.Gene expression within a cluster is often orchestrated by a common imprinting control region.67 Although physical clustering is a hallmark of imprinted genes in mammals, this does not appear to be a consistent characteristic in plants. The proportion of clustered genes in plants is highly variable. In Arabidopsis, 21 of 208 (10%) and 18 of 66 (27%) imprinted genes showed evidence of clustering.44,68 In maize, only 2 clusters including 4 genes were found in a set of 100 imprinted genes (4%),23 however, clear clustering of 74 of 217 (34%) imprinted genes and non-coding RNAs was observed from the same reciprocal hybrids between the two parental lines (B73 and Mo17).68 An analysis of 100 sorghum imprinted genes revealed that only 28 genes (28%) were grouped in 12 clusters. Unlike the results reported in other plant species, we found that 48.6% of the identified imprinted genes in rapeseed formed 34 distinct clusters, although the clustering criteria we used were similar to those in other studies. This suggested that clustering might play a role in imprinted gene regulation in rapeseed as it is in mammals.In some other plant species, most of DMRs identified are uniformly hypomethylated in maternal alleles and hypermethylated in paternal alleles.26–68 In maize, the identified DMRs have an average of 14% CG methylation in maternal alleles and 94% in paternal alleles.68 In castor bean, the average is 9.6% in maternal alleles and 86% in paternal alleles.24 In this study, among the 104 genes (93 MEGs, 11 PEGs) that cytosine methylation levels could be analysed, 4 PEGs showed differential CG sites with the average CG methylation rates of over 30% in maternal alleles and about 3% in paternal alleles. Only one MEG showing differential methylation levels exhibited high CG methylation rates. Additionally, we also found over 5000 non-coding RNAs in 93275 and YN171. By analysing the locations and expression levels of the non-coding RNA, we found 1 RNA showing exonic overlap on the opposite strand with BnC03g0568040 gene and 14 RNAs locating near 9 imprinted genes (the distance is about 1~40 kb) (Supplementary Table S10). However, all the RNAs nearly do not affect the expression of imprinted genes. Because DNA methylation is a classic epigenetic mechanism and has been considered a major regulator of gene imprinting, the methylation mechanisms of imprinting in rapeseed imprinted genes is worth being investigated further.Authors’ contributionsJ.L. and W.H. conceived the research plans; H.L. analysed the sequence data; S.F. performed the experiments; S.S., X.Z. and Z.H. provided technical assistance; J.L. and J.L. wrote the article.This study was supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (2016YFD0100500), the National Key Basic Research Program of China (2015CB150200) and National High Technology Research and Development Program of China (2013AA102602).Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary data"

IntroductionDNA replication must be coordinated with the cell cycle and cell division to ensure that chromosomes are faithfully replicated once and only once per cell cycle. This is carried out by overlapping mechanisms that control the activity of replication origins and replication enzymes for initiating DNA strand opening and recruitment of the replication machinery at origins every cell cycle.1–3It has been known for several decades that replication is also subject to a metabolic control. In steady-state bacteria, this control couples the rate of replication to the rate of growth afforded by nutrients by modulating the initiation frequency and/or the speed of replication forks.4–7 The net result is a precise and reproducible timing of DNA synthesis in the cell cycle across a wide range of nutritional conditions. Intriguingly, this timing primarily depends on the energy and precursors extracted from nutrients rather than on the actual nature of the carbon and nitrogen sources, as Escherichia coli cells growing at the same rate in different media exhibit similar temporal replication patterns.5 The temporal control of replication in the cell cycle defines two major periods: the C period, which corresponds to the time taken to replicate the chromosome, and the D period, which corresponds to the time between termination of DNA replication and cell septation. At the growth rates analysed in this study (1–3 doublings/h (db/h)), the C and D periods are rather constant in E. coli5,7 while they substantially vary in Bacillus subtilis8 (see below). In chemostat cultures of Saccharomyces cerevisiae and possibly higher eukaryotes, the metabolic control confines DNA synthesis to the reduction phase of a redox metabolic cycle that is repeated several times per cell cycle.9–11Despite a long history of investigation, the exact nature of the determinants involved in the metabolic control of replication remains elusive. Equally elusive is the mechanism at play and the way it acts in concert with classical control functions of replication initiation. The long-standing hypothesis is that the metabolic control of replication depends on the concentration of the active form of the replication initiator (DnaA–ATP) or on restricting DNA polymerases activity by limiting precursor concentrations. However, these concepts have been recently challenged.12–14 Moreover, several groups argue that this control is a multifactorial process, which varies with nutrient richness and may involve sensing the cell’s metabolism and communicating it to the replication machinery.15–18 One example of such signalling involves the guanosine tetra- and penta-phosphate [(p)ppGpp]. This nucleotide analogue signals the metabolic status of bacteria and accumulates under nutritional stresses to inhibit the initiation or elongation phase of replication19–22 and to impair the activity of the DnaG primase, an enzyme that synthesizes the short RNA primers used by DNA polymerases to replicate genomes.23,24 However, although the replication inhibitory activity of (p)ppGpp at high concentration is well established, its role in DNA synthesis at low concentration (that is in the absence of nutritional stress) is still in debate.13,25Central carbon metabolism (CCM) extracts the precursors and energy needed for macromolecular synthesis and biomass production from nutrients. This breakdown process involves about 30 key reactions that are highly conserved across the phyla. CCM is fed at various positions by different metabolites and the metabolite entry point determines the polarity of the carbon flux travelling through it, either glycolytic or gluconeogenic. The CCM catabolic reactions are grouped in pathways of which glycolysis, gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle form the main routes for breaking down nutrients (see the schematic representation in Supplementary Fig. S1). By directly sensing the supply and the demand in biosynthetic reactions, CCM is in a strategic position for producing signals that cells may use for adapting the main cellular activities to nutrient richness as recently demonstrated for cell division in E. coli and B. subtilis.26–28A role for CCM in replication was first suggested in the model organisms B. subtilis, E. coli and S. cerevisiae by a series of related genetic studies that analysed the viability of thermosensitive replication mutants at high temperature in cells compromised in CCM genes. In B. subtilis, this analysis uncovered strong genetic links between the 3-carbon part of the glycolysis/gluconeogenesis pathway (i.e. gapA, pgk, pgm, eno and pykA see Supplementary Fig. S1) and three replication enzymes, namely the DnaC helicase, DnaG primase and DnaE polymerase.29 Significantly, these three replication enzymes are loaded early at oriC during the initiation of replication and form a ternary complex in the replisome to carry out DNA melting and lagging strand synthesis.30,31 This would make these enzymes good target candidates for modulating replication initiation and elongation in response to changes in CCM activity. In E. coli, studies have uncovered strong genetic links between pta, ackA and genes encoding pyruvate dehydrogenase subunits (lpdA and aceE) (Supplementary Fig. S1) and the replication initiator protein DnaA, linking CCM to initiation.32–34 In the budding yeast, three glycolytic enzymes (HXK2, ENO2 and PGM1) were found genetically linked to MCM135 a multifunctional protein required for the stable maintenance of minichromosomes that binds DNA sequences to stimulate initiation of DNA synthesis and to regulate transcription of genes involved in diverse cellular functions including replication and the cell cycle.36 Other, independent, studies further support the hypothesis of CCM-replication links. For instance, an alteration of replication initiation was detected in cells defective in the glycolytic enzymes GapA, PykA and PdhB in B. subtilis13 and several CCM genes were found to be important for replication in eukaryotic cells.37–40 The CCM-replication link may even be more complicated as a striking inter- and intra-cellular diversity in E. coli and B. subtilis metabolism was found41 and we hypothesized that DNA replication may influence cell’s metabolism.42 To get insights into how CCM is linked to replication in B. subtilis, we analysed here the coupling between growth and replication in a library of 25 CCM mutants cultivated in three different rich media.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strains and plasmidsStrains and plasmids are listed in Supplementary Table S1. B. subtilis cells were grown at 37°C in LB supplement or not with malate 0.2% or in minimal medium (K2HPO4: 80 mM; KH2PO4: 44 mM; (NH4)2SO4: 15 mM; C6H5Na3O7 2H20: 3, 4 mM; CaCL2: 50 mM; MgSO4: 2 mM; FeIII citrate: 11 µg/mL; MnCl2: 10 µM; FeSO4: 1 µM; FeCl3: 4 µg/mL; Trp 50 µg/mL) supplemented with glucose 0.4%, casein hydrolysate 0.2%, malate 0.4%, glutamine 0.4%, proline 0.4% and/or succinate 0.4%, as listed in Supplementary Table S2. Unless stated otherwise, antibiotics were used at the following concentrations: spectinomycin (Sp, 60 µg/mL); kanamycin (Km, 5 µg/mL); erythromycin (Em, 0.6 µg/mL); chloramphenicol (Cm, 5 µg/mL); phleomycin (Pm, 10 µg/mL). Liquid cultures were performed in a water bath under strong shaking (200–230 rpm). The LB medium is a complex rich medium that supports steady-state growth at OD600nm <0.3 and a gradual decrease of the growth rate up to saturation (OD600nm > 3).43 The regimen is glycolytic in the first part of the growth curve as shown by direct measurement of the activity of promoters sensitive to the glycolytic (gapA promoter) and neoglucogenic (pckA and gapB promoters) carbon flux.29The E. coli plasmid pMUTIN2-Pm is a derivative of pMUTIN2 (EmR)44 in which the erm gene was replaced by a Pm (pmr) marker. The plasmid pLJH88 and pLJH89 were constructed by replacing the small HindIII-NheI fragment of the E. coli plasmid pDR111 (SpcR)45 by PCR HindIII-NheI fragments produced from pALS1046 and containing the relAt or relAi ORFs preceded by a ribosome-binding site, respectively. The relA constructions were then inserted at the amyE locus of the B. subtilis chromosome by double crossover event to permit RelAt and RelAi expression from the IPTG-dependent Pspank promoter. The plasmid pLJH90 is a CmR derivative of pLJH88. It was constructed by replacing the spc-containing HindIII-SacII fragment of pLJH88 by the cat-containing HindIII-SacII fragment of pDG1661.47 The plasmids pLJH92 and pLJH93 are derivatives of pMTLBs72 which is a low (6) copy number, CmRB. subtilis plasmid.48 They contain at the SmaI site a PCR fragment generated from pLJH88 or pLJH89 and containing the relAt or relAi gene under the control of Pspank. The pLJH160 plasmid is a pMUTIN2 (EmR) derivative in which the small EcoRI-BamHI fragment was replaced by an EcoRI-BamHI PCR fragment containing the C-terminal region of pykA fused to a 12 bp long linker and the FLAG tag (5'AGCGGTAGCGGTGACTACAAAGACGATGACGACAAA3'). Upon insertion in the chromosome by single crossover, B. subtilis encodes a PykA protein tagged with FLAG. The plasmid pLJH162 is a pMUTIN2 (EmR) derivative in which the small EcoRI-BamHI fragment was replaced by an EcoRI-BamHI PCR fragment containing the C-terminal region of gapB fused to the 12 bp long linker and the FLAG tag. The gapB region contains in addition a point mutation that inactivates the catalytic site of GapB (151SCT>AAA; TCATGCACC>GCGGCTGCA). The insertion of the plasmid in the B. subtilis chromosome by single crossover results in the production in an inactive, FLAG-tagged GapB protein. Plasmids pLJH198 and pLJH199 are derivatives of the E. coli pJL87 (CmR)49 that harbours between the HindIII-NheI restriction sites, a PCR fragment containing the 5' end of gapB or pckA, respectively. Once inserted in the B. subtilis chromosome by single-crossover, the gapB or pckA gene are expressed from Phyper-spank, an IPTG-dependent promoter. The pLJH200 plasmid is a pDR111 (SpcR) derivative45 in which a HindIII-NheI PCR fragment containing the B. subtilis pgk ORF and its ribosome binding site was inserted between the corresponding restriction sites of the recipient plasmid. This plasmid allows insertion of the pgk gene at the amyE locus by double crossover and the inserted gene is expressed from the IPTG-dependent Pspank promoter. The plasmid pLH206 is a pLJH200 derivative in which the spc marker was replaced by a cat gene. This was done by inserting between the LguI-EcoRI restriction sites of pLJH200 a LguI-EcoRI PCR fragment containing the cat marker of pMTLBs72.48 Plasmid constructions were carried out using the In-Fusion® HD Cloning kit (Clontech, France) and Stellar E. coli competent cells (Clontech, Saint-Germain-en-Laye, France). Constructions were checked by DNA sequencing. B. subtilis strains were constructed by transforming competent cells with genomic or plasmid DNA as indicated in Supplementary Table S1. The genotype of the transformants was controlled by PCR, phenotypes analysis and/or DNA sequencing.2.2. Quantitative PCRWild-type cells cured of prophages (TF8A) and containing or not CCM mutations were grown overnight in different liquid media in triplicates (with a very few exceptions, the three independent cultures were inoculated with different constructs). Saturated cultures were then diluted 500-fold in the same media and growth was carefully monitored using spectrophotometry. Samples for qPCR analysis were collected at low cell concentration (OD600nm 0.1–0.15) to ensure that cell cycle parameters are determined in steady-state cells and are not affected by the approach to the stationary phase or by changes in medium composition. The genomic DNA was extracted using a standard procedure29 and every qPCR reaction was carried out using two technical repeats of 4–5 serial dilutions. A non-replicating control DNA (stage II sporlets50) was analysed simultaneously to the samples in about 1/3 of the qPCR plates. Primers for the marker frequency analysis (see Supplementary Table S3 for details) were used at 200 nM in 12 µl of the 1× SYBR qPCR Premix Ex Taq (Tli RNaseH Plus) (Ozyme, St Quentin en Yvelines, France) and DNA amplification was carried out as follows: denaturation: 95°C, 30s; amplification: (33 cycles) 95°C, 5 s and 60°C, 1 min. For every qPCR reaction, the primer efficiency (97 to 103%) was controlled. The ori/ter ratio of the non-replicating sporlets was 0.585 +/– 0.019, a value consistent with the size of the PCR products (Supplementary Table S3). The amplifications were carried out on a Mastercycler® ep realplex (Eppendorf, Le Pecq, Fr) and the <U+0394>Cq were determined automatically from the cycle threshold.The pgmIP and enoLP metabolic mutants (DGRM353 and DGRM354, respectively) are thermosensitive (Supplementary Fig. S2). To determine the effect of these mutations on cell cycle parameters, the following procedure was followed. The strains were precultured over-night at 30°C in triplicates, diluted 1,000-fold for growth at restrictive temperature (47°C for pgmIP and 45°C for enoLP) and cell cycle parameters (growth, ori/ter ratio and the C period) were determined as above. Results (Supplementary Table S4) were then used to calculate the corresponding parameters at 37°C. For this, we first analysed the effect of temperature on growth, the ori/ter ratio and C period of the wild-type (TF8A), <U+0394>ytsJ (DGRM350) and <U+0394>ytoI (DGRM360) strains (these mutations are present in the pgmIP and enoLP strains, Supplementary Table S1). Results showed that temperature has nearly no effect on the ori/ter ratio while it changes the growth rate and the C period in a similar way in the three strains (Supplementary Fig. S3), as expected from previous studies.13,51 They in addition showed that the <U+0394>ytsJ and <U+0394>ytoI mutations have no effect on the growth-ori/ter ratio coupling (compare data Supplementary Fig. S3 37°C with Figs 1 and 2). The equation of the slopes Supplementary Fig. S3 were then used to derive the cell cycle parameters of the thermosensitive CCM mutants at 37°C (Supplementary Table S5). Growth-replication coupling in wild-type cells. Cell cycle parameters of wild-type cells (TF8A) growing exponentially for more than 10 generations in different media were determined: cell growth was monitored by spectrophotometry, the ori/ter ratio and C period by qPCR and the number of origins/cell as well as the D period by flow cytometry (see the text and Materials and Methods section for details). Left panel: ori/ter ratios and C periods plotted against growth rates. Right panel: numbers of origins/cell and D periods plotted against growth rates. The equations of the ori/ter ratio and C period curves (dotted lines) are: y = 1.0942e0.4469x and y = –4.0435x + 52.835, respectively. The ori/ter ratio and number of origins/cell are means of at least three independent replicates (SD/means <10%). The C periods were determined from representative experiments using 18 loci scattered on both arms of the chromosome and the D period was calculated from the number of origins/cell and the C period as indicated in the text.Growth-replication coupling in wild-type cells.

Primer pairs, their positions on the chromosome map and the size of the PCR products are given Supplementary Table S3. Results were reported to the terC signal and corrected for the size of the PCR products. The C period was extracted from the slope of the straight line of the plot (log2Nm)t against m where Nm is the relative copy number of a sequence N at position m (with 0 < m < 1 along the ori-ter axis) and t the generation time in minutes.52 Control experiments showed that the marker frequency of the different loci in the non-replicating DNA was close to 1 (1.011 +/– 0.045) as expected. Similar data were obtained with primers on the right and left arm of the chromosome.2.3. Flow cytometry analysisStrains were grown as indicated in the previous section and at OD600nm 0.1–0.15, chloramphenicol (200 µg/mL final) was added to the cultures to impede replication initiation, cell division and allow completion of ongoing rounds of replication.53 After 4–6 hours of drug treatment, 108 cells were fixed in filtered ethanol 70% and stored at 4°C. Stored cells were then washed in filtered 0.1 M of phosphate buffer (PB) pH 9, resuspended in 1 mL of Tris-buffered saline buffer (TBS 150, filtered) (20 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 150 mM NaCl) and stained with Hoechst 33258 (1.5 µg/mL) for at least 30 min as described elsewhere.51 Flow cytometry analysis was performed using a MoFlow Astrios cell sorter (Beckman Coulter, Life Sciences) equipped with a 355 nm krypton laser and a 448/59 nm bandpass filter used to collect Hoechst 33258 fluorescence. Data were analysed with the Kaluza software (Beckman Coulter, Life Sciences). We counted 50,000 to 100,000 events. In most of the tested samples, DNA histograms showed 1–2 main peaks with a 2n distribution. The number of origins/cell was obtained from the proportion of cells with 1, 2, 4, 8 and/or 16 chromosomes.The D period was calculated from the equation D = [(ln(ori/cell)t/ln(2)] – C where t is the generation time and C the C period.542.4. Suppression assayThree independently constructed mutants containing a dna(Ts) and the ackA deletion were grown overnight in LB at 30°C. Appropriate dilutions were then spread on solid LB medium and incubated at permissive (30°C) or restrictive temperature as indicated previously.292.5. Microscopy analysisFor analysing the production of filament in dna(ts) mutants, cells were grown overnight at 30°C in LB and diluted 500-fold in the same medium for further growth at permissive or restrictive temperature.29 After 2 hours of incubation, cells were collected and the nucleoid was stained with 4',6'-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI, 10 µg/mL) (Sigma). For analysing the effect of (p)ppGpp production on cell size, relevant strains were grown at 44°C in LB in the presence of different concentrations of IPTG. After about 10 generations of growth and at OD650nm = 0.4, cells were collected and the membrane was stained by FM5-95 (Biotium Inc, Fremont, CA). Stained cells were then mounted on glass slides (VWR) covered with 1.2% agarose (low melting point, Sigma) in minimal medium supplemented with malate 0.2% and casa 0.2% and a 0.17 mm glass coverslip (VWR) was placed on top. The microscopy was performed on an epifluorescence microscope (Zeiss, Axio Observer.Z1) with a ×100 magnification oil-immersion objective (Plan-APOCHROMAT Ph3) and a CMOS camera (Orca Flash 4.0 LT Hamamatsu). Digital images were acquired and analysed using Zen 2012 software. All experiments were independently performed at least three times and representative pictures are shown.2.6. (p)ppGpp analysisThe (p)ppGpp production in WT cells and (p)ppGpp mutants was analysed before and after induction of the stringent response by serine hydroxamate for E. coli and arginine hydroxamate (250 µM) for B. subtilis) as previously described.552.7. ß-Galactosidase activityThe ß-galactosidase activity encoded by the bgaB gene of B. stearothermophilus was measured as described previously.563. Results3.1. Growth-replication coupling in wild-type cellsA hallmark of growing populations of E. coli and B. subtilis cells is the concurrent increase in the rate of growth and DNA synthesis.5 This coupling implies that (i) bacteria growing slowly in poor carbon sources host a chromosome that either is not being replicated or is undergoing a single round of replication while (ii) fast-growing bacteria in rich media contain multi-forked chromosomes undergoing up to three overlapping replication cycles. To characterize in more detail the growth-replication relationship in B. subtilis, we quantified cell cycle parameters of a wild-type strain growing at rates ranging from 0.5 to 3 doublings per hour (db/h) in different media. This strain (TF8A) and the derivatives used below, are free of prophages to avoid any interference of phage induction on chromosomal replication.57 Growth was assessed by spectrophotometry, and DNA replication by marker frequency using qPCR. In the latter analysis, the amount of replication terminus (ter) sequences was compared with the amount of 18 other loci regularly scattered along both arms of the chromosome and including the replication origin (ori). This gave us two major replication parameters: the relative copy number of ori versus ter sequences (the ori/ter ratio) and the C period. This latter parameter was extracted from the slope of the straight line of the plot (log2Nm)t against m where Nm is the relative copy number of a sequence N at position m (with 0 < m < 1 along the ori-ter axis) and t the generation time in minutes.52 The results show a strong positive correlation between growth and the ori/ter ratio, as expected5,6,13,51 (Fig. 1, left panel, Supplementary Table S2). They also show a significant negative correlation between growth and the C period: the time taken to replicate the chromosome increases from about 40 to 50 min when the growth rate decreases from 3 to 0.5 db/h. Calculation of the C period (C) from the ori/ter ratio and t using the formula ori/ter = 2C/t58 confirms this negative correlation (Supplementary Table S2).To get further insights into the growth-replication relationship, the number of origins/cell and the D period of the wild-type cells grown in various media were measured by flow cytometry. To that goal, we first analyzed the size of events detected by the flow cytometer in order to discriminate single cells from the chains of cells that often accumulate in fast growing B. subtilis cultures. This entailed using density plots of area versus width of fluorescence signals generated by cultures stained with a DNA specific dye (Hoechst 33258). Representative results are presented Supplementary Fig. S4 (left panels). The width axis corresponds to the flight time of particles through the laser beam spot. It reveals small (S) and large (L) events and that the proportion of large events strongly increases (from 1 to up to 60%) with the medium richness and growth rate. The area axis gives the integral of fluorescent signals. It shows that the intensity of fluorescence signals of small events varies while that of large events is rather constant and strong. Taken together, these results show that small events correspond to single cells while large events correspond to cell-chains and/or to clump of cells.The samples used to measure the number of origins/cell and the D period corresponds to exponentially growing cultures treated for 4–5 hours with Cm. This treatment allows completion of ongoing replication cycles but prevents re-initiation of new rounds of replication and cell division.53 Hence, at the end of the treatment, cells contain an integral number of fully replicated chromosomes that corresponds to the number of origins at the time of drug addition (replication run-out assay). It is of interest to note here that the proportion of cell-chains in Cm-treated cultures is greatly reduced (to 1–5%) as shown by density plots in Supplementary Fig. S4, right panels. DNA histograms of Cm-treated, single cells (Supplementary Fig. S5) show a smooth increase (from 2 to 6) of the number of origins/cell at growth rates ranging from 0.5 to 2 db/h followed by a stronger increase and a plateau to 9 origins/cell for cells growing at rates >2 db/h (Fig. 1, right panel and Supplementary Table S2). The D period, calculated from the equation D = [(ln(ori/cell)t/ln(2)] – C,54 varies with the growth rate in B. subtilis as expected8 (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S2).Overall, the cell cycle parameters determined here show that the coupling between growth and replication in B. subtilis cells growing at rates >0.5 db/h depends on a concerted modulation of the initiation and elongation phases of replication. In agreement with E. coli studies,5 they also support the hypothesis that this coupling depends on the precursors and energy extracted from nutrients rather than on the nature of available carbon sources.3.2. Identification of CCM genes important for the growth-replication couplingTo look for a possible involvement of CCM in the growth-replication coupling, we analysed cell cycle parameters of CCM mutants grown in rich media and compared the results with data obtained for the wild-type strain grown in different carbon sources. We assumed that this approach is relevant as coupling depends on the energy and precursors extracted from nutrients and not on the amount and nature of nutrients available in the environment (see above). This assumption is further supported here by a coupling analysis in B. subtilis cells extracting energy and precursors from a rich medium (LB) at different rates because of inhibition of ribosome production. Such an assay was developed in E. coli using cells expressing a truncated form of the E. coli (p)ppGpp synthetase RelA from an inducible promoter. This truncated protein (termed RelAt) synthesizes constitutively the inhibitor of ribosome synthesis (p)ppGpp without the need for metabolic stress and binding to idling ribosomes.59,60 This genetic system was proved to modulate E. coli growth rate and cell size in LB in an inducer-dependent manner. To develop a similar approach in B. subtilis, the E. coli relAt gene was inserted in the B. subtilis chromosome and put under the control of an IPTG inducible promoter. A related strain expressing an inactive form of E. coli RelA (RelAi) was constructed as a control. As in E. coli, an inverse correlation between (p)ppGpp production, growth rate and cell size was found in B. subtilis (see Supplementary data and Supplementary Fig. S6). Measurement of the ori/ter ratio shows a wild-type coupling over the large range of growth rates generated by degrees of (p)ppGpp production in LB (Supplementary Fig. S7). Hence, B. subtilis sets the replication rate according to the growth rate determined by its metabolism and not by the richness of the growth medium. It is thus reasonable to compare data from wild-type cells grown in various media to data from CCM mutants grown in rich media. This underpins our hypothesis that CCM mutants growing at various rates in rich media will have a wild-type growth-replication relationship unless the metabolic mutation alters cell cycle parameters.We used a library of 25 CCM mutants and three rich media to analyse the growth-replication coupling in 53 metabolic conditions. The mutations correspond to deletions (16), point mutations (5) or inducible transcriptional fusions (4). They decrease or abolish the activity of 19 genes (i.e. two-thirds of the key CCM genes; see Supplementary Table S1 for details on the strain library) that map in glycolysis (ptsG, pgi, gapA, pgk, pgm, eno and pykA), gluconeogenesis (pckA and gapB), the pentose phosphate pathway (zwf), the TCA cycle (citC and mdh), the overflow pathway (pta and ackA) and in the pyruvate metabolism (pdhB, pdhC, ytsJ, pycA and pps) (see the CCM map Supplementary Fig. S1 for details). The rich media (LB; LB + malate and the minimal medium + malate + casa – casein hydrolysate) feed both the upper and lower parts of CCM and support growth of mutants at rates ranging from about 0.5 to 3.5 db/h (see Materials and Methods and Supplementary Table S5 for details) (note that the <U+0394>pdhB and <U+0394>pdhC strains did not grow in malate + casa and that the <U+0394>pgi mutant was not analysed in LB and LB + malate as cells had abnormal shapes in these media – not shown).The growth rate, ori/ter ratio and C period in the 53 metabolic conditions were measured and compared with curves typifying the growth-replication coupling in wild-type cells (Fig. 2, top panels and see Supplementary Table S5 for details). Based on the SD/mean of experiments (<10%), we assigned the metabolic conditions into one of three classes. The first class (class I) contains the majority of conditions (34/53) and the growth-replication coupling appeared to be wild-type as the ori/ter ratio and the C period deviate by less than 20% from the typical wild-type curves. The second class (14/53) (class II) contains the conditions associated with a significant alteration of the growth-replication coupling with both the ori/ter ratio and the C period deviating by 20–120% from the typical wild-type curves. The third class (5/53) (class III) contains conditions in which a mixed phenotype is observed: the metabolic mutants exhibit a defect in only one replication parameter (the ori/ter ratio or the C period). Flow cytometry analysis shows that metabolic conditions conferring a class II phenotype at 37°C are also often associated with an increase in the number of origins/cell but not with a major change in the D period (this is of importance as changes in the D period may affect the growth-replication coupling by altering the timing of replication initiation) (Supplementary Fig. S8) [note that (i) mutations—pgmIP and enoLP—conferring a class II phenotype at high temperature were not analysed and that (ii) this analysis was limited to conditions conferring a growth rate =2 db/h as the growth-origins/cell reference curve is inaccurate at higher growth rates (Fig. 1, right panel)].Taken together, the results show that the alteration of the growth-replication coupling in CCM mutants cultivated in rich media mainly results from an early firing of replication initiation and/or from a decrease in the mean velocity of fork progression. Hence, CCM is important for DNA replication. As initiation and elongation defects perturb replication cycles, our results suggest that a balanced CCM activity is needed for a normal timing of DNA replication in the cell cycle. Significantly, we did not observe a consistent correlation between reduced growth and replication defect indicating that a mere alteration of CCM activity and cellular metabolism is not sufficient to alter replication (Fig. 2).Eleven CCM genes appear to be important for replication in rich media (Fig. 2, bottom panels). These genes are located in the main routes of carbon source degradation: the 6- and 3-carbon part of glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, the pentose phosphate pathway and the overflow pathway. Interestingly, the sets of genes important for replication differ from one medium to another with some genes being involved in just one medium (zwf, pgi, gapA, gapB, pta and mdh), and others being involved in two (pgk, pykA and ackA) or in three (eno and pgm) media (Fig. 2, bottom panels). It can thus be inferred that CCM is connected to DNA replication through multiple links that are committed in replication in a medium manner.3.3. CCM mutations affect the initiation or elongation phase of replicationTo determine which replication step is defective in CCM mutants, we constructed a series of strains replicating their genome from a plasmid replicon rather than from the chromosomal origin oriC. The replicon used (termed oriN thereafter) originates from the low copy-number plasmid pLS32. It encodes an initiator protein RepN that binds the plasmid origin embedded in the repN gene to initiate replication.61,62 In addition to RepN, initiation at oriN depends on the host-encoded factors DnaD, DnaB (two helicase loaders), DnaC (the helicase) and DnaN (the DNA polymerase clamp). It is however independent of the initiator DnaA and the oriC sequence.63 Once assembled at oriN, the initiation proteins (RepN, DnaB, DnaC and DnaD) recruit the rest of the chromosomal replication machinery to carry out bidirectional replication. In the series of strains constructed here, the plasmid replicon was inserted 2 kb to the left of the chromosomal origin and normal initiation of chromosomal replication was inactivated by introducing three ochre mutations into the DnaA-encoding gene or by deleting oriC sequences.63,64The plasmid replicon used responds poorly to differences in carbon sources13 (see below). This means that if uncoupling between growth and replication in CCM mutants were to result from changes in initiation (i.e. the productive interaction of DnaA with oriC), cells replicating their genome from the plasmid replicon would not suffer from the metabolic mutation and would thus exhibit the coupling of oriN-dependent cells, wild-type for metabolic functions. In contrast, if uncoupling were to result from changes in DNA elongation (or in an initiation event downstream of the formation of an active DnaA/oriC complex), plasmid replicon-dependent cells would still suffer from the metabolic mutation and would thus not exhibit the coupling typical of the CCM+, oriN-dependent cells (i.e. growth and replication would be uncoupled).We first analysed the growth-ori/ter coupling in dnaAochre or <U+0394>oriC cells (which replicate the chromosome from oriN) growing in different media. As a control, an isogenic strain containing oriN and a functional chromosomal origin (DnaA+ OriC+) was analysed. The results show that this control strain (which contains oriN but does not depend on it) had the strong, positive relationship between growth and the ori/ter ratio characteristic of B. subtilis (Supplementary Fig. S9, top Table and panel) whereas oriN-dependent cells had a much weaker positive relationship (Supplementary Fig. S9, bottom Table and panel). This weaker response is probably because the plasmid replicon (i) is relatively insensitive to differences in the richness of media and (ii) cannot support high growth rates since it is unable to provide the high frequency of DNA initiation events required in rich media.To determine which replication step is defective in CCM mutants, the growth-ori/ter ratio coupling in oriN-dependent derivatives was analysed as above. This analysis was focused on class II metabolic conditions where both the ori/ter ratio and the C period are affected at 37°C (i.e. the class II metabolic conditions affecting replication at high temperature and involving the pgmIP and enoLP mutations were not tested here, as the replication activity of the oriN replicon at high temperature is not known). Out of the nine tested metabolic conditions, four give a coupling typical of oriN-dependent cells while five exhibit a perturbed oriN-type coupling (Fig. 3 and inserted table). As reasoned above, the loss of the uncoupling phenotype in oriN-dependent CCM mutants shows that the corresponding CCM mutations affect initiation (i.e. the formation of an active DnaA/oriC complex) at the chromosomal origin in oriC-dependent strains, while the persistence of this phenotype in oriN-dependent cells shows that the CCM mutations affect DNA elongation (or in a step downstream of the formation of an active DnaA/oriC complex) in the parental oriC-dependent strains. This interpretation is strengthened by control experiments showing that the assay is not sensitive to the way initiation at the chromosomal origin is abrogated (by the dnaAochre or <U+0394>oriC mutation, Supplementary Fig. S10). Collectively, our results reveal that CCM genes are connected to the initiation (i.e. the formation of an active DnaA/oriC complex) or elongation (or an initiation step downstream of the formation of an active DnaA/oriC complex) phase of replication in a medium-dependent manner (Fig. 3). Although we investigated a limited number of class II conditions, links between CCM genes and different key replication phases were found in two out of the three tested media. This suggested that the mechanism of the growth-replication coupling in B. subtilis, which depends on a concerted modulation of the initiation frequency and elongation velocities (Fig. 1), may involve the combined effect of groups of CCM genes on the initiation and elongation phase of replication. This hypothesis is supported by the results presented below. Identification of the replication step responding to CCM mutations. The growth and ori/ter ratio of CCM–oriN-dependent strains were determined in class II metabolic conditions and compared with the corresponding coupling curve of the CCM+oriN-dependent strain (Supplementary Fig. S9).

Genetic links between CCM and replication genes in LBThe cell cycle studies of oriN-dependent cells presented above show that the genes encoding catalysts of the terminal reactions of glycolysis (gapA, pgk, pgm, eno and pykA) and of downstream reactions (pta and ackA) are important for replication initiation (i.e. the formation of an active DnaA/oriC complex) or elongation (or a step downstream of the formation of an active DnaA/oriC complex) in the LB medium as summarized Fig. 4A, right part of the panel. Intriguingly, a previous study carried out in the same medium showed that pgk, pgm, eno and pykA are also genetically linked to the replication genes dnaC, dnaG and dnaE, while gapA is genetically linked to dnaE29 (Fig. 4A, left part of the panel). Interestingly, the enzymes encoded by these replication genes (the helicase DnaC, the primase DnaG and the lagging strand polymerase DnaE) were recently shown to be required for the initiation and elongation phase of replication.30,31,65–69 Indeed, during initiation of DNA replication, the conserved replication initiator DnaA protein, aided by the initiation factors DnaB, DnaD and DnaI (a helicase loader), melts the origin, oriC, to mediate anti-parallel loading of two hexameric rings of the DnaC helicase, one on each melted strand.70 The primase, DnaG, and the lagging strand polymerase, DnaE, are then recruited to synthesize RNA primers and start DNA polymerization.30,31 The remaining replisomal components, including the clamp, DnaN, the clamp loader and the polymerase PolC, are then assembled to form two fully fledged replisomes with two different DNA polymerases (DnaE and PolC) that move away from oriC in opposite directions and replicate in a concerted manner the leading and lagging strands up to the terminus where the two replication forks merge.68,69Suppression of dnaE(Ts) mutations in the <U+0394>ackA context.

White arrows: anucleated minicells.To extend to ackA our search for genetic links between CCM and replication genes in LB, we used the same method as previously (note that this method did not detect genetic links between pta and replication genes29). For this, we first constructed a series of <U+0394>ackA strains containing a thermosensitive (Ts) mutation in replication genes. The double mutants were then tested for their viability (by plating) and ability to prevent filament formation (by microscopy) at restrictive temperature. Our results show that the ackA deletion restores viability and prevents filament formation at high temperature in every dnaE(ts) mutant tested (4/4) but failed to suppress thermosensitive mutations affecting other replication enzymes (namely: DnaB, DnaD, DnaC, DnaG, PolC, and DnaN) (Fig. 4B and Supplementary Table S6). Taken together, our results suggest that pgk, pykA (and possibly pgm and eno) are important for initiation (from the formation of the DnaA/oriC complex up to the recruitment of DnaC, DnaG and DnaE and the loading of two fully fledged replisomes) via an effect on DnaC, DnaG and DnaE while gapA and ackA are important for elongation via an effect on the lagging strand polymerase DnaE (Fig. 4A). This latter hypothesis is enforced by data showing that the deletion of gapA or ackA suppresses dnaE(ts) mutants mainly affected in DNA elongation.314. DiscussionWe report here on a rather large study aimed at better understanding the important and likely universal relationship between central carbon metabolism (CCM) and DNA replication. To achieve this, we characterized the cell cycle parameters in three rich media of a collection of 25 CCM B. subtilis mutants. The results reveal defects in the initiation and/or elongation phase of replication in about one-third of the metabolic conditions tested. These defects are rather strong, causing a significant increase in the concentration of the origin sequences per cell and an up to 2-fold decrease in the mean velocity of replication forks. We infer from these results that CCM is important for replication and, in particular, for the coupling between growth and replication that positions the replication cycle within the cell cycle. These roles for CCM in replication are even more surprising as the replication phenotypes reported here were found in cells that are fully proficient in replication enzymes and replication control functions.Overall, 11 genes mapping in different CCM pathways (the pentose–phosphate, glycolysis/neoglucogenesis, TCA and overflow pathways) appear to be important for replication in rich media (Fig. 2). Interestingly, their commitment in replication is medium dependent, forming partly overlapping subgroups with some genes only being needed for a single medium and others being needed for two or three media (Fig. 2). Moreover, some CCM genes are important for initiation while others are important for elongation or for both replication steps (pgk) (Fig. 3). Taken together, our results suggest that cells evolved a toolbox of intermingled CCM-replication links that it partially activates to cope with requirements imposed by the environment.The results reported here show that the coupling between growth and replication in wild-type cells depends both on the modulation of the frequency of initiation and the mean velocity of replication forks (Fig. 1). Studies on CCM mutants confirm this conclusion (Figs 3 and 4) and suggest that this coupling may depend on both CCM-initiation and CCM-elongation links. It is thus tempting to speculate that these links are part of the metabolic control of DNA replication in B. subtilis.Additional results presented here and in a previously publication uncover strong genetic links between six CCM genes (gapA, pgk, pgm, eno, pykA and ackA) and three replication genes (dnaC, dnaG and dnaE) in cells growing in the rich LB medium (Fig. 4A).29 These links allow CCM mutations to restore the viability of thermosensitive replication mutants at restrictive temperatures. Interestingly, the links were suggested to depend on metabolic-induced conformational changes that restore the activity of the thermosensitive replication enzymes at restrictive temperature. They however may not dependent on a (i) deep change in the replication machinery that make thermosensitive replication enzymes dispensable for replication, (ii) the overexpression of dna(Ts) genes, (iii) a decay in the degradation of the thermosensitive replication protein, (iv) a reduction in ATP concentration or (v) an induction of a stress response.29 Moreover, the replication enzymes responding to CCM alteration encode the helicase DnaC, the primase DnaG and the lagging strand polymerase DnaE that are loaded early at oriC during the initiation of replication and form a ternary complex in the replisome for carrying out DNA melting, RNA priming and essential polymerase functions in lagging strand synthesis.30,31 Although the suppression assay and the CCM-replication studies are based on distinct approaches and concepts, their combination gives us for the first time a coherent picture on how cell’s metabolism and DNA replication may be coupled in LB. Indeed, results showed that at least two metabolic genes important for initiation (pgk and pykA) are genetically linked to dnaC, dnaG and dnaE while CCM genes important for elongation (gapA and ackA) are genetically linked to dnaE (Fig. 4). This suggests that, in the LB medium, CCM may modulate initiation by altering the functional recruitment of DnaC, DnaG and DnaE to oriC and may modulate DNA elongation by altering the activity of the polymerase DnaE in replication forks. This latter hypothesis is consistent with data showing that fork progression depends on lagging strand operations71–74 and that the rate of DNA melting by helicases depends on the speed of DNA polymerases.75–77 Along this line, the physical interaction between the helicase DnaC and the polymerase DnaE30 may provide a direct means for adapting the rate of duplex unwinding and the concurrent synthesis of the leading and lagging strand to the activity of the DnaE polymerase.How might CCM impact DNA replication? Long-standing hypotheses that the overall process of regulating replication depends on the concentration of the active form of the replication initiator (DnaA–ATP), on the sub-saturation of the replication machinery in precursors and/or on the concentration of (p)ppGpp have been challenged.12–14 The results presented here also argue against the sub-saturation hypothesis, as there is no obvious correlation between the impact (positive or negative) of CCM mutations on replication precursor pathways (the main source of (d)NTPs and ATP are the pentose phosphate pathways and the TCA cycle, respectively) and their coupling or uncoupling phenotype (Fig. 2). Post-translational modification of replication enzymes is an alternative mechanism for the metabolism-replication coupling system as such modifications are important parts of the eukaryotic arsenal for regulating DNA replication.78,79 Moreover, several lines of experimental evidence indicate that this level of regulation may also exist in bacteria. First, recent advances in proteomic technologies have uncovered post-translational modifications of numerous bacterial proteins including replication enzymes.80–83 Second, independent studies show that the E. coli replication initiator DnaA is acetylated and its level of acetylation may play a critical role in regulating DNA replication initiation,84 and that phosphorylation of the single-stranded DNA-binding (SSB) protein is important for replication in B. subtilis.85,86 Third, indirect data suggest that the CCM-replication links detected in B. subtilis and S. cerevisiae depend on a metabolism-dependent allosteric regulation of replication enzymes.29,35Post-translational modifications of replication enzymes are carried out by protein kinases/phosphatases and protein acetyltransferases/deacetylases in eukaryote cells. Such enzymes are thus potential effectors of the coupling between CCM and replication, although little is known on how their activity is regulated by metabolism (see however Ref. 87). An alternative way to achieve metabolism-dependent, allosteric-regulation of replication enzymes is via CCM itself. This group of catabolite reactions is central to the supply of precursors and energy from nutrients and to the demand in biosynthetic reactions, moreover, its activity responds almost immediately to changes in carbon sources. CCM is thus at a strategic position to dynamically integrate metabolism with replication. This dynamic integration may involve underexplored activities/functions of CCM metabolites and proteins. Indeed, several CCM metabolites have emerged as important modulators of various cellular activities by modulating dynamically protein activities via post-translational modifications or allosteric binding (see as reviews).88,89 Key metabolites among others are acetyl-coenzyme A and ATP, which are the major donors of acetyl and phosphoryl groups, respectively, and acetyl phosphate which lies at the crossroads between protein phosphorylation and protein acetylation.90–93 In addition, CCM enzymes from bacteria to eukarya are often multi-functional proteins carrying out both catalysis of a canonical metabolic reaction and non-metabolic functions involved in processes as diverse as DNA replication, transcription, cell division, signalling, apoptosis and pathogenicity. These moonlighting activities, found in the cytoplasm and the nucleus, involve novel enzymatic activities (like protein kinase activity) and/or interactions with non-metabolic enzymes (see for instance Refs. 94–97). We are currently exploring the fascinating possibility that the CCM-replication links in B. subtilis involve moonlighting activities of CCM enzymes and/or signalling metabolites.DNA double-stranded breaks are chromosomal lesions with a high mutagenic potential.98,99 Their frequency increases in response to replication control defects and the importance of this threat is highlighted by the presence of multiple mechanisms ensuring faithful genome duplication once per cell cycle, and preventing re-initiation of replication.100,101 In cells with aberrant timing of initiation, re-initiation of replication may increase the risk of double-stranded breaks by collision between forks or by forks encountering gaps in the DNA template. Such a risk may also increase in cells with a lengthened C period in consequence of a higher probability of fork breakage over time. Through their effect on replication and the timing of DNA synthesis in the cell cycle, the CCM-replication links described in this study may thus form a new determinant of genetic stability. In support of this hypothesis, it was found in E. coli that CCM mutations influence the fidelity of DNA replication102 and that mutants of the ackA-pta overflow pathway, which is genetically connected to the replication initiator DnaA,32,33 accumulate double strand breaks.103 Moreover, mutants of the budding yeast impeded in the temporal control of DNA replication may exhibit substantial increases in the spontaneous mutation rate.104 Further investigations are required to better evaluate the mechanism of CCM-replication links and its role in genetic stability and potentially in cancer as early events engaging normal human cells into the path in tumorigenesis involve major changes in CCM activity (the Warburg effect) and genetic instability.105–107We thank S.

IntroductionOysters of the family Ostreidae are a group of bivalve molluscs that include over 70 extant members considered to be keystone species widely distributed in estuarine ecosystems, performing important roles in mitigating turbidity and improving water quality.1,2 Edible oysters have established commercial significance in fisheries and aquaculture industries being among the most highly produced mollusc species in the world.3 Having evolved an extraordinary resilience to the harsh conditions of intertidal marine environments, oysters are capable of tolerating wild fluctuations in temperature and salinity, extended emersion and the persistent exposure to microbes encountered by filter-feeding.4 A rich and diverse set of immune and stress response genes in the oyster genome are thought to be pivotal to the remarkably effective host defence system that enables these animals to thrive in estuaries and coastal oceans worldwide.4,5 Despite these adaptations, oyster populations both wild and captive are threatened with mass mortalities caused by epizootic infections6 and by factors associated with environmental change.1 Understanding and ameliorating susceptibility to these threats is essential for the establishment of secure mariculture and effective conservation.The Sydney Rock Oyster (Saccostrea glomerata) is an economically important species of edible oyster in Australia, naturally populating the shorelines of its eastern coast and extending across the Tasman Sea to the northern regions of New Zealand. Its cultivation contributes substantially to an aquaculture industry in Australia dating back to the 19th century, supported by selective breeding programmes that have been operating for over 25 years.1,7 The Sydney Rock Oyster, in contrast to the more widely distributed and invasive Pacific oyster (Crassostrea gigas), grows ~60% slower under favourable conditions, yet has a higher tolerance to abiotic stress, surviving up to three times longer out of water.8 It also appears to be resistant to the devastating viral disease Pacific Oyster Mortality Syndrome caused by OsHV-1.9 These characteristics provoke inquiry into the nature of the higher resilience observed in S. glomerata and offer a unique opportunity for comparative studies given the recent availability of the Pacific oyster genome. A lack of sequenced genomes from closely related species of lophotrochozoa have limited the extent of comparative studies within this highly diverse superphylum of species. Decoding a complete Saccostrea genome enables a deeper understanding of the biology and evolution of the Ostreidae and will serve as a valuable resource for genetic improvement within the oyster farming industry. Here, we present an annotated draft genome for S. glomerata and explore comparisons between genes relevant to resilience among a close relative and other more evolutionarily distant molluscs.2. Materials and methods2.1. Generation of sequence dataMantle and gill tissues were dissected from a single female oyster for high molecular weight DNA extraction and library preparation. PCR-free short-insert libraries of 210 and 450 bp along with mate-pair libraries of 3, 6 and 9 kb were sequenced on the illumina HiSeq 2500 (Supplementary Table S1). A Chicago library was produced from an additional oyster and sequenced on the illumina platform.2.2. Sequence assemblyRaw reads were quality filtered and trimmed using either Trimmomatic10 or Skewer11 to produce over 200 Gb of clean data (Supplementary Table S2). Clean reads were assembled and initially scaffolded de novo using Meraculous2.12 For detailed information see Supplementary data. Construction of a primary haploid assembly was performed using HaploMerger213 and further scaffolding performed by Dovetail Genomics (Santa Cruz, CA, USA).14 Read mapping of genomic reads was performed using Bowtie2.15 Rate of heterozygosity was estimated using the SAMtools/BCFtools16 (mpileup) pipeline to call SNPs and short InDels. Estimates of completeness were undertaken using both the CEGMA17 pipeline and BUSCO18 searches of the OrthoDB metazoan library.2.3. Genome annotationAutomated gene annotation was performed using MAKER219 (see Supplementary data). Repetitive sequences were soft-masked with RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org/RMDownload.html (13 September 2018, date last accessed)) using the RepBase20 library and a custom repeat library generated with RepeatModeler (http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler/ (13 September 2018, date last accessed)). Protein-coding sequences from the genomes of C. gigas, Pinctada fucata, Lottia gigantea, Octopus bimaculoides, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens were used for homology-based gene prediction. Stranded RNA-Seq data were aligned to the genome for use with the BRAKER121 pipeline for training an AUGUSTUS22 model that was included with a stranded transcriptome assembly produced by Ertl et al.,23 CEGMA17 derived proteins and the features of the RNA-Seq alignment in the MAKER2 pipeline. Predictions were filtered from the final gene set if they displayed no alignment to either the protein-coding genes from other species using BLAST (E-value <10-10) or to the Pfam24 database. 2.4. Phylogenetic analysisAmino acid sequences of 1,205 genes were concatenated to create a super gene (see Supplementary data). The concatenated sequences from 13 species were aligned using MUSCLE25 by selecting default settings. After removing alignment gaps from all sequences 247,779 amino acids were available for further analysis. This multiple sequence alignment was used to infer the phylogenetic relationship between the species and the maximum likelihood based RAxML26 was used for this purpose. A <U+03B3> distribution was used to model the rate variation among sites and four rate categories were chosen. To model substitutions between amino acids we opted the LG (Le and Gascuel) substitution matrix27 and used the empirical amino acid frequencies. The species Nematostella vectensis was set as the outgroup. A bootstrap resampling procedure with 100 pseudo-replicates was used to obtain statistical confidence for each bifurcation (node) of the phylogenetic tree. The software FigTree (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/ (13 September 2018, date last accessed)) was used to view and print the tree generated by RAxML.2.5. Divergence time estimationIn order to estimate the divergence times between molluscan species a Bayesian statistics based MCMCtree28 method was employed. The amino acid sequence alignment was used for this analysis and the maximum likelihood tree obtained from the RAxML program was used as the guide tree. The following fossil ages were used to calibrate the tree: 306–581 million years (MY) for the spilt between Capitella teleta and Helobdella robusta29 470–532 MY for Aplysia californica–L. gigantea divergence,29 532–549 MY for the first appearance of the molluscs30 and 550–636 MY for the first appearance of the Lophotrochozoa and Eumetazoa.30 We also fixed a maximum age of 650 MY for the root of the tree (root age). To obtain the Hessian matrix for the protein data, the codeml program of the software PAML31 was used. Using the WAG+Gamma32 model of amino acid substitution matrix and the four calibration times listed above the divergence times were estimated. The results of MCMCtree were checked for convergence using the program Tracer (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tracer/ (13 September 2018, date last accessed)) and the time-tree generated by this program was viewed using FigTree. The divergence times for each bifurcating node are given in Fig. 1a. Divergence time and rate of non-synonymous substitutions between bivalves.

The relative divergences with respect to the outgroup reveal the differences in the rate of protein evolution among bivalves.2.6. Rate of protein evolution and gene expressionTo examine the correlation between gene expression and rate of protein evolution we used 11,388 orthologous genes for the Sydney Rock-Pacific Oyster comparison. Using the codeml module of software program PAML31 we obtained the likelihood based pairwise non-synonymous divergence for each gene. We then obtained the expression levels of each gene in five tissues (gill, mantle, muscle, haemolymph and digestive system). Our analysis revealed a highly significant negative correlation (P < 0.0001) between expression level and rate of protein evolution (Supplementary Fig. S7a). We also sorted protein-coding genes based on their expression levels and grouped them into 12 categories containing equal number (949) of genes. The average estimates of gene expression levels and rate of protein evolution were computed for genes belonging to each category (Supplementary Fig. S7b). The relationship based on the mean estimates was also highly significant (P < 0.0001). To examine the rate of protein evolution across bivalves we used 3,269 orthologous genes from the 6 bivalves and L. gigantea, which was used as the outgroup. Using the codeml module of software program PAML31 we obtained the likelihood based pairwise non-synonymous divergence between L. gigantea and bivalve genomes. Since the time of divergence between L. gigantea and each bivalve is expected to be the same, any difference in the pairwise divergence suggest the variation in the rate of evolution between different bivalves (Fig. 1b). 2.7. Gene family analysisProtein sequences from S. glomerata, C. gigas, P. fucata and Patinopecten yessoensis were compared for orthology using all-against-all BLASTP alignment (E-value of 10-5) and clustered using OrthoMCL33 (inflation value of 1.5). Protein family domain analysis was performed with Hidden Markov Model (HMM) searches of the Pfam24 database (see Supplementary data). Phylogenetic trees were generated using full length protein sequences aligned with MUSCLE25 and constructed with FastTree34 using the Jones–Taylor–Thornton model then visualized with FigTree v1.4.3 and MEGA 7.35 Functional annotation of the protein-coding genes from the S. glomerata genome was undertaken using BLASTp 2.5.0+ (E-value 10-5) to search for homologs with a local copy of the NCBI non-redundant database (nr). Protein-coding sequences were aligned against the NCBI KOG database (version 28 March 2017) using RPSBLAST v2.2.15 performed via the WebMGA36 server and for analysis of biological pathways present within the S. glomerata genome, KEGG orthologous gene information was obtained using the KEGG Automatic Annotation Server (KAAS)37 using a bi-directional best hit approach with the eukaryote representative gene set as reference. 2.8. Quantifying gene expressionPaired-end transcriptome libraries from gill, mantle, male gonad, female gonad, muscle, haemolymph and digestive system used in this study were generated previously.7,23 Expression levels were measured by aligning quality processed RNA-Seq reads to the genome assembly using HiSat.38 Mapped reads were sorted with SAMtools39 and counts reported as transcripts per one million mapped reads (TPM) using StringTie.40 TPM values visualized in heatmaps were transformed to log2 (TPM + 1) and normalized across tissues using the scale function in R.3. Results3.1. Genome sequencing and de novo assemblyThe genome of S. glomerata was estimated to be 784 Mb in size based on an analysis of k-mer frequency distribution. It was sequenced to over 300-fold coverage based on this estimate by a whole-genome shotgun approach using the illumina HiSeq platform (Supplementary Table S1). Over 200 Gb of quality filtered short-insert and mate-pair read data (Supplementary Table S2) was initially assembled and scaffolded in accordance with the strategy outlined in Supplementary Fig. S1. Further contiguity improvements were made by Chicago library sequencing, HiRise scaffolding and gap filling (Supplementary data). The final S. glomerata draft assembly included 788 Mb in 10,107 scaffolds with a scaffold N50 of 804.2 kb and a contig N50 of 39.8 kb (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4).This genome is ~44% larger than that estimated for the closely related Pacific oyster C. gigas (545 Mb)5 yet smaller than the pearl oyster P. fucata (1.14 Gb).41 Many invertebrate genomes, including that of oysters, exhibit high levels of heterozygosity and repetitiveness which can complicate the assembly process. The repeat content of the draft genome was estimated to be 45.03% (Supplementary Table S5). The S. glomerata genome exhibits a relatively high level of heterozygosity based on the observation of 3.2 million SNPs and 354,373 short insertion/deletions (indels) in 703,199,470 eligible positions. This resulted in a polymorphism rate of 0.51%, comparable with the inbred sequenced C. gigas (0.73%)5 though, in contrast with the octopus, O. bimaculoides (0.08%).42 Almost 82% complete and 96% partial matches to the 248 core eukaryotic gene set could be identified in the draft assembly using the CEGMA pipeline (Supplementary Table S6), which is comparable with other invertebrate genome assemblies reported previously.43 Using the BUSCO tool we could detect a total of 787 (93.3%) of the 843 genes in the metazoan library with 672 (79%) of these being complete matches. Over 91% of the clean short-insert read data could be aligned to the draft assembly. Half the assembly was contained in the longest 241 scaffolds ranging from 0.8 to 7.1 Mb. Over 90% of the assembled bases were covered by the longest 1,321 (13%) scaffolds. The assembly metrics of the S. glomerata genome are comparable to those of other published mollusc genomes5,42,44,45 and together with completeness measures, indicate the production of a comprehensive draft.3.2. Genome annotation and comparative analysisA total of 29,738 protein-coding genes from the S. glomerata genome were annotated using homology-based and ab initio predictions (Supplementary data). Almost 88% of these were supported by RNA-Seq evidence derived from six different tissues. The gene content spanned one-third of the genome with a mean gene length of 8,737 bp averaging 8 exons per transcript (Supplementary Table S7). The number of gene predictions presented here is similar to that reported for the two published oysters C. gigas (28,027) and P. fucata (29,353).5,44 Comparing BUSCO search results with the gene models from C. gigas and P. fucata show that the predictions from this study have the greatest number of complete (87.2%) and least number if missing genes (5.6%) of the three, indicating this study has produced the most complete gene model set for an oyster species reported to date (Supplementary Table S8).Phylogenetic analysis using 1,205 conserved orthologues with 247,779 amino acid positions from 16 metazoan species show that Saccostrea diverged from Crassostrea ~77 million years ago (Ma) (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S6). The time estimates obtained for the other nodes of the tree was comparable to those of other previous studies.5,46,47Saccostrea glomerata has the slowest non-synonymous substitution rate in protein sequences of the six bivalve assemblies reported to date, suggestive of a slowly evolving genome, a rate slightly lower than the scallop (Fig. 1b). The rate of protein evolution has a particularly strong negative correlation with the level of gene expression indicating strong selection pressures in genes expressed highly across the genome (Supplementary Fig. S7).Comparison of orthologous gene groups shared among bivalves S. glomerata, C. gigas, P. fucata and the scallop P. yessoensis show a core set of 8,838 gene groups and unique set of 1,111 that are Saccostrea-specific. Saccostrea glomerata shares 13,106 gene groups with the most closely related C. gigas yet has a larger number of unique genes (Fig. 2a and b). Gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis of the gene groups unique to Saccostrea reveal an overrepresentation of GO terms associated largely with binding and metabolism (Supplementary Table S9).

Gene family expansionTo better understand the genome-wide similarities among molluscs, we examined the distribution of 8,629 Pfam domains across a diverse set of 26 metazoan genomes identifying a number of significant gene family expansions in Saccostrea. These include toll-like receptors (TLRs); PF01582, immunoglobulin domain-containing genes; PF00047, thrombospondins; PF00090, complement (C1q) subunits; PF00386, G-protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs); PF00002 and heat-shock proteins; PF00012, many of which are not found expanded in Crassostrea (Fig. 2c). A group of 42 gene families were determined to be significantly expanded in the S. glomerata genome and not so in any of the other molluscs examined. Almost a third (13) of these appear uniquely in Saccostrea, that is to say, not considered expanded in any of the other 25 species included in this analysis (Supplementary Table S10). Of these gene family expansions, some of the most notable have occurred in gene families associated with non-self-recognition and other components of the immune response. Expansions of some immune-related gene families has been described previously in studies of Crassostrea and other bivalves, and has been attributed to a pathogen-rich and dynamic intertidal habitat.5,48 However, several protein families in Saccostrea greatly exceed the domain counts found in the other oysters. Saccostrea glomerata also retain a considerable inventory of some of the important and well-studied immune-related gene families compared with other lophotrochozoans (Table 1), even though these families do not appear expanded when compared with the metazoan genomes used in this study.

This level of expansion has extended to other families of non-self-recognition proteins, such as C-type lectins and fibrinogen-related proteins (FREPs). The diversification of TLRs is thought to be important for the recognition of Pathogen Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs) and the subsequent activation of an immunological response via MYD88 signalling.50,51 The expansions of TLRs indicate a highly specialized recognition and signalling system in Saccostrea. The abundant expression in the male gonad implies a number of these genes may have a role in reproduction (Fig. 3c). TLRs have various functions in addition to immunity in other invertebrates52 and mammalian studies have suggested a role for TLRs in spermatogenesis53 and the protection of spermatozoa.54 The clear tissue specificity of groups of TIR domains in S. glomerata may reflect distinctions or possible interactions between reproductive and immune processes.

This number is triple that of C. gigas (192) and P. fucata (163) and over 100 more than B. floridae which has the highest compliment of FREPs (395) of any other species included in the comparison (Fig. 4a). The S. glomerata genes containing fibrinogen_C domains vary considerably in their length, composition and domain arrangement and the majority appear to be indiscriminately distributed across the genome apart from a few main clusters, the largest being a set of 17 genes arranged in the same orientation ranging over 478 kb on a single scaffold (Fig. 4b). The majority of FREPs were not found to be expressed among the 7 tissue types used in this study; however, the expression profile of the 262 FREPs that were detected suggests these genes are distinctly tissue-specific, occurring to a lesser extent within the haemolymph (Fig. 4c). The broadest expression of FREPs can be seen in gill tissue, likely due to the increased exposure of this organ to exogenous microbes. Also observed is an expansion of C-type lectin domain-containing genes that are similarly important for non-self-recognition and display comparable tissue-specific patterns of expression (Supplementary Fig. S9).

Phenoloxidase has been shown to be important in disease resistance in S. glomerata59 and laccases and have been shown to have antibacterial activity in C. gigas.60 Phylogenetic analysis of genes in S. glomerata that contain at least three multicopper oxidase domains form two clusters and are expressed most highly in the digestive system and mantle and with a pattern suggestive of tissue-specific functionality (Supplementary Fig. S10).In addition to the expansion of immune-related gene families, oysters have stress response adaptations that enable them to persist in challenging environments. Comparisons of anti-apoptosis and stress-related genes reveal a broadening of these gene families in S. glomerata compared with C. gigas (Fig. 5). A similar pattern is shared between the mussel B. platifrons which endures the stress associated with deep sea vents and the shallow-water mussel M. philippinarum.46 Expansion of these gene families appears to be a critical response for building resilience in these more stress-adapted species.

The S. glomerata genome encodes 80 IAP genes, almost half of which form two clusters, based on phylogenetic analysis, suggesting a recent expansion (Supplementary Fig. S8a). The expression of these 80 IAPs in 7 oyster tissues appears tissue-specific, suggesting the possibility of functional specializations (Supplementary Fig. S8b). Although, the phylogenetic relationships of these IAPs do not appear to accord with tissue-specific patterns of expression. Expansions of genes containing the IAP repeat were found only within the 6 bivalves included in this study. The enrichment of IAP genes unique to the bivalve lineage is likely a fundamental component of their extraordinary survivability.3.4. Analysis of molluscan genes associated with reproductionReproductive activities of all eumetazoans are controlled by the neuroendocrine system.63 In vertebrates, this includes a hypothalamic–pituitary–gonadal (HPG) axis. Several homologs of the HPG axis, such as gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) and glycoprotein hormones,64 have been identified among invertebrates. However, the molecular components of reproductive regulation in invertebrates are still largely unresolved and can be variable across phyla.65 We found 40 genes in the S. glomerata genome that have previous been linked to invertebrate reproductive processes. A similar distribution was observed for these genes among six other molluscan genomes (Fig. 6). The majority of non-neuropeptide genes associated with reproduction were highly expressed in the gonads, both testis and ovary. However, abundant expression of some of these genes within non-reproductive tissues (haemolymph, gill, mantle, muscle and digestive gland) indicates they may fulfil additional roles. For example, the high abundance of NPY and GPR54-2 within the digestive gland suggests a functional association of these two proteins in the physiological regulation of digestive system and feeding. Putative receptors for GnRH/corazonin, tachykinin and NPY, and a homologue of vertebrate GPR54, which is a receptor for a vertebrate reproductive neuropeptide ‘kisspeptin’,66 were abundant in the gonad tissues. This provides strong evidence for a role of these receptors, with their cognate ligands, in Saccostrea reproduction. Genes associated with reproduction and their distribution in 6 molluscs and their expression in S. glomerata. Genes that were more abundant in the testis compared with ovary includes the putative receptor genes (5HTR1, TACRs, GnRHR/CrzR, and NPYR) and testis-specific protein genes (TSSKs). Conversely, expression of genes encoding reproductive signalling factors, such as CDA-A, ß-catenin, Phb2, nanos, FoxL2 and vitellogenin, were higher in ovary tissue. Neuropeptides, including CCAP, buccalin, APGWamide and ELH, were found at relative low abundance in the gonads, but higher in the gill and mantle tissues. In the muscle and digestive tissues, there was overall low expression of all reproductive-related genes, except for NPY and GPR54-2, which were highly expressed and potentially specific to the digestive gland.

DiscussionThis study presents the sequenced and assembled genome of the Sydney Rock Oyster, S. glomerata, an important species for Australian aquaculture and a focus of conservation due to the severe decline in shellfish reef habitats. The S. glomerata genome is the second reference genome to be reported from the family Ostreidae (edible oysters), enabling for the first time whole-genome comparative studies between ostreid species. This resource can improve our understanding of the mechanisms these organisms have evolved for survival in the highly stressful intertidal environment, facilitating selective breeding and the enhancement of oyster cultivation practices. The draft assembly achieved comparably high levels of completeness and contiguity with respect to other published mollusc genomes. The statistics for scaffold and contig N50 improved upon the two other oyster genomes previously reported due largely to technological advances in sequencing. The use of 250 bp read lengths and ‘Chicago’ libraries contributed heavily to the production of a highly contiguous assembly, offering a more affordable alternative to BAC or fosmid sequencing.The larger genome size of S. glomerata did not appear to contain a proportionately higher number of protein-coding genes, nor larger average exon or intron sizes. However, 354 Mb of repetitive sequences (45% of the genome) were identified compared with only 202 Mb (36% of the genome) found in C. gigas.5 An expansion of nuclease and transposase domains such as PF01498 (15 out of 89 total genes across 23 species) in S. glomerata, suggests that this may be the result of increased transposable element activity, adding further support to a role for these mobile sequences in shaping genome variation.5The types of gene families found expanded in the S. glomerata genome are not dissimilar to those in the other bivalve genomes. In fact, there is a noteworthy collection of genes associated with stress and immune defence in the genome of C. gigas that are thought to have expanded in response to the environmental variability and the exposures of filter-feeding confronted by the oyster.44 It appears that these features of the oyster genome are not unique to C. gigas, despite its invasive capacity, and are rather a characteristic of oysters more generally and their adaptation to a sessile existence in harsh environments. However, some of the immune-associated gene families are present up to 3-fold higher in Saccostrea than in the other published molluscs and are more abundant than in any of the other 26 species investigated here, suggesting an evolutionary history of extensive selective pressure from invading microbes. Given the relative short divergence time from Crassostrea and a slower rate of protein evolution yet a distinctly larger, more repetitive genome, it may be that the mechanisms for gene duplications are intrinsically more active in Saccostrea and are, at least in part, contributing to a phenotype of higher environmental resilience.Genes associated with molecular pattern recognition are collectively the most significantly expanded in the S. glomerata genome. Large expansions of FREPs have been extensively studied in the snail Biomphalaria and are speculated to be due to lineage-specific selective pressure from trematode parasites like Schistosoma mansoni.48,67 Protozoan parasites, among other microbes, are major threats for a variety of bivalve species.68 Commercial production of S. glomerata has been severely impacted by mortalities arising from infection with the protozoan pathogens, such as Marteilia sydneyi causing QX disease, which infect S. glomerata exclusively.69,70 The substantial expansion of FREPs in Saccostrea may be due to increased selective pressure from persistent challenge by disease-causing microbes and a need for broad recognition capacity. Clustering of these genes within the genome offers some evidence of local tandem duplications and the clear pattern of tissue-specific expression indicates these genes may have evolved to perform specialized functions. Interestingly, the expression of FREPs appears somewhat concentrated in the gill tissue that coincides with the site of infection for M. sydneyi and other important pathogens.59,71In Australia, wild populations of S. glomerata have been under pressure from the introduction of the faster growing C. gigas, which can rapidly overgrow and displace the native oyster at the low to mid-intertidal zones.72 At higher intertidal areas, however, S. glomerata is able to survive due to its greater tolerance to thermal stress and emersion.8 A highly developed anti-apoptosis system is thought to be important for the endurance of oysters to abiotic stress ascribed to the expansion of IAP genes and the propensity of air exposure to induce the dramatic upregulation of IAPs in C. gigas.5,62 The expansion of anti-apoptosis and stress response genes in the S. glomerata genome appears essential to the resilience observed in this species.The draft S. glomerata genome presented here provides a valuable resource for further studies in molluscan biology and would accelerate genetic enhancement programs for commercially produced oyster species.We gratefully acknowledge the University of the Sunshine Coast for a Post-Graduate Research Scholarship to D.P. and Genecology, the Centre for Genetics, Ecology and Physiology for financial support.
