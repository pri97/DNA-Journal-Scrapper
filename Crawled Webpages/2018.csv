IntroductionGummy stem blight (Gsb) is a destructive disease caused by the ascomycetous fungus Didymella bryoniae (Auersw.) Rehm, which can infect many cucurbit species.1 Because of the agricultural importance of this disease, cucurbit sources of genetic resistance were selected several decades ago.2 Gsb of melon has increased in importance because it is responsible for considerable economic losses, especially in humid tropical and sub-tropical regions. Many Gsb-resistant melon varieties have been identified, and genetic analyses revealed several independent Gsb-resistance loci, including five monogenic dominant resistance loci (Gsb-1, Gsb-2, Gsb-3, Gsb-4, and Gsb-6) and one monogenic recessive resistance locus (gsb-5) from six resistant PIs (PI140471, PI157082, PI511890, PI482398, PI420145, and PI482399), respectively.3,4 Different molecular markers linked to Gsb resistance have been used for marker-assisted selection of Gsb-resistant germplasms.5 However, a functional Gsb-resistance gene has not been identified.Several genetic linkage maps from different populations have been constructed based on relatively few molecular markers, which were used to map quantitative trait loci (QTLs) for agronomic and disease-resistance traits in melon.6–9 After the whole melon (Cucumis melo) genome sequence was published,10 those available simple sequence repeat and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were integrated to build preferably genetic maps useful for anchoring contigs/scaffolds or locating QTLs.11 High-throughput re-sequencing has been proposed as a viable option for detecting markers, genotyping and constructing genetic maps.12 It has been used to construct ultra-dense genetic maps based on the availability of advanced recombinant inbred lines or an F2 population.13–16 Many important QTLs or genes have been identified using mapping-by-sequencing methods, which have accelerated forward-genetics research even in non-model species.17,18During the co-evolution of plants and microbes, host-adapted pathogens evolved effectors to suppress pathogen-associated molecular patterns-triggered immunity (PTI), which is the first basal defence against infections by non-adapted pathogens. Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) conferred by plant resistance (R) genes contributes to a highly effective defence system, which is deployed by plants as a second, largely intracellular, layer of immunity.19–22 A coordinated relay of information between the cytoplasm and nucleus by intracellular signalling systems is required for both PTI and ETI to ensure defence-related transcripts are transferred from nucleus to the cytoplasmic protein synthesis machinery.In this study, we constructed an ultra-dense genetic map with 12,932 recombination bin markers comprising 1,188,159 SNPs. This map may be useful for updating the melon genome and for mapping C. melo genes. For example, we mapped a 108-kb region associated with Gsb resistance on pseudo-chromosome 4. This ultra-dense genetic map may be useful for future molecular analyses of melon.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and Didymella bryoniae inoculationAn inbred line of Cucumis melo spp. conomon (var. conomon) (HS) and an inbred line of Cucumis melo spp. melo (var. inodorus) (XH) were crossed to generate F1, F2, and BC1 populations. The HS and XH lines as well as their F1, F2, and BC1 populations were used for genetic analyses. The F2 population was used to construct a genetic map and map the candidate Gsb-resistance gene.Plants were inoculated with D. bryoniae using a modified version of a published method.23 The D. bryoniae spores collected from infected melon plants were cultured on potato dextrose agar medium in Petri dishes using a mycelial plug inoculation. The Petri dishes were incubated at 25 °C in the darkness for 7 days and then under ultraviolet irradiation conditions (40 w, 12 h light/12 h dark) for 4 days. Inocula were prepared by flooding the Petri dishes with 5–10 ml acidified distilled water. The resulting solution was acidified to pH 4.0 using lactic acid, and Tween-20 was added as a surfactant (20 drops/l). The spore suspension was adjusted to 5 × 105 spores/ml using a haemocytometer, and then applied to 3- to 4-week-old plants in a foliar spray. Inoculated plants were covered by a plastic tent to maintain a relative humidity of 92%. The plastic wrap was removed 3 days later. Plants were re-inoculated to ensure there were no escapees or false-positives.2.2. Sequencing library construction and high-throughput sequencingGenomic DNAs was extracted from the leaves of the parental lines (HS and XH) and 150 individual lines from the F2 population according to the CTAB method. The genomic DNAs were sheared into ~500-bp fragments using the S2/E210 Ultrasonicator (Covaris, USA) for the subsequent paired-end (PE125) sequencing using the HiSeq2500 system (Illunima, USA).2.3. SNP identification and genotypingRaw reads were filtered to generate clean reads, which were mapped to the genome to estimate the insert sizes in the sequencing library, calculate the reads depth, and determine the distribution of reads in the melon genome (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/assembly/GCF_000313045.1/ (23 August 2017, date last accessed))10 using the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner programme.24 Duplicated reads were removed using SAMtools.25 Potential SNPs between all lines and the genome were detected using the GATK toolkit.26 The SNPs identified between the parents were considered as polymorphic for a subsequent bin calling. The F2 genotypes were identified based on the SNP positions. The ‘pileup’ function of the SAMtools programme was used to merge the SNP datasets, in which only biallelic SNPs were kept. Short reads that were matched to multiple locations in either genome, or that did not match perfectly with at least one of the parental genomes were discarded. The VCF format document was used for genotyping according to the parental SNPs, and only the aa × bb genotype was kept. The SNPs with less than 4× coverage in either parent or with fewer than 15 SNPs in a single scaffold were eliminated. Additionally, the SNPs with an extreme segregation distortion (P < 0.01) were initially excluded by the <U+03C7>2 test for a subsequent bin calling. 2.4. Bin map and linkage map constructionA modified slide window method was adopted for bin calling.13 The genotype of each window was called with a window size of 15 SNPs and a step size of 1 SNP. Windows containing more than 13 ‘aa’ or ‘bb’ types were genotyped as ‘aa’ or ‘bb’, respectively. Fifteen adjacent SNP intervals with the same genotype across the entire F2 population were combined into a recombination bin. A final set of bin markers was used to construct linkage groups (LGs) with the HighMap programme.27 Marker loci were partitioned primarily into LGs based on their locations in the C. melo genome. Next, the modified logarithm of odds (MLOD) scores between markers were calculated to verify the robustness of the markers in each LG. Markers with MLOD scores <5 were filtered prior to ordering. The error correction strategy of SMOOTH was then used according to the parental contributions to genotypes, and a k-nearest neighbour algorithm was applied to impute missing genotypes. Skewed markers were then added into the map by applying a multipoint maximum likelihood mapping. Map distances were estimated using the Kosambi mapping function. We then used the ALLMAPS programme to construct melon pseudo-chromosomes based on a comparison between the constructed genetic map and the map of the melon genome.28 Finally, we constructed pseudo-chromosomes referred to the published genome of melon.2.5. Analysis of co-linearity and recombination hotspotsThe sequences of the bin markers included in the linkage map were aligned to the physical sequences of C. lanatus (ftp://www.icugi.org/pub/genome/watermelon/97103/v1/ (23 August 2017, date last accessed)) and C. sativus (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/1639?genome_assembly_id=228904 (23 August 2017, date last accessed)) using the BLAT programme to confirm their physical positions in the genome. Spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficient was calculated to assess the co-linearity between C. melo and C. lanatus, and between C. melo and C. sativus. Recombination hotspots (RHs) were predicted based on the recombination rate of markers and the anchored C. melo genome. If the value that the genetic distance between adjacent markers was divided by a value >20 cM/Mb, the region between the two adjacent markers was considered to be an RH.292.6. Re-anchoring scaffoldsFiltered markers were mapped to genome assembly scaffolds, and the markers on scaffolds that were mapped to pseudo-chromosomes were counted. If the value of the following equation was >0.5, we kept the scaffold mapping results, otherwise, they were eliminated: [number of markers in the largest pseudo-chromosome - number of markers in the second largest pseudo-chromosome]/number of markers in the largest pseudo-chromosome. We then determined the position of each marker relative to each other. If the relative position in the scaffold was identical to the relative position in the genetic map, the scaffold was considered to be oriented in the forward direction. Additionally, if more markers were in the forward position than in the reverse position, the scaffold was considered to be facing the forward direction. Finally, we selected one clearly oriented scaffold as the initial scaffold, and iteratively anchored other scaffolds with higher scores.2.7. Mapping of candidate Gsb-resistance genesThe rQTL package was used to map the candidate Gsb-resistance genes. The IM method of the rQTL package was applied for qualitative trait mapping.30 The significance thresholds were determined using 1,000 permutations, in which the threshold value was set as 2.5. The hk algorithm was selected as the me parameter, while 1 and 3 were used as the win and cofactor parameters, respectively.2.8. RNA isolation, cDNA preparation, and quantitative real-time PCRLeaves from HS and XH plants after inoculation (0, 0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 days) were sampled and frozen in liquid nitrogen. Total RNA was isolated from leaves using mirVanaTM miRNA Isolation Kit (Ambion) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration and quality were assessed using a Thermo 2000 Bioanalyzer with an RNA NanoDrop (Thermo Scientific, USA; http://www.thermo.com (23 August 2017, date last accessed)). Samples showing A260/A230 ratio of 2.0–2.2 and A260/A280 ratio of 1.8–2.0 were used for further analysis. For quantitative real-time PCR, 1 µg of total RNA was reverse transcribed to first-strand cDNA in a final reaction volume of 20 µl using miScript II RT Kit (Qiagen). The transcriptional patterns of the candidate Gsb-resistance genes were analysed using a quantitative real-time PCR (RT-qPCR). Details regarding the primers used in this study are provided in Supplementary Table S10.2.9. Genotyping analysis of MELO03C012987 geneFull-length sequence of MELO03C012987 gene (except for stop codon) was amplified by PCR from leaves of six resistant inbred lines (HP9818, HB6, HB11, HB13, CNZ, and QDH) and five susceptible inbred lines (RM, MW, DZX, M14086, and M15019) to analyse the SNP further. The primers are listed in Supplementary Table S10. The resulting PCR products were cloned into a pEASY-Blunt Zero Cloning Vector according to the manufacturer’s instructions (TRANs, Beijing, China; www.transgen.com.cn (23 August 2017, date last accessed)) and amplified in E coil overnight. Subsequently, eight clones of each line were sequenced by ABI3730xl sequencer. Few clones with sequence that did not match perfectly with reference full length were discarded.3. Results3.1. Gsb resistance in C. melo is controlled by a single dominant geneThe HS and XH inbred lines were used to construct a genetic map and evaluate Gsb resistance (Fig. 1A). Plants growth and the development of disease symptoms in seedlings inoculated with D. bryoniae were used to assess Gsb resistance or susceptibility. Accordingly, the HS and XH inbred lines were resistant and susceptible to Gsb, respectively (Fig. 1B and Table 1). A phenotypic analysis revealed that the F1 population from the XH × HS cross was resistant to Gsb, which is suggestive of a dominant resistance trait (Fig. 1A and Table 1). A phenotypic analysis of the F2 population derived from the XH × HS reciprocal cross revealed a 1:3 segregation ratio for the F2 population and a 1:1 segregation ratio for the BC1 population, which is consistent with a monogenic resistance trait (Table 1). Inheritance of Gsb resistance in C. meloPhenotypic observations for the whole plant 21 days post-inoculation were used to determine resistance/susceptible to Gsb.Observed segregation ratios are statistically consistent with the expected ratios (<U+03C7>2 test, P < 0.05).Inheritance of Gsb resistance in C. meloPhenotypic observations for the whole plant 21 days post-inoculation were used to determine resistance/susceptible to Gsb.Observed segregation ratios are statistically consistent with the expected ratios (<U+03C7>2 test, P < 0.05).Phenotypic analysis of the two inbred lines used to construct a genetic map and for mapping the Gsb-resistance gene.

Construction of a sequence-based ultra-dense C. melo genetic mapIn total, 12.94 and 13.14 Gb clean reads were generated for the XH and HS inbred lines (26× genome coverage), respectively. Meanwhile, 217.7 Gb clean reads were generated for the 150 F2 population individuals (2× genome coverage), with more than 85% of the bases higher than Q30 (Supplementary Table S1). The well-distributed clean reads coverage on assembly scaffolds as well as the distribution of SNP mutation and SNP quality were indicative of the stochastic nature of resequencing (Supplementary Table S1 and Figs S1 and S2). The co-segregating SNPs were clustered in recombination bins (marked as Block), which were used to construct genetic linkage map. We constructed an ultra-dense genetic map consisting of 12 pseudo-chromosomes based on 12,932 recombination bin markers comprising 1,188,159 C. melo SNPs (Supplementary File S1), which covered 1,818 cM, with an average distance of 0.17 cM between adjacent bin markers (Table 2, Supplementary Table S3). Construction of an ultra-dense C. melo genetic mapConstruction of an ultra-dense C. melo genetic mapHaplotype maps and linkage relationships heat maps were used to evaluate the quality of the genetic map. Haplotype maps, which indicate genotyping errors, were generated for each of the 150 lines in the F2 population as well as the parental lines. These maps presented the recombination events (pseudo-chromosome 10 haplotype map in Supplementary Fig. S3 and all haplotype maps for the 12 pseudo-chromosomes in Supplementary File S2). Almost all the recombination blocks were completely defined, with only pseudo-chromosome 7 missing 0.01% of its data. The linkage relationships heat maps, reflected the relationship between recombination markers in one pseudo-chromosome, and were used for ordering errors. These maps were created based on pair-wise recombination values for the 12,932 bin markers (pseudo-chromosome 10 linkage relationship heat map in Supplementary Fig. S4 and all linkage relationship heat maps for the 12 pseudo-chromosomes in Supplementary File S3). The constructed pseudo-chromosomes generally performed well according to the generated the heat maps. We then compared our genetic map (HS × XH) with a published melon genetic map (PS × SC).31 Of the 580 SNPs in the PS × SC F2 genetic map, 558 were mapped to the HS × XH F2 genetic map. Most of the pseudo-chromosomes were consistent with co-linearity (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S5). We likewise compared the HS × XH F2 genetic map with the melon genetic map compiled by the International Cucurbit Genomics Initiative.6 This comparison uncovered similar co-linear relationships among pseudo-chromosomes.

Genome re-anchoringThe HS × XH F2 genetic map was used to re-anchor the genome scaffolds to the 12 pseudo-chromosomes. We obtained all assembled scaffolds from the melon reference genome.10 Based on the genetic map, we anchored 92% of the scaffolds assembly (344.9 Mb of 374.8 Mb; 153 scaffolds) onto the 12 pseudo-chromosomes (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S4). We determined the orientation of 97.75% (336 Mb) of the anchored scaffolds, and detected chimeric scaffolds, with each anchored to different pseudo-chromosomes in the genome. For example, in scaffold NW_007546289.1, 264 Blocks were mapped onto pseudo-chromosome 5, and 72 Blocks were anchored onto pseudo-chromosome 8. In addition, in scaffold NW_007546312.1, 79 Blocks were mapped to pseudo-chromosome 8, and 41 Blocks were anchored to pseudo-chromosome 11. These results indicate that this ultra-dense genetic map may be used to improve the published melon genome assembly.

Scaffolds were displayed in blue and grey lines represent corresponding genetic markers between each pseudo-chromosome and scaffolds.3.4. Analysis of RHsWe identified 1,135 RHs, which were unequally distributed to all 12 pseudo-chromosomes. pseudo-chromosome 9 had the most RHs (153), while pseudo-chromosome 10 had the fewest (30) (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S5). Most RHs were located at the telomeres of pseudo-chromosome, which suggested the pericentromeric regions lacked recombination events (Fig. 4). The fact that almost no RHs were detected on one arm of pseudo-chromosome 10, may have been because very few markers were distributed in this region (Fig. 4), or might be related to the acrocentric morphology of this chromosome.31Genetic positions of the recombination hotspots in the 12 melon pseudo-chromosome.Genetic positions of the recombination hotspots in the 12 melon pseudo-chromosome.3.5. Comparison of the Cucurbitaceae pseudo-chromosomesA comparison between our genetic map of melon and the genetic maps of other Cucurbitaceae species (i.e., watermelon and cucumber) revealed a relatively weak syntenic relationship between the genomes (Fig. 5, Supplementary Fig. S6 and Table S6). In a comparison with cucumber chromosomes, Spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficients for 12 melon pseudo-chromosomes varied from 0.63 to 0.07. Additionally, in a comparison with watermelon chromosomes, Spearman’s rank-order correlation coefficients for 12 melon pseudo-chromosomes ranged from 0.67 to 0.01 (Supplementary Table S6). Of the 12 melon pseudo-chromosomes, pseudo-chromosome 10 exhibited a closer syntenic relationship with watermelon Chr 5 and cucumber Chr 5 than the other pseudo-chromosomes (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S6). These results imply that the genomic structures of pseudo-chromosome 10 from melon, Chr 5 from watermelon and cucumber are relatively conserved.

Mapping of C. melo Gsb-resistance gene candidatesThe 12 pseudo-chromosomes as well as the genotyping and phenotyping data related to Gsb resistance were used to map the candidate Gsb-resistance gene (GsbR). We identified a 0.667-cM region on pseudo-chromosome 4 with two bin markers (Block13188 and Block13179) that satisfied the LOD threshold of 2.5, implying the region is linked to Gsb resistance. The LOD values of Block13188 and Block13179 were 2.528 and 2.737, respectively, while the contribution rates were 9.36 and 10.72, respectively (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Table S7). The additive effects and dominant effects were 0.177 and 0.12, respectively (Supplementary Table S7). Furthermore, a scaffold (CM3.5_scaffold00018) with 71 well-distributed SNPs was identified during the genotyping of the HS (Gsb resistant) and XH (Gsb susceptible) parent lines (Supplementary Table S8). Eight candidate genes were annotated in this region based on the melon reference genome, GO, NR, Swiss-Prot, COG, and KEGG databases (Fig. 6A, Table 3, and Supplementary Table S9).

(E) Genotyping of the non-synonymous substitution of MEL03C012987 in resistant and susceptible lines of C. melo.We analysed the expression patterns of these candidate genes in HS and XH plants inoculated with D. bryoniae. We were unable to detect the expression of MELO3C012988, MELO3C012989, and MELO3C012990 in control and inoculated plants, implying these genes may not directly influence Gsb-resistance. In contrast, MELO03C012987 expression was considerably upregulated in HS and XH plants inoculated with D. bryoniae (Fig. 6B). The expression levels of the remaining candidate genes (i.e., MELO3C012986, MELO3C012991, MELO3C012992, and MELO3C012993) were not induced by D. bryoniae inoculation (Fig. 6B). These results indicated that MELO03C012987 is most likely the gene responsible for Gsb-resistance in melon. A Pfam BLAST analysis indicated that MELO03C012987 includes a DUF761 domain (Fig. 6C). We then compared the mapped region between the HS and XH lines. A non-synonymous SNP was identified in the MELO03C012987 gene, which resulted in a Lysine being replaced by a glutamic acid in the encoded protein (Fig. 6D). Genotyping MELO03C012987 from six resistant and five susceptible inbred lines of C. melo revealed that all five susceptible lines (RM, MW, DZX, M14086, and M15019) exhibited Adenine at the non-synonymous SNP, which is same as that found in XH plant. Of the six resistant lines genotyped, five (HB6, HB11, HB13, CNZ, and QDH) had the Guanine at this non-synonymous substitution as that in HS plant. Whereas, HP9818 exhibited either Guanine or Adenine, representing a heterozygous genotype (Fig. 6E and Supplementary Table S11).4. DiscussionThe melon genome sequence10 and several genetic maps7,8,11,31 have recently been published. However, functional genomics studies involving melon are still restricted by the fact only a few hundred or thousand markers have been explored. Based on a F2 population of double-haploid DHL92 used for melon genome sequence,10 a genetic map was developed composing of 580 SNPs, which anchored the scaffolds into a chromosome-scale pseudomolecules.31 This work not only provided a significantly updated melon genome, but also indicated that high-resolution genetic map could be an efficient approach for the improvement of genome draft sequence. Rapid advances in high-throughput sequencing have revolutionized SNP marker discovery and genotyping analyses. Additionally, high-throughput sequencing-based approaches are now routinely used to construct genetic maps.13,15,16 An important strength of genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) is that the detection and genotyping of genome-wide SNP markers occur simultaneously. Moreover, a GBS approach does not require a reference genome for SNP calling and genotyping. However, an available reference genome is useful because it enables the proper alignment and ordering of sequenced tags and helps to impute low-coverage data.32 These two sub-species are commonly used in breeding programmes because they are resistant to multiple diseases and exhibit desirable traits regarding sugar content and flavour. After a genotyping analysis, we obtained 12,932 bin markers, which included more than one million SNPs. Using these bin markers, we constructed the first ultra-dense genetic map that can be used as a reference in future studies of melon. Recently, 354.98 Mb of melon scaffolds were anchored and 325.4 Mb of sequences were oriented by a new set of targeted SNP markers with better distribution in the parents of the DHL92 melon reference genome.31 In our study, several missed scaffolds were assembled into melon pseudo-chromosome. Furthermore, more sequence (336.05 Mb) were oriented in our new scaffold genome, suggesting that our ultra-dense genetic map could further improve the anchoring and orienting of melon scaffold genome assembly.A GBS-based high-resolution genetic map can be efficiently used to identify genetic regions and candidate genes underlying agronomically important traits.17,33,34 We mapped a 0.667 cM region on pseudo-chromosome 4, and identified eight candidate genes for Gsb resistance in this region. Thus, an ultra-dense genetic map can be constructed and candidate genes underlying Gsb resistance can be mapped using a GBS approach. Genetic map-based high-quality reference genome sequences provide useful information not only for identifying genes and regulatory elements, but also for characterizing genomic diversity.35 Our ultra-dense genetic map improved the re-anchoring of scaffolds to the reference genome. It may also contribute fundamental information for the de novo assembly of a high-quality oriental melon genome. Moreover, the improved anchoring of scaffolds may help researchers analyse chromosomal structures to improve the accuracy of gene mapping. Comparisons of genetic maps can reveal the genetic basis for conserved and variable sequences within species or among related species. We observed a strong co-linearity, but also rearrangements between our HS × XH F2 genetic map and the genetic maps of whole-genome sequenced melons, especially in pseudo-chromosomes 3–5. A chromosome-level comparison between the C. melo genetic map and the C. sativus and C. lanatus genomes revealed syntenic relationships among these three Cucurbitaceae species. The complex syntenic patterns presented as segmented chromosome-to-chromosome orthologous relationships were consistent with the notion that the chromosomal evolution and rearrangement among these three Cucurbitaceae species is very complex.10,36,37 However, it remains possible that such differences are derived from different mapping populations being used for various genotypes associated with a chromosome-level reorganization.Among the detected Gsb-resistance candidate genes, MELO3C012986 encodes a protein similar to a VHS domain-containing protein, which is involved in clathrin-related endomembrane trafficking in plants.38,MELO3C012991 encodes a Sec13, which is part of a nuclear pore complex with subunits that are involved in the responses to pathogens, cold stress, auxin, and ethylene.39 We identified an RT-like gene (i.e., encoding a reverse transcriptase) upstream of Sec13. An RT gene is usually associated with a mobile element, such as a retrotransposon, retrovirus, group II intron, retron, or retroplasmid, as well as an occasional retro (pseudo) gene.40–42,MELO3C012992 encodes a GATA zinc finger transcription factor family gene (GATA TF4-like), which has been implicated in light-responsive, circadian-regulated, and nitrate-dependent control of transcription.43,44Plants are often attacked by pathogens and have evolved a multi-layered defence system. An essential defence mechanism involves the expression of resistance (R) genes, which enables plants to detect pathogens carrying the corresponding avirulence (Avr) genes.21 The R protein-mediated pathogen recognition can be direct or indirect via the action of effectors (Avr proteins) on host targets. The R gene-based resistance is usually considered to be related to gene-for-gene resistance, which often involves a hypersensitive response (HR). MELO3C012987 encodes a protein that is similar to the uncharacterized Avr9/Cf-9 rapidly elicited (ACRE) protein 146, which is related to the gene-for-gene dominant resistance to fungal pathogens.45,46 Many ACRE genes encode putative signalling components, suggesting they are essential for early defence responses.45 Four genes (i.e., ACRE74, ACRE189, ACRE264, and ACRE276) have been confirmed as essential for both Cf-9- and Cf-4-mediated HR. Previous studies determined that ACRE74, ACRE264, and ACRE276 are critical for the Cf-9-mediated resistance to C. fulvum.47–49 Our data suggested that MELO3C012987, which encodes a protein similar to ACRE146, might be the Gsb-resistance gene in melon.In conclusion, our ultra-dense genetic map may be useful for future studies aimed at identifying the genes regulating agronomically important melon traits. Additionally, functionally characterizing MELO3C012987 may contribute to the development of new strategies to control Gsb in Cucurbitaceae species. However, gene-based disease resistance sometimes fails because of developmental and/or environmental changes. Incorporating Gsb resistance into field-grown crops will require the development of sustainable broad-spectrum disease resistance.AvailabilityThe re-sequence data can be available at NCBI under accessions SRP114921.We would like to thank Prof Fengming Song from Institute of Biotechnology, Zhejiang University, to offer the Gsb isolate.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.FundingThis study was supported by grants from the earmarked fund for Modern Agro-Industry Technology Research System of China (CARS-26-17), the Science and Technology Program of Zhejiang Province (2017C32041), and the Breeding Alliance of Rice and Major Economic Crops of Zhejiang University.Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary data"

IntroductionHigh-throughput sequencing has dramatically accelerated the pace of genomic research.1,2 While once restricted to model species in laboratory settings, genomic methods are being widely applied to non-model species in nature,3–8 rapidly illuminating the black box of the genome and giving rise to the field of ecological genomics.9–11 Reduced sequencing costs have made it feasible to study transcriptomes of co-occurring species in a community ecology context (i.e. ‘community transcriptomics’),12 as well as comparative studies of transcriptome evolution across diverse clades (i.e. ‘comparative transcriptomics’).13–16 While genomic data from model species can be informative for the biology of related organisms, not all species are the same in terms of their ecology, genetics, and morphology. For example, research on the zebrafish (Danio rerio, family Cyprinidae) can be relevant for closely related species, but cannot explain the tremendous ecological and morphological diversity in this clade, as studies of single species are insufficient for understanding dynamic interactions among species and their respective genomes in a macroevolutionary context. In order to understand the causes and consequences of those interactions, as well as the origin of ecological novelty (e.g. new genes17), we must examine genomes across species that reflect that diversity. Recent studies across a diverse suite of teleost fish lineages have focused on functionally-important genetic variation in non-model species in nature.18–22Transcriptomics of species in the wild has enormous potential to advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying molecular adaptation, evolutionary diversification, ecotoxicology, and community ecology.4,23–26 In this context, several important questions arise. For example, What are the proximate and ultimate mechanisms underlying phylogenetic, ecological, and morphological divergence? How have ancestral genomes been molded by divergent natural selection and other evolutionary forces into myriad forms that exist today? How does genomic architecture constrain or promote diversification? How important are genome duplication events in adaptive radiations? What role do genomes play in underlying the ecological dynamics of community assembly (e.g. competition, abundance, spatial and temporal dynamics, physiological constraint, etc.)? A necessary first step in addressing these questions is the generation of databases reflecting the genomic or transcriptomic variation among species, which we provide in the current study.Here we present transcriptomic resources for three members of the freshwater fish family Cyprinidae (Teleostei: Cypriniformes), one of the most speciose vertebrate clades, with over 2,000 species.27 In addition to remarkable species diversity, the clade includes extensive ecological, genetic, and morphological diversity. Cyprinid fishes (minnows and carp) comprise an important component of freshwater fish communities throughout North America, Asia, Europe and Africa.28 They are often the dominant fish taxa in numerical abundance and biomass and play an important functional role in aquatic ecosystems.29–31The ecological and taxonomic diversity of cyprinids is particularly interesting in light of the history of genome evolution in this clade. Cyprinids were part of the radiation that occurred after the teleost-specific genome duplication event, known as the ‘3R hypothesis’,32,33 that preceded and perhaps facilitated the diversification of teleost fishes.34 In addition, several cyprinid lineages have independently undergone additional rounds of genome duplications.35–38 For example, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) lineage had a fourth round of genome duplication approximately 5.6–11.339 or 8.240 million years ago (Ma), which we refer to as ‘Cc4R’. Pairs of genes arising from whole genome duplication, referred to as ‘Ohnologs’, were theoretically present for all genes immediately following the Cc4R genome duplication. Varying levels of subsequent gene-silencing and ‘re-diploidization’ have since occurred in polyploid lineages making cyprinids ideal for comparative studies of genome evolution.41,42Despite the ecological importance of cyprinids in freshwater systems worldwide and dynamic lineage-specific patterns of genomic expansions and contractions, most species have little or no genomic resources available for investigating their molecular ecology or genome evolution. Three notable exceptions are zebrafish (Danio rerio), fathead minnow (Pimephales promelas), and common carp (Cyprinus carpio). The family includes zebrafish (Danio rerio),43–45 a model species with a comprehensively-annotated genome.46 Zebrafish is an important model organism in developmental biology and disease research,43–45 due to its semitransparent embryos and ease of laboratory culture, as well as its comprehensively annotated genome.46 Fathead minnow is widely used as an indicator species in ecotoxicology studies for which microarrays have been developed47,48 and a draft genome sequence is now available.49 Common carp is an important food fish, especially in Asia, and is produced extensively in aquaculture.50 The carp transcriptome has been studied elsewhere39,51,52 and recently a draft genome sequence was published.40We used the extensive zebrafish genomic resources available to annotate transcriptomes of three evolutionarily related, but non-model species that co-occur in parts of the west-central United States: Cyprinella lutrensis (red shiner), Platygobio gracilis (flathead chub) and Cyprinus carpio (common carp). These species were selected to reflect phylogenetic breadth, but also because their distributions overlap and occupy identical dryland river habitats (i.e. the Rio Grande, New Mexico), where they are exposed to similar biotic and abiotic conditions. Cyprinus carpio is native to Asia and Europe, but was introduced into North America, perhaps as early as 1831,53 and enthusiastically stocked throughout the US thereafter as a food fish, including New Mexico as early as 1889.54,Cyprinella lutrensis and Platygobio gracilis are both native to central and western North America, from the Mississippi River basin to the Rio Grande in New Mexico. Both C. lutrensis and C. carpio are highly tolerant of a wide range of environmental conditions and are highly invasive in areas outside of their natural range,55,56 whereas Platygobio gracilis is sensitive to environmental disturbance and imperiled or declining in several parts of its range.57Transcriptomes of Cyprinella lutrensis and Platygobio gracilis have not been published to our knowledge, whereas genomic and transcriptomic data are available for Cyprinus carpio.39,40,51,Cyprinella lutrensis and Platygobio gracilis are diploid (2n = 50), while Cyprinus carpio is allotetraploid 2n = 100,37 with some duplicated genes silenced after a lineage-specific whole genome duplication (i.e. Cc4R). Our aims in this study were to: (i) succinctly summarize and compare genes and functional annotation information obtained from various databases; (ii) test whether Cyprinus carpio expresses additional copies of particular genes compared to the two diploid species (Cyprinella lutrensis and Platygobio gracilis); (iii) identify potentially novel genes present in the three cyprinids that may underlie their unique ecological and morphological novelty and (iv) to assess evolutionary conservation of essential genes for development.In zebrafish, 307 genes are known to be essential for development. Knockout mutations in these genes are embryonic lethal according to experiments by Amsterdam et al.58 with subsequent revisions by Chen et al.59 and updates to the ENSEMBL database.60 These genes are highly conserved across extremely deep phylogenetic splits (e.g. yeast, fly, zebrafish, and human) due to their essential roles in development.58 Despite their importance, essential genes have not been studied in the context of comparative molecular ecology or ecological genomics of co-occurring species. Using transcriptome data presented in this study, we assessed the evolutionary conservation of the 307 zebrafish essential genes across four cyprinid lineages. We predicted that these genes would be highly conserved across all species, consistent with their critical functional roles, as compared to non-essential genes.61 If this is the case, then differences among species should be found in non-essential genes, such as lineage- or species-specific genes. We also tested whether both copies of duplicated genes in C. carpio (i.e. Cc4R Ohnologs) were retained and expressed in duplicate or whether one copy was evolutionarily lost.38,42 One mechanism for the loss of Ohnologs is ‘pseudogenization’,62 wherein a gene accumulates one or more internal stop codons that prevent formation of a functional protein product and thus becomes a pseudogene.63 If having redundant copies of essential genes were important for survival (e.g. due to loss-of-function mutations in one copy), then evolutionary retention of duplicates would likely be favored in C. carpio. Conversely, if regulation of proper gene expression levels were important in the context of functional pathways, then duplicated essential genes would likely be silenced at roughly the same rate as non-essential genes (although regulatory changes could also fine-tune expression patterns). We tested these hypotheses using expression data for the three cyprinid transcriptomes as compared to zebrafish. These sequences will provide resources for more detailed studies of the evolution and functional constraint of these critical genes, particularly in the context of genome expansions and reductions.2. Materials and methodsFish (n = 3 per species) were collected with a seine on 6 July 2012 from a field site on the Rio Grande, approximately 40 km south of Socorro, New Mexico (33.690556°N, 106.993042°W). Whole fish samples (juveniles or non-spawning adults) were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and transported to the laboratory. Skin, gill, gut, and kidney tissues were dissected and removed from frozen fish (outer layers were only slightly thawed by the time dissection was completed; <5 minutes total time), placed in TRIzol (Invitrogen), and mechanically homogenized. Total RNA was isolated using Purelink RNA Mini kits (Ambion) following manufacturer’s protocol, along with DNase treatment to reduce genomic DNA contamination. Purified total RNA was sent to the National Center for Genome Resources (Santa Fe, New Mexico, USA) for quantification, quality assessment, cDNA library preparation and sequencing. RNA integrity and purity was assessed with a Bioanalyzer 2100 instrument (Agilent Technologies). Thirty-six Illumina libraries were constructed (3 species × 4 tissues × 3 biological replicates) from the total RNA samples using Illumina TruSeq DNA prep kits according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Libraries were barcoded using standard six base pair Illumina oligonucleotides, and six libraries were pooled for each lane of Illumina HiSeq 2000 (V3 chemistry) for a total of six lanes of 2 × 100 bp paired-end sequencing.2.1. BioinformaticsWe used the bioinformatics pipeline outlined in Figure 1 for analyzing transcriptomic data in three main steps: de novo assembly, gene annotation, and analysis of expression of duplicated genes. Adapters and barcode sequences were removed from raw reads, and reads were trimmed using Trimmomatic64 with parameter settings as follows: leading quality = 5; trailing quality = 5; minimum trimmed read length = 36). Reads were normalized in silico to maximum read coverage of 50×. Clipped and trimmed reads were assembled, de novo, for each species separately using Trinity version 2014-04-13,65,66 with minimum contig length set to 200 bp. Libraries were pooled within a species for de novo assembly, to maximize the number of genes included. Trinity assembles reads into contigs (‘Trinity transcripts’), places similar transcripts in groups loosely referred to as ‘genes’, and groups similar ‘genes’ into gene clusters.

Databases queried and software packages used are listed.Putative protein coding genes were also identified by BLASTx searches of contigs against zebrafish (Danio rerio) peptide sequences (database build Zv9) obtained from Ensembl 78.60 Significant BLAST hits were identified based on the following parameter settings: E-value < 0.0001; gap open penalty = 11; gap extend = 1; wordsize = 3. After extensive testing, this parameter combination was found to give the optimal balance between finding matches for large numbers of contigs, while minimizing spurious hits. For most genes a 1–1 match was expected between zebrafish versus Platygobio gracilis or Cyprinella lutrensis, whereas zebrafish and Cyprinus carpio should have either 1-2 or 1-1 due to partial diploidy in carp. We used this expectation in determining the threshold E-value (i.e. E < 0.0001 in this study) to use. In practice, more stringent E-value thresholds (e.g. E < 1e-6) had very little effect on the number of significant BLAST hits.Contigs with no significant BLAST hits against the zebrafish transcriptome were subjected to a series of stepwise BLASTn searches until significant hits were found (or not) in order to identify the possible sources of those sequences (e.g. microbiome7) or to identify novel genes not present in the zebrafish genome. First, remaining contigs lacking significant hits against the zebrafish transcriptome were queried against the rRNA silva database (SSU Ref 119 NR99 and LSU Parc 119), which contains bacterial and eukaryotic rRNA sequences.67 Contigs with still no significant BLAST hits were then queried against a database containing all nine additional teleost fish transcriptomes (Amazon molly, Poecilia formosa; cavefish, Astyanax mexicanus; cod, Gadus morhua; fugu, Takifugu rubripes; medaka, Oryzias latipes; platyfish, Xiphophorus maculates; stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus; tetraodon, Tetraodon nigroviridis; tilapia, Oreochromis niloticus) from Ensembl 78. Contigs with no BLAST hits at this point were then BLASTed against the zebrafish genome (Zv9) using the ‘Top Level’ sequences from Ensembl to identify possible genomic DNA contamination. Remaining contigs with no significant blast hits in any of these databases were piped to TransDecoder66 to identify open reading frames (ORFs) that represent potentially novel genes. Default parameter settings were used with TransDecoder. The software generates predicted peptide sequences for contigs with ORFs. Predicted peptide sequences for the contigs with ORFs but no BLAST hits to the aforementioned databases were queried (BLASTp; E-value < 0.001) against the NCBI nr database. Blast2GO version 3.0,68 was used to identify top species hits for those predicted proteins with significant hits against nr. The remaining sequences with no hits to databases and no ORFs were discarded as likely non-protein coding, genomic DNA contamination with sufficient divergence from zebrafish to render genomic BLASTn searches ineffective.2.2. Genome duplication, diploidization and gene silencingTrimmed sequence reads were mapped to Trinity contigs using Bowtie2 version 2.2.2.369 and corresponding gene expression was quantified with RSEM version 1.2.13.70 Because RSEM is incompatible with indel, local, and discordant alignments, parameter settings were chosen to avoid these alignments. The following RSEM parameters were used: –sensitive; –dpad 0; –gbar 99999999; –mp 1,1 –np 1 –score-min L,0,-0.1; –no-mixed; –no-discordant. Normalized expression for Trinity genes was calculated by standardizing by total mapped reads across libraries and summed across alternate Trinity transcripts (isoforms) for each locus. Networks of co-expressed genes were identified for the three species using the WGCNA package in R.71 In order to assess the expression of duplicated genes in Cyprinus carpio arising from the Cc4R duplication event, we quantified the number of Trinity genes present in each species relative to zebrafish genes, as well as their expression levels. We used an arbitrary threshold of ten sequence reads per gene per tissue, summed across all three individuals, for a given gene to be considered ‘expressed’ in a particular tissue. Note that we are comparing whether or not a gene is expressed beyond a certain threshold, as opposed to quantifying levels of expression (i.e. RNA-seq). This approach was aimed at reducing the influence of unique reads (e.g. sequencing artifacts). Most of the contigs excluded as a result were contigs represented only by singleton reads in one library.For C. carpio, we tested whether certain functional classes of genes were preferentially expressed in duplicate (i.e. the case where neither ohnolog is silenced). For this analysis, we used Panther72 to test for statistical overrepresentation of GO-slim Biological Processes, with Bonferroni correction. The test genes consisted of the list of C. carpio ohnologs expressed in duplicate, while the list of all C. carpio genes present in the assembly was used as the reference set. GO terminology was based on the zebrafish database. Results of the overrepresentation analysis were visualized with Revigo.732.3. Essential genesTo test the hypothesis of evolutionary conservation of essential genes among cyprinid fishes, we used zebrafish genes present in the Online Gene Essentiality Database OGEE;59 and identified orthologs in the three transcriptomes from BLASTx searches described above. Of the 307 essential genes in zebrafish,58,59 one (ENSDARG00000038423) has been retired from ENSEMBL and one (ENSDARG00000045605) is an unprocessed pseudogene with no protein product. We searched for the remaining 305 genes in the three transcriptome assemblies to assess their conservation across cyprinids.583. Results3.1. Sequencing and transcriptome assembliesSix lanes of Illumina sequencing produced more than 1.2 billion paired-end reads, including 420.5-, 413.9-, and 385.3-million sequences in Cyprinus carpio, Cyprinella lutrensis, and Platygobio gracilis, respectively. De novo assembly resulted in high quality transcriptomes for all three species (Table 1). The C. carpio assembly had the largest number of contigs (‘Trinity transcripts’) and genes (‘Trinity genes’), while P. gracilis had the fewest. In contrast, metrics for contig length (N25, N50, N75, median contig length, average contig length) were all longer in P. gracilis than the other two species (Table 1; Fig. 2). Overall, the P. gracilis transcriptome assembly was more complete despite fewer raw sequence reads. TransDecoder predicted ORFs in about half of all Trinity contigs (not shown), with the remainder comprised mainly of genomic DNA contamination that was filtered out of the final dataset. The N50 of predicted ORFs was only slightly shorter in the three species (i.e. 1,299–1,572 bp) than in zebrafish (CDS N50 = 2,037 bp), and similar to the recently published draft C. carpio genome 1,487 bp.40 Removal of microbiome and genomic DNA contamination from the final assembly resulted in fewer, but longer contigs (see filtering of the final dataset, below), and an overall higher-quality assembly.

However, note that we only used canonical transcripts for zebrafish and not the shorter isoforms, which skews the distribution toward longer transcripts for that species.3.2. BLAST searches: zebrafish transcriptomeTop BLASTx hits of Trinity contigs against zebrafish peptides included approximately 20,000 unique genes (ENSDARG) and 11,000 protein families (ENSFAM) present in each of the three species (Fig. 3), suggesting similar annotation efficiency and transcriptome representation for each species. However, after pooling isoforms, the number of Trinity genes that significantly matched these ~20,000 zebrafish genes varied among species: 66,447 in Cyprinus carpio, 60,990 in Cyprinella lutrensis, and 39,915 in Platygobio gracilis (Table 2, top row). Zebrafish genes were well covered, with more than 15,000 unique zebrafish genes covered over at least 70% of their length in corresponding contigs from each of the three cyprinids, consistent with the N50 data presented above. In general, zebrafish proteins were more completely covered by P. gracilis contigs than C. carpio or C. lutrensis. For example, zebrafish genes were more than 90% covered (i.e. the alignment covers >90% of bases of a gene) by sequences in 50.3% (12,489 of 24,817 genes) of P. gracilis genes with significant zebrafish peptide hits, versus 49.9% (13,453 of 26,963) for C. carpio, and 46.8% (12,538 of 26,817) in C. lutrensis. A large number of Trinity contigs did not significantly match (BLASTx) zebrafish peptide sequences and were subsequently queried against several additional databases. Significant BLAST hits for Trinity ‘genes’ versus various databases and number of ORFs present. BLAST searches were done in stepwise fashion: all Trinity genes were queried against zebrafish peptides but only genes without zebrafish peptide hits were queried against rRNA silva, and so on until all of the databases were queried.

BLAST searches: other databasesContigs lacking significant BLASTx hits against zebrafish peptides were queried (BLASTn) iteratively against rRNA silva microbiome database, nine teleost transcriptomes, and the zebrafish genome databases (Table 2). For contigs lacking hits against zebrafish peptides, BLASTn searches versus the rRNA silva database revealed a small number of significant hits (i.e. <400 contigs; Table 2). BLASTn searches of the remaining unmatched contigs versus the nine teleost fish transcriptomes identified approximately 1,500–4,500 additional hits (Table 2), far fewer than the evolutionarily more closely related zebrafish transcriptome. BLASTn searches of the remaining unidentified contigs against the zebrafish genome revealed a large number of significant hits (>30,000 per species), suggesting these reads were the result of low levels of background genomic DNA contamination in the cDNA libraries, a common occurrence resulting from the hypersensitivity of Illumina sequencing. Conservation of sequences across deep evolutionary lineages suggests functional importance, such as regulatory regions.Despite extensive BLAST searches, a large number of Trinity contigs (>100,000 in each species or more than 50% of all contigs) did not have significant hits in any of the databases. These contigs are short in length (i.e. 200 bp) and have few reads mapping to them (e.g. single-read contigs). These could represent endogenous genomic DNA contamination of cDNA libraries and have sufficient evolutionary divergence from zebrafish to render BLASTn searches ineffective. A large number are also expected to be non-rRNA sequences from the microbiome, which were not present in target databases. Of contigs with no BLAST hits in the aforementioned databases, TransDecoder predicted ORFs in 8,652 (Cyprinus carpio), 9,215 (Cyprinella lutrensis), and 3,011 (Platygobio gracilis) contigs (Table 2). Roughly half of the predicted ORFs had significant BLASTp hits against the nr protein database (3,789, 4,154, and 1,548 contigs, respectively). Conversely, there were 4,863 (C. carpio), 5,061 (C. lutrensis), and 1,463 (P. gracilis) predicted ORFs had no significant hits against nr (Table 2). These ORFs could include novel genes not present in zebrafish or other teleost models, genes present in zebrafish but with significantly divergent sequences to cause BLAST searches to miss them, or could include genes from the microbiome that are not present in sequence databases.For ORFs with nr hits, zebrafish was the top-hit species for a large portion (Fig. 4), somewhat paradoxically given the lack of significant BLAST hits against zebrafish peptide and genome sequences discussed above. This appears to be due to the fact that TransDecoder-predicted ORFs exclude 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) which diverge more rapidly than ORFs over evolutionary time. In C. carpio and C. lutrensis, many of these ORFs are from a diverse microbiome with many sequences sharing significant similarity to cyclophyllid tapeworms (e.g. Echinococcus, Hymenolepis) and protozoans (e.g. Tetrahymena, Parameceum). Conversely, in P. gracilis the ORFs appear to be endogenous genes with high similarity to zebrafish (Fig. 4), i.e. a less diverse microbiome is present. Contigs with predicted ORFs but no BLAST hits to any of the databases possibly represent novel or functionally divergent genes in these species that warrant further study. Top-species BLASTp hits for predicted open reading frame (ORF) peptide sequences queried against the nr database. Query sequences only included ORFs from contigs that lacked significant BLAST hits (see Table 2).

Query sequences only included ORFs from contigs that lacked significant BLAST hits (see Table 2). Grey bars represent fish or other chordates, while black bars represent non-chordate taxa.3.4. Filtering and the final assembly datasetsAfter filtering and removal of genomic DNA and microbiome reads, the final de novo assembly datasets contained only Trinity contigs falling into one of the following categories: (i) contigs with significant BLAST hits against zebrafish or the nine other teleost transcriptomes; or (ii) contigs with no matches against any of the databases but with predicted ORFs present, i.e. potentially novel genes. All other contigs were removed via bioinformatic filtering. While it is possible that some of the ‘microbiome’ hits are actually external contamination, we expect this to be a minor component given the diverse nature of these sequences in terms of top-hit organism (Fig. 4). It is also possible that some of the genes that significantly align against zebrafish are actually microbiome or contaminant reads, though these genes being target species DNA is a more parsimonious conclusion. The final datasets are significantly smaller than the raw de novo assembly but present much more reliable sequence information, i.e. transcriptome sequences rather than microbiome or genomic DNA contamination.3.5. Genome duplication, diploidization and gene silencingTranscriptome annotation and comparison with zebrafish revealed that Cyprinus carpio expresses more genes than Cyprinella lutrensis and Platygobio gracilis, due to the Cc4R duplication (Fig. 5). Cyprinus carpio expressed about 41% more genes overall than P. gracilis and 11% more than C. lutrensis. The number of duplicate genes expressed varied dramatically among tissue types (Fig. 5). In all tissues except skin, C. carpio expressed more genes than the other two species (i.e. 3–48% more). In skin, both C. lutrensis and P. gracilis expressed more genes than C. carpio (26 and 2%, respectively). Using higher thresholds for ‘expression’ had moderate impact on the inferred percentage of duplicates expressed: a threshold of 100 reads instead of 10 resulted in different estimates of duplicated genes expressed in C. carpio versus P. gracilis (18% more in C. carpio) and C. lutrensis (8% more in C. carpio), i.e. retained expression of Cc4R duplicates. The disparity in these results could be driven in part by different assembly qualities (e.g. a better assembled P. gracilis transcriptome). WGCNA analysis revealed broadly similar patterns of blocks of co-expressed genes across species, consistent with the phylogenetic relatedness of the three species (Fig. 6).

One functional grouping that was a predominant contributor in the Revigo analysis was ‘anatomical structure morphogenesis,’ of interest because common carp attain much larger body size than the other two species (Fig. 7, bottom panel).

Expression of essential genesGenes that are essential for embryonic development in D. rerio were nearly all present in the three cyprinids: 285 (Platygobio gracilis), 301 (Cyprinella lutrensis), and 301 (Cyprinus carpio) genes were expressed out of 305 zebrafish essential genes (i.e. 93.4–97.8%). Of the 20 essential genes that we did not detect in P. gracilis, only one was also missing in C. lutrensis, and two were shared with C. carpio. No missing essential genes were shared between C. lutrensis and C. carpio, of the four missing in each species. Essential genes missing in one or more species were generally expressed at low levels in the other species. Essential genes were nearly ubiquitously expressed across all four tissue types (skin, gill, gut, kidney), with low levels of tissue specificity (Fig. 8), in contrast to non-essential genes which generally exhibited higher levels of tissue specificity. A few essential genes do exhibit patterns of tissue specificity or species-specificity. For example, C. carpio expresses more essential genes in the gut than the other two species, including genes such as wdr46 and exosc8, which are missing in both of the other species. Normalized levels of expression were higher in C. carpio than P. gracilis and C. lutrensis for 165 and 204 out of 305 genes, respectively. This pattern was not due to C. carpio expressing more loci per zebrafish gene (e.g. Ohnologs) than the other two species. Only slightly more loci (e.g. n = 2 contigs) were expressed per essential gene in the recently duplicated C. carpio genome (Fig. 9) whereas most duplicated essential genes in C. carpio are not transcribed and have either been lost evolutionarily, e.g. pseudogenes, or are expressed in other developmental stages or tissues.

DiscussionNext-generation transcriptome sequencing has revolutionized the field of molecular ecology over the past decade.4,74 One outcome is increased appreciation for the molecular complexity underlying the evolution of basic ecological traits.75,76 Here we present transcriptomic resources for comparative study of non-model cyprinid fishes in a natural ‘common-garden’ setting. Previous work, along with our bioinformatic analyses demonstrate that careful processing and filtering is needed to assess the sources of DNA fragments, which can be endogenous target transcriptome sequences, genomic DNA ‘contamination’ from the study organism, or DNA from the microbiome or diet items. Assessment of transcriptome quality also requires careful consideration.77,78 Traditional measures of assembled read lengths such as N50 are largely meaningless for transcriptomes without additional context. We advocate combining N50 and/or histograms of contig lengths with explicit comparisons to well-studied transcriptomes of model organisms, when available. For example, we compared our de novo transcriptomes to zebrafish, which yielded valuable insight into progress made in our target species. Finally, positive identification of nearly all zebrafish essential genes in our transcriptomes provides additional evidence of the utility of our annotation procedures. Using the bioinformatics pipeline presented in Fig. 1, we obtained high quality transcriptome data from three species of cyprinid fishes with distinctly different evolutionary histories.Our specific aims in this study were to sequence, annotate, and assemble the transcriptomes of co-occurring fishes with the goal of developing resources for ongoing studies of the evolution and molecular ecology of North American cyprinids. This comparative transcriptome dataset offers tools to construct assays to pose and test hypotheses related to differences in DNA sequences, functional pathways, and expression patterns among organisms that are more or less closely related (i.e. comparative approach), but that also co-occur in nature and experience similar biotic and abiotic conditions, including exposure to similar suites of pathogens and water quality conditions, for example. These data are also a resource for identifying single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in transcribed genes,79 which could be used to explore functional or phenotypic variation within and among species.There are several key findings in this study, including: (i) high-quality transcriptome assemblies for cyprinid fishes that reveal broad similarities and evolutionary conservation of genes with zebrafish, but with some key differences; (ii) several potentially novel genes not identified in zebrafish that are candidates for studies of ecological and morphological novelty; (iii) diverse microbiomes that vary substantially among species, despite origin from a single collection locality; (iv) ubiquitous expression of essential genes for development in later ontogenetic stages (i.e. juveniles and adults) across a broad array of tissue types; (v) a large number of duplicate genes expressed in the tetraploid, Cyprinus carpio, representing a diverse suite of biological processes or gene ontologies. We discuss each of these findings in greater detail below.4.1. Assembly resultsThere are important considerations associated with conducting transcriptome analysis in a non-laboratory setting and in species lacking high-quality, well-annotated genomes.4,80,81 For example, it is necessary to identify ways to maximize the quality and completeness of de novo assemblies.77,80,82 Our assemblies are somewhat less complete than the zebrafish reference, but this was expected because zebrafish has been sequenced extensively at the genomic DNA level, empirically validated with RNA-seq, and refined by years of manual curation.Trinity assemblies resulted in proportionally fewer long contigs (e.g. > 1,000 bp) compared to zebrafish. Four factors account for this result. First, the microbiome is present in these sequences and many of the contigs are not endogenous, as reflected by top species hits in BLAST searches (Fig. 4). Second, a small amount of genomic DNA contamination persists despite DNase treatment during library preparation. Genomic contamination tends to be observed as short (e.g. 200 bp), shallow contigs often comprised of single-reads. Third, the de novo assemblies are more fragmented due to the short read technology employed, with multiple contigs often representing non-overlapping fragments of the same gene. This effect is particularly acute in genes with short sequence repeats (e.g. microsatellites). Finally, we only used the canonical zebrafish transcripts in this study, which excludes the shorter isoforms present in many genes and biases the zebrafish distribution toward longer sequences. Transcriptomes presented here represent an improvement (i.e. more sequences, higher coverage; longer relative N50) over earlier work on sequencing and assembling the common carp transcriptome using Roche 454 sequencing,39,51 due to the higher throughput, Illumina paired-end sequencing approach we employed. The bioinformatic approach we presented to identify and filter non-target sequences from the final dataset resulted in high quality and well annotated assemblies.4.2. Potentially novel genesResults of BLAST searches and ORF predictions helped us identify candidate genes that may represent novel species- or taxon-specific genes. Our interest in these genes lies in the idea that they may contain some of the functional elements responsible for extensive ecological and phylogenetic diversity present in the Cyprinidae, as in previous studies of lineage-specific gene family expansions.83–85 For example, expansion of the patristacin gene family in pipefish may be an important driver in the evolution of male pregnancy in that lineage.85 Many of the potentially novel genes we identified may prove to be false positives as more fish genomes are sequenced and annotated; however, these candidates would be an excellent starting point for researchers interested in targeted searches for genes or proteins underlying ecological novelty in cyprinids that may have arisen through local gene duplications, exon shuffling, horizontal transfer, or other mechanisms.4.3. Microbiome diversityAnother valuable aspect of transcriptome sequencing of samples taken from nature is the simultaneous generation of quantifiable data on the microbiome.86 These data are applicable to study of host-parasite dynamics, immune response, paired comparative population genetics or phylogeographic analysis of host and microbiota. When generating de novo transcriptome assemblies for focal species, it is imperative that microbiome sequences are identified and filtered out of final assemblies.87 Genome-scale sequence data is often lacking for the bacterial and metazoan microbiota on vertebrate samples, which complicates attempts at removal. We used an iterative and successive filtering approach to address this issue (Fig. 1) that provides valuable information on the likely source (e.g. exogenous or endogenous) of particular sequences or contigs. Transcriptome characterization studies often do not attempt to remove exogenous microbiome and genomic DNA contamination. Researchers should be cautious when using unfiltered sequence reads, particularly when they are compiled into massive databases that lack appropriate metadata.4.4. Conservation of essential genesGenes that are essential for embryonic development present interesting targets for studying genome evolution due to their critical functional importance.58,88,89 Essential genes also bear biomedical significance as many have been implicated in human diseases and developmental abnormalities.88 Our data demonstrate that essential ‘developmental’ genes previously identified in larval zebrafish58,59 are almost all ubiquitously expressed in juvenile or adults across a broad range of tissues, suggesting their importance is not simply limited to early ontogenetic stages or particular tissues. Previous work has shown that many of these genes are critical for basic cell function, which may underlie their ubiquitous expression.58 Based on the critical functions they perform, these genes are candidates for future studies looking at the cause of high rates of genetic inviability and mortality in cyprinids and other organisms with type-III life histories.90 From a practical standpoint, however, we suggest that the ubiquitous expression of these genes makes their sequencing coverage and completeness useful metrics that should be used to assess the quality and completeness of de novo transcriptome assemblies, analogous to the use of ‘housekeeping’ genes as positive controls in qPCR studies.91 The presence of nearly all essential genes across these four cyprinid species (representing more than 100 million years of evolutionary divergence92) is consistent with the hypothesis of broad evolutionary and functional conservation.58,61 The few essential genes not detected may still be present in the genome, but were missed due to assembly errors or are expressed transiently at larval or juvenile developmental stages. We propose that the number of essential genes expressed could be used as a metric to complement other measures of assembly quality and completeness,77 in addition to comparing transcript length histograms to closely related model species (see Fig. 2). While beyond the scope of the present study, future work should compare the utility of these metrics for assessing transcriptome assemblies.4.5. Tetraploidy and expression of duplicated genesOur results indicated that a large number of duplicate genes are expressed in Cyprinus carpio, representing a diverse suite of biological processes or gene ontologies, similar to previous studies.39,40,51 For genes where both Ohnologs were expressed in C. carpio, there was enrichment in several different functional pathways, but many genes were associated with ‘anatomical structure morphogenesis’ in particular (Fig. 7). Functional duplicates at these genes correlate with large body size and rapid growth in C. carpio as compared to C. lutrensis and P. gracilis and a potential dosage effect. Using a different set of tissues, Wang et al.39 identified enrichment of retained expression of duplicates in gene ontology pathways involved in metabolic and immune functions using 454 transcriptome sequencing and EST data mining. The availability of a (draft) genome for common carp40 will eventually help identify Ohnologs that are silenced because pseudogenes of silenced genes may still be present in genomic DNA sequences; currently, the incomplete annotation of that genome precludes analysis of gene silencing at the genomic DNA level. Ultimately, knowledge of which genes are retained and expressed in duplicate in tetraploids as compared to related diploid species can provide insight into the role that whole genome duplication plays in the molecular ecology and phylogenetic diversification of organisms.93,94 Note that our analyses and those of Wang et al.39 are based only on expressed genes in particular tissues at a single time point, rather than genomic DNA sequences and consequently would not include Ohnologs expressed only in different tissues or at different time points. The recent Cc4R allotetraploidy event35,95,96 complicates transcriptome assembly because there has been little time for divergence of Ohnologs e.g, 8.2 million years.40 In autopolyploid salmonids, the fourth round of whole genome duplication is much older i.e. 90–102 ma;97 yet many Ohnologous loci are difficult to separate via bioinformatic approaches. Some loci even maintain tetrasomic inheritance because of the autopolyploid nature of the duplication.98 These factors need to be explicitly considered when conducting analyses that require orthologous alignments, such as RNA-seq and syntenic mapping, when working with polyploid or partially diploidized species.384.6. SummaryResults from short read sequences yield high-quality transcriptome resources for comparative study of cyprinids, a hyper-diverse clade of fishes. We used a variety of bioinformatic tools for assembly quality assessment, gene annotation, orthology assignment, and identification and partitioning of exogenous DNA in wild cyprinid fishes. This approach facilitates technology transfer from a model organism (zebrafish) to a group of related species that fill diverse and critical roles in these ecosystems and comprise an important component of biodiversity. Conserved expression of essential developmental genes across a broad phylogenetic scope, later ontogenetic stages, and array of tissue types, illustrates their utility as benchmarks for assessing coverage in de novo assemblies. Moreover, their ubiquitous expression further supports the hypothesis that these genes are required for the basic biology of cyprinid fish and are candidate loci for developmental abnormalities and disease. Finally, comparative transcriptomics must contend with genome duplications and other genomic ‘events’ that affect gene identity and expression. Nonetheless, comparative approaches could provide enormous power to identify shared and unique physiological pathways that respond to common environmental stressors in a natural setting.4.7.

IntroductionThe causal agent of frogeye leaf spot (FLS), Cercospora sojina Hara, is a worldwide destructive pathogen on soybean.1 It was first reported in Japan in 1915.2 After that, many soybean growing countries were reported the occurrence of this disease, such as the USA, China, and Argentina.3 The main measurement to control this disease is to grow resistant soybean varieties or to apply chemical fungicides, which usually lose the effects rapidly in fields due to race differentiation and gene mutations of the pathogen.4–6 FLS causes about 10–60% yield loss in soybean growing regions, such as Argentina and Nigeria, and it has been reported to be the most expensive disease in the history of soybean production in Argentina.3Taxonomically, C. sojina belongs to the order Capnodiales in the class of Dothideomycetes. Currently, it is known that there are 22 races of C. sojina in Brazil and 12 races in the USA.1 Later, using 93 isolates of C. sojina and 38 putative soybean differentials, Mian et al. proposed a core set of 11 races that represent the major diversity of the 93 isolates in the USA.1 We previously reported the 14 races in north China7; of the identified races of C. sojina, the occurrence frequency of race 1 is 43.5%, emerging as the dominant race among others, which causes yield loss up to 38% in the field.7Despite the importance of C. sojina, the infection mechanism and the genetic information are not known for this pathogen. For example, most of the species can produce a non-specific coloured mycotoxin cercosporin in the Cercospora genus, which is indispensable for their pathogenicity,8 but C. sojina may not produce cercosporin.9 Does the genome harbour the cercosporin biosynthesis genes? Nowadays, the main strategy to unravel the mystery of the pathogen infection mechanisms is to obtain their genome information. Magnaporthe grisea, one of the best studied fungi, was sequenced at genome level in 2005.10 The genome annotation shows that the pathogen may carry over 700 secreted proteins, and most of them are believed to be virulence effectors. Later, several effectors have been implicated in suppressing immune responses in rice.11,12 The other genes, such as MoEnd3, MoSwi6, and MoHYR1 have been demonstrated to be essential for appressorium formation, melanin accumulation, and reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenging.13–15 Similarly, the genome sequence availability and gene annotation have helped to uncover the infection mechanism of Verticillium dahliae substantially, where this pathogen shows distinct infection structure compared with M. oryzae and other fungi.16,17Although the breeding programme and fungicide application make great success in controlling FLS in last decades, their efficiencies are facing challenges recently.4,7 In fact, Cercospora species may undergo positive selections and rapid evolution. Soares et al. reported that more Cercospora species were able to infect soybean and caused similar disease symptom as C. kikuchii, the closest species of C. sojina.3 Importantly, they detected interlineage recombination among Cercospora species, along with a high frequency of mutations linked to fungicide resistance.3 Moreover, it has been observed that C. sojina populations are genetically diverse and likely undergoing sexual reproduction.18 The above-mentioned reports imply that C. sojina could adapt to the changing environment flexibly.In this study, we report the 40.8 Mb complete genome sequence of C. sojina race 1. The genome annotation and whole genome transcriptome assays reveal that C. sojina encodes a different set of proteins that distinguishes it from other fungi species in terms of infection strategy and disease development. We demonstrate that the secondary metabolites and effectors play essential roles in the soybean–C. sojina pathosystem. Moreover, the genome information can be further used for comparative genomic studies with other Cercospora species to unravel their evolution and infection mechanism on soybean.2. Materials and methods2.1. Fungal growth conditions and DNA preparationCercospora sojina (C. sojina) race 1 was isolated from soybean fields in Heilong Jiang province of China. Briefly, the fungi single spore was isolated from the soybean seedling infested by C. sojina race 1. The isolated spores were grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium at 28°C. Then, the mycelia were removed from the media and ground in liquid nitrogen. Genomic DNA was extracted using a modified cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method.192.2. Genome sequencing and assemblyCercosporasojina race1 genome was sequenced by Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) method in Biomarker Technologies (Beijing, China).20 DNA libraries with 270 bp and 10 kb inserts were constructed. The 270-bp library was constructed following Illumina’s standard protocol, including fragmentation of genomic DNA, end repair, adaptor ligation and PCR amplification. The 270-bp library was quantified using 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA) and subjected to paired-ended 150 bp sequencing by Illumina HiSeq4000. The sequencing data (filtered reads: 2.99G, sequencing depth: 90×) were used to estimate the genome size, repeat content, and heterozygosity. Then, the 10-kb library was constructed following PacBio’s standard methods, including fragmentation of genomic DNA, end repair, adaptor ligation, and templates purification. The 10-kb library was quantified by 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA) and sequenced by SMRT, and the sequencing data (filtered reads: 4.92G, sequencing depth: 123×) was assembled by CANU (Version-1.2) with default parameters.21 Finally, Illumina reads were used for error correction and gap filling with SOAPdenovo GAPCLOSER v1.12.222.3. Genome annotationsProtein-encoding genes were annotated by a combination of three independent ab initio predicators GeneMark (Version 4.30),23 SNAP24, and Glimmer.25 Transcriptome data were incorporated into PASA26 to improve quality of C. sojina annotation. Briefly, the transcriptome assemblies were mapped to the genome using Trinity.27 Then PASA alignment assemblies based on overlapping transcript alignments from Trinity and use EVidenceModeler (EVM) to compute weighted consensus gene structure annotations. Finally, PASA was used to update the EVM consensus predictions. Functional annotations for all predicted gene models were made using multiple databases, including Swiss-Prot, nr, KEGG28, and COG29 by blastP with E-values of =1e-5. Domain-calling analyses of protein-encoding genes were performed using the Pfam database30 and HMMER.31 Potential virulence-related proteins were identified by searching against the pathogen–host interaction database (PHI-base)32 by blastP with E-values of =1e-5. Blast2GO33 was used for Go enrichment analysis of genes that only belong to C. sojina, and do not have homologue in the non-plant pathogen Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa. 2.4. Repetitive sequences and whole genome DNA methylation analysisTandem repeat sequences were identified using Tandem Repeats Finder (TrF).34 Transposable elements (TEs) were excavated strictly using three softwares, including a de novo software Repeat Modeler (http://repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler/) and two database-based softwares Repeat Protein Masker (www.repeatmasker.org/cgi-bin/RepeatProteinMaskRequest) and Repeat Masker (www.repeatmasker.org/). All the parameters are set as default. Whole-genome DNA modification detection and motif analysis were performed according to Blow et al.35 using the PacBio SMRT software (version = 2.2.3, www.pacb.com). 2.5. Phylogenetic analysis and synteny analysisThe sequences of fungi were downloaded from DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI).36 A group of consistent phylogenetic ‘backbone’ genes (phylogeneticly conserved) in the fungi genome were used to construct phylogenetic tree.37 Putative ‘backbone’ genes of the other 11 fungi were identified using stand-alone blast with E-values of =1e-20. And the ‘backbone’ genes were concatenated into one sequence. Sequence alignment was done using MUSCLE38 and the phylogenetic tree was generated by MEGA 7.039 using a UPGMA method. Ustilago maydis was used as outgroup. Synteny of Cercospora zeae-maydis, C. sojina, and Pseudocercospora fijiensis was analysed using GATA.402.6. Comparison analysis of carbohydrate-active enzymes and secondary metabolism genesThe proteome of C. sojina and 14 other above-mentioned fungal species were downloaded from DOE Joint Genome Institute (JGI).36 HMMER 3.0 packages were used for homology search.41 Family-specific HMM profiles were downloaded from dbCAN database.42 The executable file hmmscan and the hmmscan-parser script provided by dbCAN were used to generate and extract the searching results, respectively.Putative polyketide synthases (PKS) and non-ribosomal peptide synthases (NRPS) genes were identified using the web-based software SMURF with default settings.43 The modules of different domains in individual NRPS and PKS proteins were identified via searching the antiSMASH database (antibiotics and Secondary Metabolite Analysis Shell).44 The core genes were annotated using stand-alone BLAST (E-values =1e-10) against Swiss-Prot database.2.7. Secondary metabolites extraction and quantificationCercosporin extraction and quantification were performed according to the method described by Shim and Dunkle.45 The pigments of C. sojina were induced in the complete medium (CM) with 20 mmol/l cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) or starvation treatments for 4 days at 28°C. The supernatants were collected and purified by the C18-SPE cartridge. The elutes in 40% methanol fraction were further purified by a HPLC on C18 preparation column. The fractions with grey, light yellow, and dark grey were further identified by a reverse phase HPLC with a PDA detector (Shimadzu Corporation, Japan).2.8. Transcriptome analysis and quantitative RT-PCRFor transcriptome analysis, the fungus was grown in minimal nutrient medium (3 g NaNO3, 1 g K2HPO4, 0.5 g MgSO4·7H2O, 0.5 g KCl, 0.01 g FeSO4, and 30 g Sucrose per litre) at 28°C for 6 days. For starvation treatment, the fungal mycelia was transferred to minimal nutrient medium lacking NaNO3, then was harvested at 24 and 48 h, respectively. Each treatment had three biological replicates.Library preparation and bioinformatics analysis were performed according to the method of Yang et al.46 One microgram RNA per sample was subjected to RNA-seq library construction. The RNA-seq libraries were quantified using 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent, USA), and sequenced (paired-end, 100 bp each) by the Illumina genome analyzer (Hiseq 2000; Illumina, USA). Quantification of gene expression levels were estimated by fragments per kilobase of transcript per million fragments mapped. Differential expression analysis was performed using the DESeq R package.For quantitative RT-PCR, infected leaves were collected at indicated time points. Total RNA was extracted by Trizol method (Invitrogen). The cDNAs were synthesized using HiScript II Q RT SuperMix kit with genomic DNA wiper (Vazyme Biotech). Reactions were performed on CFX96TM Real-time System (Bio-RAD) with the SYBR qPCR Mix (Vazyme Biotech). The 2-<U+0394><U+0394>CT method was used for calculating the relative gene expression levels. Actin gene of C. sojina was used as the internal control.2.9. Functional study of putative effectorsThe putative effector genes were cloned into binary vector pMD-1 (T7 tag) driven by 35S promoter using ClonExpress II One Step Cloning Kit (Vazyme Biotech). Then, these constructs were transformed into Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain EHA105 by electroporation. Leaves of 4-week-old Nicotiana benthamiana were infiltrated with EHA105 strains harbouring indicated effectors using needleless syringes. GFP and Phytophothora sojae effector Avr1b served as the negative control and positive control, respectively. Twenty-four hours later, plants were infiltrated with EHA105 harbouring pVX-BAX (OD600 = 0.4). Cell death symptoms were evaluated and photographed at 72 h after pVX-BAX infiltration. Results are representatives of six biological replicates.3. Results3.1. Assembly of C. sojina genomeLike most of the fungi, C. sojina showed similar infection cycle, but it also demonstrated some distinctions (Supplementary Fig. S1). It does not form appressorium, but infects the plants by branched hyphae through open stomata (Supplementary Fig. S1C and D). Compared with other hemibiotrophic fungi, FLS disease development is relatively slower (Supplementary Fig. S1C). In order to investigate the infection mechanism, we therefore extracted the genomic DNA from the mycelia and sequenced the pathogen at genome level.The genome of C. sojina race 1 was assembled from the data generated by a recently developed Single Molecule Real-Time (SMRT) sequencing technique, an effective method to decode the difficulty to detect but important regions, such as non-coding regions and repetitive elements, which can assist in obtaining gapless eukaryotic genome sequence.20Subreads distribution analyses confirm the high quality of the 10-kb library (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S1). The sequencing data (4,920,479,113 bp clean reads) were de novo assembled using CANU,21 leading to the generation of 62 contigs, with an N50 length of 1.59 Mb and a total assembly size around ~40.84 Mb (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). Twenty-four largest scaffolds were displayed by circos-plot (Fig. 1). A total of 11,655 protein-coding genes are predicted, in which the gene density is ~285 genes per 1 Mb. However, 277 tRNA and 281 pseudogenes are predicted in the genome. Notably, 8,474 putative protein-coding genes were supported by the RNA-seq data. It is also worth noting that the genome size of C. sojina race 1 is much larger than C. sojina isolate S9, where the genome was assembled by 124 bp library and genome size was estimated around ~30.8 M.47Genome features of Cercospora sojinaGenome features of Cercospora sojinaCircos-plot of C. sojina.

Repetitive elements and potential methylation sitesRepetitive DNA sequence and TEs play important roles in the evolution, the genome structure, and gene functions of fungi.48 A total of 11,138,239 bp (~11 M) repeat sequences were identified in C. sojina genome, including DNA transposon, LTR retrotransposon, tandem repeat sequence and other unclassified transposons (Fig. 2A). The repeat sequence accounts for 25.56% of the genome. Interestingly, the majority of repetitive sequences (96.36%) are TEs, whereas the tandem repeat sequences just account for 0.93%. Notably, DNA transposon and LTR retrotransposons account for 28 and 25% of all TEs, respectively. Repeat elements and DNA methylation sites of C. sojina.

However, majority of methylation sites (8,453,041) were uncategorized. Interestingly, most of the categorized DNA methylations are m4C, accounting for 98.3%, whereas m6A only accounts for 1.7%. In consistent with the identified methylation sites, we detect multiple motifs that may be recognized by transmethylase specifically (Supplementary Table S3). However, compared with m6A, m4C DNA methylations occur with low frequency in the regions of repetitive elements (Fig. 2C–E).3.3. Comparative genomic analysisThe evolutionary relationship of C. sojina and other fungi species was analysed using a group of phylogenetic backbone genes of the fungi.37 Phylogenetic analysis reveals that C. sojina is evolutionally close to Cercospora zeae-maydis, a plant pathogen that can cause leaf spot disease on maize52 (Fig. 3A). In addition, C. sojina is also close to the other three Dothideomycetes pathogen Pseudocercospora fijiensis, Sphaerulina musiva, and Dothistroma septosporum (Fig. 3A). The C. sojina homologous proteins show an average identity of 79.9, 65.9, 67.5, and 65.8% with that of C. zeae-maydis, P. fijiensis, S. musiva, and D. septosporum, respectively.

Non-coding regions are not depicted.Although C. sojina is evolutionarily distant from the non-plant pathogen Aspergillus nidulans and Neurospora crassa, 47.18 and 43.07% proteins of C. sojina have homologues in A. nidulans and N. crassa, respectively. Therefore, we examined the potential gene family expansions in C. sojina. The results show that 5,652 genes exclusively exist in C. sojina genome but not in A. nidulans and N. crassa. However, near 70% of these genes cannot be annotated from current databases (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Go enrichment analysis of the 1,675 annotated genes reveals that most of the genes are involved in metabolic process, biosynthetic process, and response to stresses or stimuli (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Notably, these genes are predicted to have binding function (ion binding or protein binding), hydrolase activity, transferase activity or oxidoreductase activity (Supplementary Fig. S3C). As C. sojina is evolutionarily distant from the non-plant pathogens, we speculate that the gene family expansion, a common event in the evolution of phytopathogenic fungi,52,53 might have occurred in C. sojina genome, which eventually makes C. sojina be a plant pathogen.In addition, synteny analysis of C. sojina genome with the other three genomes of Dothideomycetes spp., the C. zeae-maydis, P. fijiensis, and Mycosphaerella graminicola, reveals that C. sojina genome displays different synteny with those fungi (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S4). Of all the sequenced genomes, C. zeae-maydis shows highest synteny with C. sojina. For example, scaffolds 2, 4, and 5 of C. zeae-maydis correspond well with the scaffold 1 of C. sojina, and Scaffold 3 and 10 show well syntney to the scaffold 3 of C. sojina (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Importantly, we observed that the 24 largest scaffolds, which accounts for 91.2% of C. sojina genome, show very high synteny with the 13 core chromosomes of M. graminicola,53 but not with the rest 8 dispersed chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S4C), indicating that C. sojina shares the conserved and core genes of Dothideomycetes.3.4. The secretome and potential effectorsThe genome of C. sojina contains 11,655 protein-coding genes, covering approximately 41% sequence of the genome (Table 1). Among them, a total of 9,506 genes were annotated using multiple databases (Supplementary Fig. S5 and Table S4). Domain calling analysis reveals that more than 7,500 types of domains exist in C. sojina proteome. The arsenal of potentially secreted proteins were predicted, and proteins containing a signal peptide, but lacking transmembrane domain and glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) modification site were considered as secreted proteins. A combination of software tools for the prediction of transmembrane domain,54 signal peptide motifs,55 and GPI modification site indicate that C. sojina has similar number of potential secreted proteins (~750) when compared with other fungal species.56Pathogen-secreted effectors play critical roles in facilitating the proliferation of pathogens, often by suppressing plant immune system.57 In total, 233 proteins are predicted as the putative small (=400 amino acids) cysteine-rich (=4 cysteine residues) proteins. Through domain calling analysis, 205 functional motifs and domains were found in 141 putative effectors, including 60 effectors with multiple domains. Notably, the most abundant domain is PF14295.4 (n = 6), which mediates protein-protein interactions. Other common domains include abhydrolase domain (PF12697.5, n = 5), Hydrolase domain (PF12146.6, n = 5), and PAN domain (PF00024.24, n = 5).3.5. Up-regulation of pathogenicity-related genes by whole genome transcription assaysBecause the infection progress of C. sojina on soybean is very slow, it is difficult to collect enough samples to examine the gene expression of the in planta hyphae. However, starvation treatments could mimic the physiology of pathogen during infection.58 Therefore, we used the mycelia that were grown in nutrient-limited culture for 24 and 48 h, and performed transcriptome analysis by RNA sequencing; 3,227 and 3,223 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were identified at 24 and 48 h post-starvation treatment (hpt), respectively (Supplementary Fig. S6). A total of 4,051 DEGs were identified during starvation treatment, and 2,399 genes were differentially expressed at both 24 and 48 hpt. Of all the DEGs, 1,530 and 1,508 genes were upregulated, while 1,697 and 1,715 genes were downregulated at 24 and 48 hpt, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S6).Notably, four classes of DEGs caused our attention. These genes are annotated to be involved in PHI, secretome, putative carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), and secondary metabolic processes. First, 1,036 PHI genes are differentially expressed after starvation treatment (Supplementary Fig. S7A). A total of 591 PHI genes are significantly upregulated, demonstrating the important roles of these genes in responding to stimulus. Second, 260 secreted protein-coding genes, including 81 effectors, are differentially expressed (Supplementary Fig. S7B). There is 62.5% (50/80) effector-coding gene expression being significantly upregulated, and some effectors with conserved domains, such as Wall Stress-responsive Component domain, glycoside hydrolase, fungal hydrophobin, cutinase, leucine rich repeat or peptidase domains, may play critical roles in fungal pathogenicity (Supplementary Table S5). Third, 198 CAZymes were differentially expressed. Interestingly, almost half of them are glycoside hydrolases (87/198), implying their essential roles in early infection (Supplementary Fig. S7C). Further, the secondary metabolism-related genes, including 5 PKS and 16 NRPS/NRPS-like genes are significantly upregulated (Supplementary Fig. S7D). These genes are likely involved in mycotoxin biosynthesis in fungi. Therefore, the increased expression of PKS and NRPS/NRPS-like genes suggests that these genes may play essential roles in mycotoxins biosynthesis (Supplementary Table S6).3.6. Gene clusters for secondary metabolitesCercosporasojina genome encodes 16 non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), 20 PKS, 18 fatty acid synthases, 3 terpene synthases, 2 geranylgeranyl diphosphate synthases, and 1 terpenoid cyclases (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8). These enzymes are involved in synthesis of secondary metabolites, including mycotoxins, pigments, and alkaloids. Annotation of secondary metabolite biosynthesis genes shows that C. sojina lacks PKS-NRPS hybrids, PKS-like proteins, and dimethylallyl tryptophan synthases (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8).In the Cercospora genus, most of the species can produce a non-specific mycotoxin cercosporin. However, it has been disputed that if C. sojina produces cercosporin.9 Nevertheless, we identified a similar gene cluster with eight cercosporin biosynthesis genes in C. sojina genome (Fig. 4A). These eight genes display high amino acid sequence similarity to C. nicotianae cercosporin biosynthesis genes in the same tandem order (Fig. 4A). Furthermore, we observed the increased transcription of the eight genes during infection (Fig. 4B). These data imply that C. sojina may produce cercosporin during infection. However, we were unable to detect the cercosporin in either cultured mycelium or infected plant tissue according to the method that was used in other Cercospora species (Supplementary Fig. S8). Putative gene clusters for cercosporin biosynthesis in C. sojina. (A) The eight cercosporin toxin biosynthetic genes in C. sojina genome.

Generally, pathogen-produced pigment is able to protect pathogen from host oxidative stress during infection.59 We found that C. sojina genome encodes multiple putative PKS that are responsible for pigment production (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Table S7). We also found that C. sojina can produce some grey pigments, and the pigment was significantly induced by both starvation and cAMP treatments (Fig. 5B), suggesting that the pigments may be related to pathogen virulence. Therefore, we further isolated and partially purified the pigments. Three major components, the grey, the light yellow, and the dark grey pigments were obtained (Supplementary Fig. S9), and the dark grey pigment is the most abundant one.

Carbohydrate-active enzymesSuccessful phytopathogenic fungi can break down and utilize the plant cell wall polysaccharides by CAZymes. Cercosporasojina harbours 596 predicted CAZymes (Supplementary Table S9). Compared with other fungi in Dothideomycetes, C. sojina has a larger group of potential carbohydrate esterases, which can catalyze the O-de- or N-deacylation of substituted saccharides60,61 (Supplementary Table S9). In C. sojina genome, there are around 23.5% potential secreted proteins (177/752) that were predicted as CAZyme, demonstrating that C. sojina may employ a large group of CAZymes to digest host cell walls during invasion.Interestingly, one of the families of CAZymes, the glycoside hydrolase GH109 family, is highly enriched (Fig. 6). The biochemical function of GH109 family is proved to be a-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (aNAGAL), which can cleave the terminal alpha-linked N-acetylgalactosamine epitope of blood group A.62 However, it has been shown that soybean lectin can specifically bind N-acetyl galactosamine, a component of fungal cell wall.63 These data suggest that aNAGAL may be able to compete with lectin to bind N-acetylgalactosamine. We find that C. sojina encodes 14 putative GH109 genes, which is more than most of fungi, such as M. oryzae, B. cinerea, and N. crassa (Supplementary Table S10). These data suggest that the expansion of GH109 family in C. sojina may contribute to overcome lectin-mediated resistance in soybean.

The numbers of gene families were normalized by Z score.Of the annotated carbohydrate esterase genes, family CE1 and CE10 are two major subfamilies (Fig. 6). Both families encode proteins with the common activities of carboxylesterase and endo-1,4-ß-xylanase.64 Besides, 34 potential carbohydrate-binding module (CBM) proteins were identified in C. sojina genome (Supplementary Table S9), which can digest carbohydrate complex extracellularly.64 Unexpectedly, only one CBM protein CBM1 was found in C. sojina genome (Supplementary Table S9). However, many phytopathogenic fungi carry plenty of CBM1. For example, Verticillium dahlia has an expansion of CBM1 containing protein family (~30 genes).653.8. Functional analysis of putative effectorsEffectors are low molecular weight proteins that are secreted by bacteria, oomycetes or fungi to impair the host immune defence and to adapt to specific environment. In the maize pathogen U. maydis, it was observed that most of the genes in secreted protein-coding gene clusters were induced simultaneously in infected tissue.66 Phylogenetic analysis for 233 putative effectors reveals that 21 predicted effectors are grouped into clusters that contain 2 or 3 high sequence similarity genes in C. sojina (Fig. 7A). Clusters of putative effectors also suggest that local duplications might be involved in expansion of effectors in C. sojina. In addition, 40 putative effectors can be annotated by PHI database (Supplementary Table S11), and most of the annotated effectors have been implicated in fungal pathogenesis. Functional analysis of putative C. sojina effectors. (A) Phylogenetic analysis of putative effectors. The phylogenetic tree of 233 putative effectors is categorized into six super clades.

Quantitative RT-PCR (qRT–PCR) were used to determine gene expression levels. Values are mean ± SD (n = 3 biological replicates).Next, we attempt to investigate the effector function. Pro-apoptotic mouse protein BAX-induced programmed cell death (PCD) on N. benthamiana could physiologically resemble defence-associated hypersensitive response caused by pathogens, providing a valuable screening approach for effectors that can suppress defence-related PCD.67 We randomly selected 50 effectors and transiently expressed them in N. benthamiana to screen the potential effectors that can suppress BAX-triggered PCD (BT-PCD). Our results show that about 1/4 (13/50) selected effectors strongly suppress BT-PCD (Fig. 7B). Moreover, qRT-PCR results show that most of these putative effectors are transcriptionally induced at 48 h after C. sojina infection (Fig. 7C), implying they probably contribute to early infection on soybean.4. DiscussionCercospora species cause severe leaf spot and blight diseases on many crops worldwide.1 In this study, we sequenced the genome of the economically important fungi, C. sojina race 1. The genome size is ~40.84 Mb, and 25.56% of the genome is composed of repeat sequences. However, compared with the genome size of sequenced but not annotated C. sojina isolate using NGS method (IMG genome id: 2506520004, https://img.jgi.doe.gov/cgi-bin/m/main.cgi), C. sojina race 1 has a larger genome size (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S12). In particular, the assembled C. sojina genome by SMRT generates ~10 Mb repetitive sequences that are not detected by other sequencing techniques.DNA methylation is an important research area of epigenetics in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic. The most studied type of DNA methylation in fungi is m5C, while in prokaryotic it is m4C and m6A.68 Until recently, the methylase and demethylase for m6A in eukaryotic were identified. However, in fungi, this type of DNA modification is poorly studied. Using SMRT, we identified m6A and m4C in C. sojina for the first time, in which we found 17,407 m6A and 1,015,733 m4C in C. sojina genome (Fig. 2B). The m6A frequency in this fungus is 435.2/Mb, which is slightly more than 341.3/Mb in yeast.69 In bacteria, m6A is regarded as an epigenetic signal for DNA-protein interactions.70 Surprisingly, we also observe that C. sojina contains large numbers of m4C, which is only reported in bacteria to our knowledge.68 Interestingly, the m4C modification occurs with lower frequency in the region of repetitive elements in C. sojina genome (Fig. 2C and D), indicating that m4C may be involved in the transposition of the transposons. Our results also demonstrate that SMRT is a powerful tool in studying fungal genome epigenetic modification.It is worth noting that one of the enriched family is glycoside hydroxylate GH109 family (Fig. 6). This gene family encodes a-N-acetylgalactosaminidase (aNAGAL), an enzyme that can cleave N-acetyl galactosamine from the conjugated proteins.62 Interestingly, it has been found that lectin can specifically bind N-acetyl galactosamine.62 It is also found that soybean lectin can bind the N-acetyl galactosamine, a component of fungal cell wall.63 Therefore, the aNAGAL may compete with soybean lectin to bind N-acetyl galactosamine. It is known that soybean lectin and other plant lectins can inhibit hyphae growth and spore germination by binding their cell wall components in several fungi, such as Penicillia and Aspergilli species.71,72 We hypothesize that the expansion of GH109 family in C. sojina genome may contribute to overcome the lectin-mediated disease resistance in soybean.CBMs are the most common non-catalytic modules associated with enzymes active in plant cell-wall hydrolysis.73 They can increase enzyme efficiency by anchoring the enzyme’s catalytic region to insoluble cellulose.74 However, only one CBM1 protein was found in C. sojina genome (Supplementary Table S9). In light of their relative slower infection process, the deficiency of CBMs in the genome may undermine C. sojina infection in terms of digesting plant cell walls.It is believed that mycotoxin plays a critical role during pathogen infection.75 Mycotoxin cercosporin produced by Cercospora spp. is considered to be one of the key factors that can enhance their virulence, as their pathogenicity was remarkably impaired in the cercosporin-deficient mutants.75 However, C. sojina is one of the few Cercospora spp. that was reported not able to produce cercosporin, although there is a dispute.9 We made an effort to examine the cercosporin in either cultured mycelium or infected plant tissue. However, we are unable to detect cercosporin in any of the samples although the complete gene cluster for cercosporin biosynthesis exists in C. sojina genome (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S8). Therefore, our data imply that C. sojina may not employ cercosporin but other mycotoxin to enhance virulence.Fungi-derived pigments can act as virulence factors to facilitate infection in plants, and are required for pathogen fitness by serving as UV protectants and ROS scavengers.59 The well-studied fungal pigment is melanin, which essentially contributes to fungal pathogenesis by altering cytokine responses, decreasing phagocytosis and scavenging ROS, as well as playing an important role in reinforcing fungal cell wall.76 Similar as melanin, we observed some pigment production was induced by cAMP or starvation treatments (Fig. 5B). We also identified the key gene clusters that encode PKS in C. sojina genome (Fig. 5A and Table S7). Moreover, the whole genome transcriptome assays also demonstrate that the key genes that are involved in pigment biosynthesis are significantly up-regulated. These data further support the assumption that the pigments produced by C. sojina are involved in its virulence.In addition to secondary metabolites, pathogens usually harbour various virulence effectors. These effectors interfere with host immune responses to enhance virulence. For example, bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae delivers over 30 effectors by type III secretion system during infection.77 Our work showed that more than one third of the effectors were upregulated during starvation (Supplementary Fig. S7B), and many of them can suppress BAX-induced cell death (Fig. 7B), similar to the finding in Phytophothora sojae.67 These data demonstrate that C. sojina can probably deploy effectors to promote infection.In summary, we report a complete genome sequence of C. sojina by SMRT sequencing method. This sequencing method not only assists us to find the repetitive elements, but also to discover the DNA methylations in fungus. By the genome assembly and annotation, we hypothesize that the specific CAZymes, secondary metabolites, and effectors can help C. sojina to adapt to soybean successfully. Our work also lays the groundwork for future discoveries on this important soybean disease.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.Authors’ contributionsJ.L. and S.M. conceived the research plans; X.L., J.C., and J.H. performed the experiments; Z.W., Z.G., and Y.C. provided technical assistance; X.L., J.C., and J.L. wrote the article.FundingThe study was supported by Chinese Academy of Sciences (Strategic Priority Research Program Grant NO.

Gaertn) is an important crop for food security because of its tolerance to drought, which is expected to be exacerbated by global climate changes. Nevertheless, it is often classified as an orphan/underutilized crop because of the paucity of scientific attention.

Gaertn) is the coarse cereal that is most widely cultivated in dry regions under rain-fed conditions. Finger millet is an allotetraploid (2n = 4× = 36) with an AABB genome that belongs to the family Poaceae and subfamily Chloridoideae. It was domesticated from the wild allotetraploid E. africana in Uganda to Ethiopia more than 5000 years ago. It is widely accepted that the A genome progenitor is the wild diploid species E. indica (2n = 2× = 18) or one of its close relatives, including E. tristachya, while the B genome progenitor is unknown or most likely extinct.1,2,3,4 Finger millet is one of the richest sources of mineral elements such as calcium, iron, manganese, and zinc, in addition to being a fairly good source of vitamins and several essential amino acids.5 Among all millets, finger millet is often considered as the best source of lysine.6 With its high satiety value and low glycemic index, finger millet has excellent potential as a nutraceutical cereal. It is grown widely, including in India, many African countries, China, and, historically until the present day, even in Japan.7Despite its importance, very little research emphasis has been given to finger millet; hence, this species is classified as an orphan or underutilized crop.7,8 The major reasons for this classification include a distant relationship to any of the major cereals, a large genome size, and particularly, its tetraploidy. Thus, limited efforts have been made toward the generation of genomic resources for this species, including sequencing of its genome. The genome size of finger millet was estimated to be 3.34–3.87 pg (2C),7,9 which corresponds to 1.63–1.89 Gb in haploid (1C) cells assuming that 1 pg DNA corresponds to 978 Mbp with a GC content of 50%. Several attempts have also been made to prospect novel genes linked to the drought-stress acclimation response,10–13 and a small number of SSR markers for the construction of genetic linkage maps have been reported.14 The EcNAC1 gene of E. coracana, which encodes a NAC family transcriptional factor, was shown to be induced by drought and to confer resistance to drought and other stresses when expressed in tobacco.10 However, compared with the progress made in generating genomic information in sorghum and pearl millet, efforts in finger millet remain scarce. The absence of such genomic resources has been the major impediment in improving finger millet through the adoption of molecular breeding approaches.The genome assembly and annotation of polyploid species has been a major challenge in genomics, because homeologous genes (i.e. duplicated genes derived from genome duplication) are by definition highly similar and their separate assembly is difficult. About 35% of vascular plants are estimated to be recent polyploids,15,16 and it has long been known that important crop species are polyploids.17 However, the genome assemblies of only a handful of polyploid species have been reported. More importantly, the quality of the polyploid assembly, in particular the scaffold length, tends to be low in such reports. The presence of duplicated genes and polyploidy split the assembly, thus leading to shorter scaffolds and contigs.18,19Some polyploid species have, however, been assembled; e.g. Nicotiana tabacum,20,Gossypium hirsutum,21,Triticum aestivum,22 and Brassica juncea.23 The genome assembly of hexaploid wheat, Triticum aestivum (TGACv1),22 was performed via chromosome separation, albeit with an N50 of several kb.22 A combined approach of PacBio long reads and Bionano Genomics optical genome mapping succeeded in assembling the genome of Brassica juncea, which is an allotetraploid, with an N50 scaffold that was 1.5 Mb long.23 Subsequently, pseudochromosomes were constructed using the diploid genome and genetic linkage maps. However, in previous polyploid assemblies, little was reported on the validation of the separation of homeologs in cases with unknown parental species. Another potential assembly strategy that can be used when all the parental species are known is the assembly of the genome sequences based on the parental diploid species. This was employed for the allotetraploid Arabidopsis kamchatica using the two parental species A. halleri and A. lyrata;24,25 however, this cannot be simply applied to finger millet because one of the parental species is unknown. Recently, the rubber tree genome was assembled using Dovetail Chicago method26 (Dovetail Genomics, LLC, Santa Cruz, CA, USA) with a scaffold N50 of 96.8 kb, and they revealed the paleotetraploidy of the genome. The Chicago library is a longer range technique than mate-pair library, which is based on chromosome conformation capture sequencing (Hi-C) protocol.27 The barley genome was assembled in chromosome length scale with Hi-C library.28 NRGene Ltd (Ness-Ziona, Israel) has succeeded recently in assembling some crop genomes, e.g. the genome of maize with a very high scaffold N50 of 35.5 Mb, using the DeNovoMAGICTM software (http://nrgene.com/products-technology/denovomagic/).29 They require some PCR-free paired-end libraries and mate-pair libraries for the DeNovoMAGICTM, but the company has not reported its algorithm and strategy in detail.Here, we report the whole-genome draft sequencing and assembly of a tetraploid finger millet, cultivar PR202 (IC: 479099), using a novel polyploid genome assembly workflow. This cultivar was chosen for this work considering the extent of its adaptability. A selection from the Godavari regions of Southern India was chosen for this study based on its resilience to drought and high-temperature stresses. This cultivar is being used as the national check in all of the multilocation yield-evaluation trials performed by the All India Coordinated Small Millets Improvement Project (AICSMIP) (http://millets.res.in/aicrp_small.php).302. Materials and methodsSeeds of finger millet (variety name, PR202; IC number, 479099; the IC number is the indigenous collection number issued by the National Bureau of Plant Genetic Resources, India) that were stocked at the Project Coordinating Unit (Small Millets), University of Agricultural Sciences, GKVK, Bangalore, India) were used for germination. DNA was extracted from young leaves of finger millet plants grown in a plant chamber at 20 °C to 22 °C, 3 weeks later for sequencing and 2 months later for genome scanning. In this section, the methods used for DNA and RNA isolation and preparation of libraries for sequencing are described.2.1. Preparation of DNA libraries for sequencingGood-quality and high-molecular-weight genomic DNA (gDNA) was isolated using a combination of CTAB and Genomic tip 500/G column (Qiagen AG, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) purification method, in accordance with the protocol ‘Preparing Arabidopsis Genomic DNA for Size-Selected ~20 kb SMRTbell™ Libraries’ (http://www.pacb.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Shared-Protocol-Preparing-Arabidopsis-DNA-for-20-kb-SMRTbell-Libraries.pdf). The DNA pellet obtained using the conventional CTAB method was dissolved in 1 ml of Dnase- and RNase-free distilled water (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and purified by passing through Genomic tip 500/G columns, to obtain intact DNA with a size above 60 kb. For library preparation, the TruSeq DNA NanoSample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was used in the following steps. DNA samples (1 µg) were sonicated on a Covaris instrument (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA) using settings specific for a fragment size of 550 bp. The fragmented DNA samples were size selected using AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter, Inc., Brea, CA, USA), end-repaired, and polyadenylated. TruSeq adapters containing the index for multiplexing were ligated to the fragmented DNA samples. Fragments containing TruSeq adapters at both ends were selectively enriched by PCR. The quality and quantity of the enriched libraries were validated using Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies) and TapeStation system (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). The products were a smear with an average fragment size of approximately 700 bp. The libraries were normalized to 10 nM in Tris-HCl 10 mM, pH 8.5 with 0.1% Tween 20. The 3–8 and 20 kb mate-pair libraries were prepared according to Lucigen’s NxSeq® Long Mate Pair Kit protocol and NxSeq® 20 kb Mate Pair Library kit protocol (Lucigen Corporation, Middleton, WI, USA), respectively. Briefly, genomic DNA was sheared using Covaris G-TUBES (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA) to the desired size (3, 5, 8, and 20 kb), end-repaired, A-tailed, and ligated to adaptors. The insert was size selected and ligated to a unique coupler that contained encrypted Chimera Code™ sequences. The circularized inserts were treated with exonuclease for the removal of unwanted linear DNA and digested with a selection of endonucleases to produce correctly sized di-tags (400–900 bp). Biotin capture was used to remove unwanted DNA fragments prior to the addition of the Junction Code™ Reagent. The library was recircularized and PCR amplified and the quality was assessed using a Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies), and the TapeStation system (Agilent, Waldbronn, Germany). The final mate-pair libraries were normalized to 10 nM in Tris–HCl 10 mM, pH 8.5 with 0.1% Tween 20.2.2. Preparation of RNA libraries for sequencingRNA was extracted from young leaves of finger millet 1 month after germination. Freshly germinated finger millet plants were exposed to drought stress, in which the plants were not watered for 7 days. Tissue samples were taken from the young leaves before and after the exposure to drought conditions. RNA was extracted using an RNeasy plant kit (Qiagen AG, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland). The quantity and quality of the isolated RNA was determined using a Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer (Life Technologies) and a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Waldbronn). For library preparation, TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) was used in the subsequent steps. Briefly, total RNA samples (1 µg) were ribosome depleted and then reverse transcribed into double-stranded cDNAs, with addition of actinomycin during first-strand synthesis. The cDNA samples were fragmented, end-repaired, and polyadenylated before the ligation of TruSeq adapters. The adapters contained the index for multiplexing. Fragments containing TruSeq adapters at both ends were selectively enriched with PCR. The quality and quantity of the enriched libraries were assessed using a Qubit® 2.0 Fluorometer and a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent, Waldbronn). Products were a smear with an average fragment size of ~360 bp. The libraries were normalized to 10 nM in Tris-HCl 10 mM, pH 8.5 with 0.1% Tween 20.2.3. Library preparation and sequencing for PacBio RS IIThe SMRT Bell library was produced using a DNA Template Prep Kit 1.0 (PacBio p/n 100-259-100). The concentration of the input gDNA was measured using a Qubit Fluorometer dsDNA Broad Range assay (Life Technologies p/n 32850). gDNA (10 µg) was mechanically sheared to an average size distribution of 10 kb using a Covaris gTube (Kbiosciences p/n 520079). A Bioanalyzer 2100 12K DNA Chip assay (Agilent p/n 5067-1508) was used to assess the fragment size distribution. Sheared gDNA (5 µg) was DNA-damage repaired and end-repaired using polishing enzymes. A blunt-end ligation reaction followed by exonuclease treatment was performed to create the SMRT Bell template. A Blue Pippin device (Sage Science, Inc., Beverly, MA, USA) was used to size select the SMRT Bell template and enrich for large fragments (>10 kbp). The size-selected library was quality inspected and quantified on Agilent Bioanalyzer 12 kb DNA Chip and Qubit Fluorimeter (Life Technologies). A ready-to-sequence SMRT Bell-Polymerase Complex was created using a P6 DNA/Polymerase Binding Kit 2.0 (PacBio p/n 100-236-500), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The PacBio RS II instrument was programmed to load and sequence the sample on PacBio SMRT cells v3.0 (PacBio p/n 100-171-800), acquiring one movie of 360 min per SMRT cell. A MagBead loading (PacBio p/n 100-133-600) method was chosen to improve the enrichment of the longer fragments. After the run, a sequencing report was generated for each cell via the SMRT portal, to assess adapter dimer contamination, sample-loading efficiency, average read length, and number of filtered sub-reads.2.4. Next-generation optical mappingA Bionano Prep™ Plant Tissue DNA Isolation Kit was used according to the Bionano Prep™ Plant Tissue DNA Isolation Base Protocol (Document number: 30068, Document revision: B, Bionano Genomics, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Briefly, 1 g of young leaves collected 2 months after germination was fixed in formaldehyde, to protect the nuclei and DNA against mechanical shearing. The leaves were then homogenized with a rotor-stator apparatus, to break the tough plant cell wall, followed by a density gradient purification for the recovery of intact nuclei. These samples were embedded in low-melt agarose plugs for proteinase K (Qiagen AG, Hombrechtikon, Switzerland) and RNase A (Qiagen AG, Hombrechtikon) digestion and subsequent purification of high-molecular-weight (HMW) DNA. The resulting HMW DNA was processed further according to the IrysPrep™ Labeling-NLRS User Guide (Document number: 30024, Document revision: G, Bionano Genomics) using an NLRS Kit (Bionano Genomics). In brief, 300 ng of HMW DNA was nicked by Nt.BspQI (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA) and labeled. These reactions provided sequence specificity for an optimal label density of 8–15 labels per 100 kbp. The nick enzyme Nt.BspQI was selected by predicting the label density as 11.9 labels per 100 kbp using Bionano Genomics Knickers (ver. 1.5.5.0, http://www.bnxinstall.com/knickers/Knickers.htm) beforehand. The labeled nicks were repaired to restore strand integrity, and the labeled DNA was stained for backbone visualization. Labeled nicks were subsequently detected as dots on a string when run on a Bionano Irys® system instrument.2.5. Sequencing and optical mappingSequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq500, MiSeq instrument (Illumina) and a PacBio RS II system (Pacific Bioscience of California, Inc., CA, USA). Genome optical mapping was carried out on a Bionano Irys® system (Bionano Genomics). The three paired-end libraries with insertion lengths of 250, 550, and 700 bases were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq500 apparatus (reagent version 2 kits 2 × 150 cycles). In contrast, the four mate-pair libraries with insert sizes of 3, 5, 8, and 20 kb were sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq instrument (reagent version 3 kits 2 × 300 cycles). Long reads were obtained from PacBio RS II using a total of 23 SMRT cells. The nicked-labeled HMW DNA was run on a Bionano IrysChip® flowcell that scanned 6 times for 96.5× coverage.2.6. Genome size estimationApproximately 0.5 cm2 of fresh leaf tissue of finger millet, together with an equal amount of leaf tissue of tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum; used as an internal standard [diploid genome size, 1.96 pg31]), was chopped with a sharp razor blade in extraction buffer (CyStain PI Absolut P; Sysmex Europe GmbH, Norderstedt, Germany). The suspension of nuclei was filtrated and incubated in staining solution containing propidium iodide (PI) and RNase A (CyStain PI Absolut P; Sysmex). The suspension of stained nuclei was analyzed using a flow cytometer (CyFlow Space, Sysmex).2.7. Hybrid de novo assembly workflow and gene annotationThe hybrid de novo assembly workflow is shown in Fig. 1. Adapters that contaminated the sequenced paired-end reads and low-quality bases were trimmed using Trimmomatic (ver. 0.33)32 on the SUSHI framework33 after sequencing. Regarding the mate-pair libraries, first, chimera reads were filtered out, and chimera code and linker sequences from the 5' end were trimmed using the script IlluminaChimera-Clean5.py provided by Lucigen Co., Wisconsin, USA, followed by another script, IlluminaNxSeqJunction-Split9.py, to segregate the reads into proper mate-pair reads and unsplit reads via the detection of junction sequences. Subsequently, Platanus (ver. 1.2.4)34 was executed using the preprocessed paired-end reads to assemble contigs (Fig. 1, step 1), which were then used as anchors to connect the PacBio long reads on DBG2OLC (commit id: 7f1712ae76b015b1f4efee81a5d4e1305701197a)35 (Fig. 1, step 2). Contigs from the Platanus assembly that were longer than 1 kb were used for the input of the DBG2OLC hybrid assembly. Note that many short contigs were filtered out to adopt a conservative approach aimed at avoiding misassembly, as short and fragmented contigs stemmed most probably from complex regions, such as repeats and duplicates. The contigs from the DBG2OLC hybrid assembly were polished using Pilon (ver. 1.21)36 with the accurate Illumina short reads, to correct misassemblies (NGS contigs) (Fig. 1, step 3). We used only half amount of the paired-end reads (250 base insert size) for the polishing. Subsequently, the polished contigs were scaffolded with the mate-pairs using SSPACE standard (ver. 3.0)37 (NGS scaffolds) (Fig. 1, step 4-1). We only used the proper mate-pair reads for scaffolding. Independently, optical genome mapping was performed on a Bionano Irys® system (Fig. 1, step 4-2), followed by de novo assembly with the detected molecules using the IrysView® and Bionano IrysSolve® software (ver. 2.1) (BNG contigs) (Fig. 1, step 5). The de novo assembly was performed twice: the first de novo assembly used the estimated nose parameters by mapping the detected molecules to the NGS contigs, and the second assembly used autonoise (autodetection of appropriate noise parameters). The hybrid scaffolding was performed using Bionano IrysSolve® (ver. 2.1) with both the NGS scaffolds and the BNG contigs. Finally, GMclose (ver. 1.6)38 filled the gaps in the super-scaffolds using all the contigs assembled by Platanus. The actual executed commands as a shell script with configuration files and parameters are provided in Supplementary File S1. Hybrid de novo assembly workflow. In the figure, the white box represents a process, the gray box represents a data entity, the blue solid arrow shows the process flow, and the black dashed arrow shows the data flow. The hybrid de novo assembly was executed as follows: (1) contig assembly using only paired-end reads (Platanus ver. 1.2.4), (2) hybrid contig assembly using contigs >1 kb from the first step and long reads (DBG2OLC commit id: 7f1712ae76b015b1f4efee81a5d4e1305701197a), (3) polishing of the assembled contig with paired-end reads (Pilon ver. 1.21) (NGS contigs), (4) using the polished contigs in the two subsequent independent steps, (4-1) scaffolding of the polished contigs with mate-pair reads (NGS scaffolds), (4-2) after converting scanned molecules into a CMAP file and optical genome mapping to the NGS contigs, (5) de novo assembly of scanned molecules based on the parameters of the molecular-quality report and autonoise (autodetection of appropriate noise parameters) with the NGS contigs (BNG contigs), (6) hybrid scaffolding with both NGS scaffolds (step 4-1 output) and BNG contigs (step 5 output), and (7) gap closing (GMclose ver. 1.6) of the scaffolds with all the contigs generated in the first step (step 1 output). Finally, the workflow produced the super scaffolds. The raw data preprocesses, such as adapter trimming and removing chimera code from mate-pair reads, are not shown in this workflow.Hybrid de novo assembly workflow.

Finally, the workflow produced the super scaffolds. The raw data preprocesses, such as adapter trimming and removing chimera code from mate-pair reads, are not shown in this workflow.The genes were predicted and annotated using MAKER (ver. 2.31.8)39 based on the rice genome (Oryza sativa ssp. japonica IRGSP-1.0, ENA Assembly: GCA_001433935.1) and the RNAseq data that were obtained from young leaves. The rice cDNAs and RNAseq data for the EST evidence and the rice proteins for the protein homology evidence were used for the MAKER job. To render the GFF file, the input of MAKER, the RNAseq data were mapped to the assembled reference sequences using STAR aligner (ver. 2.5.2b)40 and the GFF annotation file was constructed via transcriptome construction using StringTie (ver. 1.3.3b).41 The rice-specific repeat-making library obtained from Repbase database42 was used for RepeatMasker (ver. 4.0.5).43 The rice model was used for Augustus (ver. 3.2.0)44 gene prediction in the MAKER pipeline. The detail options are written in the Supplementary File S1. For assessing the quality of the genome assembly and annotation, we executed BUSCO (ver. 2.0.1)45 using the published plant universal single-copy orthologs. We also performed an RNAseq data alignment to the final assembled genome using STAR (ver. 2.5.2b)40 and checked the mapping statistics.3. Results and discussionIn this section, we report the genome assembly and discuss the results of its validation.3.1. Sequencing and assembly statisticsUsing the flow cytometry experiment, we estimated that the size of the finger millet genome is 1.5 Gb. In total, short reads amounting to 140× coverage and long reads amounting to 16× coverage were sequenced. We scanned the DNA molecules on a Bionano Irys® system and detected 144,761 Mb molecules in a total of six runs (Supplementary Table S1). Based on the estimated genome size, the sequenced coverage depth for each library is reported in Table 1 (PacBio subreads length distribution and calculated insert size of distribution are shown in Supplementary Figs S1 and S2, respectively). Raw sequence dataThe number of sequenced raw data in each library and the coverage depth based on the genome size, 1.5 Gb as estimated by flow cytometry, are shown.Raw sequence dataThe number of sequenced raw data in each library and the coverage depth based on the genome size, 1.5 Gb as estimated by flow cytometry, are shown.The statistics of each step in the hybrid assembly are shown in Table 2. The total assembled size was 1,188,784,944 bases, which is 78.2% of the genome size estimated by flow cytometry. The hybrid contig assembly by DBG2OLC and the scaffolding by SSPACE enhanced the continuity from the Platanus contig assembly, although the mate-pair sequenced coverage was less than 10×, and the total assembly size decreased compared with the Platanus contig assembly. This could be explained by the low sequencing coverage of the PacBio long reads, rather than the filtering out of the shorter Platanus contigs. At the final hybrid scaffolding and gap closing, the N50 of the final super-scaffolds increased to 2.68 Mb, which is approximately twice as long as the NGS scaffolds. The hybrid scaffolding generated super-scaffolds that concatenated the NGS scaffolds based on the BNG contigs that were assembled from the optical genome mapping. Some conflicts were detected between NGS scaffolds and BNG contigs, which split the conflicting NGS scaffolds into smaller pieces. This had the major advantage of correcting the polyploid genome assembly, as scaffolding with only mate-pair short reads may fail to solve the long-range homeologous complexity and may sometimes lead to mis-scaffolding.46,47Assembly statistics at each assembly stepAssembly statistics at each step are summarized. Contig assembly represents the contigs that were assembled using Platanus with preprocessed paired-end reads. Hybrid assembly represents the contigs that were generated using DBG2OLC with the Platanus contigs (> 1 kb long) and PacBio long reads. Scaffold is the result of the SSPACE standard scaffolding with mate-pair reads, and Hybrid scaffold is the hybrid scaffolding result with both Bionano Genomics de novo assembled contigs and the SSPACE scaffolds, followed by GMclose gap closing.Assembly statistics at each assembly stepAssembly statistics at each step are summarized.

Some assemblers, such as Platanus,34 solve this problem by using multiple k-mer sizes for the construction of the DBG. As another solution for the homeologous complexity, longer reads produced from a single-molecule sequencer combined with the OLC method may be beneficial. However, high-coverage sequencing of long reads may solve and correct the wrongly sequenced bases, albeit at a high cost. The hybrid de novo assembly described in this article, which uses both accurate short reads and inaccurate long reads with a low coverage depth, represents another solution regarding assembly cost and calculation efficiency; moreover, the beneficial feature of long reads can be applied to solve the homeologous complexity encountered during polyploid genome assembly. The classification of reads via homeolog phasing50 based on long reads or the parental diploid genome may improve the polyploid assembly further. In addition, further longer molecule information from such as Bionano Irys® system is very promising, not only for super-scaffolding, but also for solving the long-range homeologous complexity in polyploid genome assembly, as demonstrated by the results reported in this article.3.2. Gene annotation and assembly validationAfter the hybrid assembly, we conducted gene annotation prediction using MAKER and 62,348 genes were predicted. The distribution of Annotation Edit Distance (AED)39 tagged by MAKER is shown in Fig. 2A, in which more than 91% of the annotated genes (57,066 genes among a total of 62,348 genes) show an AED <0.5. This result indicates that the annotation is well supported by the evidence. For the assessment of the quality of the assembly and annotation, the assembled scaffolds and predicted genes were analyzed on BUSCO (Fig. 2B). In the assembled scaffolds (shown in Fig. 2B, ‘genome’), 96.5% of the universal single-copy genes (1,389 genes among a total of 1,440 genes) were identified, supporting the quality of the assembly. Among the 1,389 single-copy genes detected, 606 genes were detected as being complete single-copy genes, 783 genes were found to be duplicates, and 766 of the 783 duplicates were exactly twice found from two different scaffolds. An NCBI BLAST search of the complete single-copy genes (606) that were detected only once in the assembled genome found an additional 556 homologous partial genes with a shorter alignment length (40% of the 1,389 complete single-copy genes detected). This indicates that the majority of the homeologous genes were assembled separately (see section 3.3). In tetraploid species, two copies may be found for each ‘single-copy gene’, although duplicated genes may be gradually lost because of redundancy (called nonfunctionalization or homeolog loss).51,52 Similar results were obtained from the BUSCO analysis of proteins and transcripts (Fig. 2, ‘proteins’ and ‘transcripts’), but the missing and fragmented proportion was increased compared with the ‘genome’ analysis. It is well known that one of the homeologs may not be expressed (or silenced) after polyploidization, because of redundancy; thus, some genes were not annotated and the missing and fragmented proportion increased among transcripts and proteins because of the lack of evidence. Moreover, we searched the predicted proteins in the Pfam database53 and found that 74% of predicted proteins were present in this database (Supplementary Fig. S3). RNAseq data obtained using other tissues and conditions may improve the gene annotation process. Annotation edit distance (AED) and benchmark of universal single-copy orthologs. (A) The distribution of AED tagged as a gene by MAKER. (B) Benchmark result of the plant set of universal single-copy orthologs produced by BUSCO.

Polyploid assembly validation and phylogenetic analysisTo validate the quality of the polyploid assembly, i.e. to determine whether the homeologs were assembled in different scaffolds, we analyzed our assembly data of three genes for which Sanger sequencing data of E. coracana had been already reported. First, we performed an NCBI BLAST (ver. 2.2.31+)54 search of the published low-copy-number marker phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase 4 (Pepc4)1 and granule-bound starch synthase I-like (waxy)2 in the assembled scaffolds. The reciprocal BLAST best-hit search with a very low E-value threshold identified exactly two scaffolds with two different completely matching sequences from different clades (the NCBI BLAST search result is shown in Supplementary File S2). Second, we conducted a molecular phylogenetic analysis using MEGA4 (ver. 7.0.26)55 based on the detected low-copy-number homeologs with the published sequences of close relatives1 (Supplementary Fig. S4). As shown in these figures, the homeologs detected were clearly separated in different clusters. This result indicates that, in these gene regions, the homeologs were successfully assembled, regardless of the presence of highly homologous base sequences. Moreover, the trees supported the contention that E. indica is the wild diploid progenitor of the A genome, because one of the homeologs clustered with the sequences of E. indica.Next, we analyzed EcNAC1, which is the best-studied gene of E. coracana related to the drought response.10 NAC is one of the largest families of plant-specific transcription factors and has been shown to be involved in diverse processes, such as growth, development, and abiotic stresses. The EcNAC1 of the E. coracana GPU28 variety was induced by drought stresses and conferred tolerance to various abiotic stresses, such as simulated osmotic stress by polyethylene glycol (PEG) and mannitol and salinity stresses in the overexpression lines of tobacco.10 Based on our assembly of PR202, we found a sequence that was similar to, and clustered with, the EcNAC1 of GPU28, together with another sequence from the Trichy1 variety (GenBank accession ID: KU500625.1) (Supplementary Fig. S5). The assembly also had another copy, which is likely to be a homeolog in a different scaffold. It would be valuable to study this copy, which may well have drought-related functions.In addition, we searched homologous genes as ‘duplicated genes’ in the predicted transcripts using NCBI BLAST and found 57,913 genes that had more than two copies in the genome (Supplementary File S3). Among these duplicates, we found 34,678 genes as reciprocal BLAST best-hit genes located in different scaffolds. Assuming that these genes are homeologs, we found that 56% of all 62,348 genes were considered homeologs, which is consistent with the ratio (55% (766/1389)) of duplicated single-copy genes detected exactly twice in BUSCO (the analytical process and results are shown as a shell script in Supplementary File S3). To check the location of these homeologs, we calculated the gene density (the number of genes per Mb) and the homeolog density (the number of homeologs per Mb) in each scaffold (Supplementary Fig. S6 A1–2, B1–2). Panels A1 and B1 of Supplementary Fig. S6 show the density against the scaffold length of all genes and homeologs, respectively, and panels A2 and B2 show the density distribution of all genes and homeologs, respectively, as well. The genome-wide gene density was 52.4 genes per Mb and the genome-wide homeolog density was 29.2 homeologs per Mb. As shown in these figures, all genes and homeologs were distributed similarly over the genome. Nonetheless, there was a small number of scaffolds (>1 kb long) with high homeolog density (Supplementary Fig. S6, B1), which indicates that there are areas that are dense in homeologs compared with the genome-wide homeolog distribution.3.4. Summary of the assembly of the genome of polyploid finger milletOver half of the world’s freshwater resources are currently being used for irrigating agricultural crops. The domestic and industrial demands of the burgeoning population have led to an unprecedented withdrawal of freshwater.56 Combined with the erratic pattern of rainfall caused by the ensuing global climate change, agriculture production is expected to be severely affected in the years to come.57 This scenario urgently necessitates the cultivation of more water-productive crops and/or the development of improved cultivars with a superior water-use efficiency. Millets, with their C4 photosynthetic metabolism, are generally considered to possess higher levels of drought tolerance and are generally cultivated under rain-fed conditions. Because of their higher resilience to harsh climatic conditions, millets exhibit a wider adaptation, and hence can be cultivated in a wider range of agro-ecosystems. Therefore, millets currently represent an integral component of human diets in most impoverished areas, especially in the tropical and subtropical regions of Africa and Southeast Asia.We assembled the genome of the allotetraploid finger millet (Eleusine coracana (L.) Gaertn, variety: PR202, IC: 479099) via a novel pipeline using various types of sequencers. The size of the assembled genome was about 1.2 Gb, while the genome size measured by flow cytometry was 1.5 Gb. Considering that the majority of the grass genomes are likely to be composed of repetitive elements, the coverage of the genome is sufficiently high. MAKER predicted 62,348 genes, which is roughly the double of the 35,679 genes identified in diploid rice (Oryza sativa Japonica IRGSP-1.0); this is also consistent with a good coverage of the genome. Three lines of evidence supported the good coverage. First, we provided a polyploid assembly with a long scaffold size (N50 length >2.5 Mb), while the assembly of polyploid genomes tends to be fragmented. It is true that the N50 may not mean correct assembly and scaffolding, but we avoided too-greedy scaffolding. Second, 96.5% of the 1,440 universal single-copy orthologs were identified, and 95.9% of RNAseq reads were mapped to the assembled genome, which supported the adequateness of the assembly. Third, the majority of these universal sets had two copies, suggesting the separation of homeologs was adequate in our assembly strategy. Concomitantly, however, we found a significant number of genes that had a single copy. There are several likely explanations for this finding. (i) One of the duplicated genes tends to be lost because of redundancy. Polyploidization was estimated to have occurred well before the domestication of millet (0.50–2.71 mya), in contrast with other crops, in which polyploidization occurred through domestication during the last thousand years.58,59 Thus, it is possible that many duplicated genes were lost. (ii) The published plant universal single-copy gene set is not collected by random sampling from the entire plant genes in terms of the rate of gene loss. Despite the frequent occurrence of genome duplication events throughout angiosperms, these genes tend to be lost and become single copy, potentially because of dosage balance or redundancy. (iii) The assembly size is less than the genome size estimated by flow cytometry. Most of the lacking sequences are likely to be repetitive sequences, but it is also likely that parts of the genic regions were not assembled. (iv) The assembler could not deal with two homeologs; thus, one copy was missing or two copies were combined. We verified that the two copies of the Pepc4 gene, waxy and NAC, were assembled separately. Currently, not many genome sequences from diploid E. indica are available, preventing the systematic validation of homeologs. Further improvement of assembly algorithms and validation would be valuable in this field of research. It is still possible to improve the assembly and annotation of this genome. Nevertheless, the allotetraploid finger millet genome information reported here is expected to be of much value for further genomic research of this millet at the molecular level, as well as for studies aimed at improving finger millet productivity and bioavailability. We have successfully shown the applicability of the multiple hybrid de novo assembly workflow to a complex allotetraploid genome.Recently, the genome assembly of the E. coracana ML-365 variety was elucidated using Illumina and SOLiD sequencing data.60 We emphasize that our data and analyses were targeted at the analysis of complex polyploid genomes. The N50 of our assembly (>2.5 Mb) was two orders of magnitude higher than that of ML-365 (about 24 kb) and would allow RNAseq analysis of each homeolog separately, as well as resequencing analyses. Our results illustrate the strength of single-molecule sequencing and optical genome mapping in assembling polyploid genomes.We wish to thank Dr. Scott Monsma at Lucigen Co., Wisconsin, USA, for mate-pair library preparation, Carmen Näf at the University of Zurich for RNA extraction and library preparation, Aki Morishima for plant growth and genome size estimation by flow cytometry, Dr. Misako Yamazaki and Dr. Lucas Mohn at the University of Zurich for sample handling, and Dr. Dario Copetti at the University of Arizona for advice on gene annotation, and Dr. Jun Sese and Dr. Tony Kuo at the National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology for discussion about polyploid genome assembly.

IntroductionEmbryonic lethality has become a challenge to cattle breeders, especially for dairy cattle where a limited number of bulls were extensively used in breeding for fast genetic progress in economic traits like milk and protein yield.1 An estimated yearly loss of ~$10.74 million is attributed to known recessive lethals in four dairy cattle breeds from USA only, where Holstein accounts for ~70% of the total losses, followed by Jersey, Brown Swiss, and Ayrshire.2 Hence, understanding the genomic architecture of cattle populations is important, now more than ever, for optimizing genetic gain while constraining negative impact of deleterious mutations responsible for genetic defects and inbreeding depression.Unlike single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and small insertion or deletion (indel), structural variants (SVs), i.e. DNA alterations larger than 50 base pairs (bp) that include insertions, deletions, duplications, inversions, and translocations,3 are the least explored polymorphisms in cattle. SVs contribute substantially to phenotypic variations and have a wide-spectrum of impact ranging from beneficial to lethal in both humans3,4 and animals.5 The phenotypic impact of SVs in cattle is well evident from numerous studies. For example, Xu et al.6 showed that a combination of SNPs with SVs could explain additional genetic variance underlying milk production traits, while Charlier et al.,7 Schutz et al.,8 and Kadri et al.,9 showed the lethal effect of large deletions in dairy cattle. Furthermore, a ~525 KB deletion on chromosome 23 is reported to be associated with stillbirth in Nordic Red Cattle.10Earlier SV studies on cattle were mostly SNP-array based, such as array-comparative genomic hybridization,11 50 K BovineSNP50 BeadChip12 or 777 K BovineHD BeadChip (BovineHD chip)13 based. But, using these approaches a substantial portion of the genome could not be explored and breakpoint resolution is still an issue.14 However, whole-genome sequence (WGS) based techniques could improve resolution as well as power to capture SVs in a wide size and frequency spectrum.14 For example, majority of the novel SVs in humans15,16 and mouse17 were detected using WGS approaches. Besides, breakpoint sequences could also be assembled with high accuracy from sequencing reads,18 which are necessary for elucidating the mechanisms underlying SV formation.19In the advent of next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, hundreds of cattle (bull or cow) genomes were re-sequenced in collaborative initiative such as 1000 Bull Genomes Project (1KBGP)20 (and other independent projects, e.g.21,22) to build a comprehensive database of sequence variants, mainly SNPs and indels. This NGS data provides a unique opportunity to study SVs in cattle. However, few studies23,24 utilized these (and/or other) NGS resources so far for studying SVs in cattle.Therefore, in this study we scanned the WGSs of 175 cattle from three dairy breeds, namely Holstein, Jersey, and Nordic Red Cattle, to discover large deletions segregating in the population, and analyse their population-genetic properties. In particular, we focused on understating the population diversity, stratification, and plausible functional effects. We also explored the probable mechanisms of SV formation for a set of breakpoint-resolved deletions.2. Materials and methods2.1. Animal samples and ethicsThis study was performed on WGS of 175 dairy cattle from three breeds, e.g. 67 Holstein, 27 Jersey, and 81 Nordic Red Cattle. The sample included 7 Holstein cows and 168 bulls from these three breeds-144 animals from Run 5 of 1KBGP20 and 31 animals from Nordic sequence data.21 Genome sequences were generated using Illumina paired-end sequencing to an average coverage of 10-fold.Here, we did not include any experimentation on animals and only dealt with analysis-ready WGS data; hence, no ethical approval was required.2.2. Sequence alignment to reference genome and SNPs/indels callingRaw sequencing reads were filtered and ‘FASTQ’ files were aligned to bovine reference genome assembly ‘UMD3.1’ using ‘BWA’ software25 to produce BAM files for subsequent variant calling. In 1KBGP, SNPs and indels were called using ‘SAMtools 0.1.18 mpileup’ software,26 while ‘GATK v1.6’ software27 was used for Nordic WGS data (detailed method in20 and,21 respectively). For all the analysis, bovine genome assembly ‘UMD3.1’ was used as the reference genome. 2.3. Discovery and genotyping of deletionsSVs can be detected from NGS data based on sequence signatures such as (discordant) read-pair (RP), split-read (SP), and read-depth (RD), as well as de novo assembly of reads.14 However, approaches based on only one sequence signature could be constrained by high false discovery rate (FDR),28 hence we employed a population scale SV detection method called ‘Genome STRucture in Populations (Genome STRiP)’28—which leverages technical (e.g. RP and RD signals) and population-level sequence features (e.g. coherence around shared alleles, and heterogeneity of evidentiary sequences in different genomes) for accurate discovery of deletions, and determines genotype (allelic state) of each locus from RD using a Gaussian mixture model.For deletion discovery and genotyping ‘Genome STRiP’ software version 2.00.167828 was used. Following the documentation, we built a custom reference metadata bundle for cattle samples that includes alignability mask, copy-number mask (CN2 mask), ploidy map, gender map. Alignability mask represents sites on the reference genome that are uniquely alignable by sequence read of a certain length (readLength). Our WGS data was a mixture of different ‘Illumina’ paired-end reads ranging from 90 to 101 bp (Q1 = 90, median = 100, and Q3 = 100), hence genome alignability mask was prepared with readLength value of 90 using ‘ComputeGenomeMask’ utility from Genome STRiP. Copy-number mask (CN2 mask), i.e. regions on the reference genome unlikely to be copy-number variable in most individuals, was produced for the bovine assembly UMD3.1 excluding sex chromosome X, unplaced contigs, and repeat sequences (retrieved from RepeatMasker track of UCSC Table Browser,29 accessed on 4 July 2016).We ran the preprocessing Queue script (dry run) to emit all the commands, prepared bash scripts to run in Portable Batch System job scheduler, and executed these commands proving 175 BAM files (one for each sample) as input.Large deletions (100 bp = size = 1 MB) were discovered and filtered using SVDiscovery Queue script. Discovered sites were filtered (default filters) if (i) the site contained too high or too low read pileup, (ii) RPs spacing was inconsistent with a single segregating deletion, (iii) RD and RP evidences were inconsistent across samples, (iv) RD differences were not significant, and (v) RP evidence was thinly distributed across samples (Genome STRiP Tutorial—GATK Workshop 2013, http://software.broadinstitute.org/software/genomestrip/workshop-presentations, accessed on 26 August 2016).All passed sites were genotyped by SVGenotyper with default parameters. Genotyped deletion calls were then filtered based on following criteria, e.g. (i) sites with excess number of heterozygote calls (inbreeding coefficient = -0.15), (ii) non-variant site based on genotype likelihood (parameter: non-variance score = 13.0), (iii) sites with too low or too high RD (parameter: 0.5 = GSM1 = 2.0), (iv) sites with less than 30% uniquely alignable bases, (v) potential duplicate of another site (parameter: duplicateOverlapThreshold 0.5 and duplicateScoreThreshold = 0.0), (vi) start/end position of a deletion call within 150 bp of assembly gap, (vii) all samples homozygous for reference allele (95% CI), and (viii) sites with = 10% missing genotype.2.4. Validation of deletionsWe validated deletion calls using 777K BovineHD BeadChip (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) intensity data on 26 Holstein samples that were both WGS and 777K chip typed. We calculated FDR for the deletion call-set using IntensityRankSum (IRS) test implemented in Genome STRiP. Intensity file was prepared from raw chip intensity data following the guideline for IRS test. Overall FDR for the call-set was calculated as two times the fraction of sites with IRS P-value = 0.5 (i.e. sites with IRS P-value = 0.5 to the sites with valid P-value). Details of IRS test could be found in.15,28Targeted iterative graph routing assembler (TIGRA-0.4.3) software18 was used, with default parameters, for assembling deletion breakpoint sequences from a set of randomly selected deletions along with three previously known deletions segregating in the study populations. TIGRA extracted all reads mapped to 500 bp upstream and 50 bp downstream of start coordinate, and 50 bp upstream and 500 bp downstream of end coordinate of a given deletion; and reads were then assembled iteratively using de Bruijn graph assembler with multiple k-mers (e.g. 15 bp followed by 25 bp). We aligned the assembled contigs to UMD3.1 using Cow BLAT Search30 from UCSC Genome Browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat) to visualize and infer breakpoints from the alignments.We validated a previously reported ~525 KB deletion segregating in Nordic Red Cattle10 using PCR and amplicon sequencing. Genomic DNA was extracted as described previously by Miller et al.31 from semen sample of two bulls carrying the deletion and two non-carriers. The PCR reaction was done with the DyNAzyme II DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher, MA, US) in a 30 µl volume of 1× PCR buffer, 0.2 mM dNTPs, 10 pmol primer mix (forward primer: 5'- AAGCCACCACAATGAGAAGC -3' and reverse primer: 5'- TTTGGGGTAGGAGAAGTAGGG -3') and 50 ng of genomic DNA. The cycling conditions were the following: (i) an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min, (ii) 35 cycles of 30 s denaturation (94 °C), 30 s hybridization (65.2 °C), 30 s elongation (72 °C), and a final 3 min elongation (72 °C). PCR products were separated on a 2% agarose gel, purified and directly sequenced using the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems, CA, US). Electrophoresis of sequencing reactions was performed on ‘3500xL Genetic Analyzers’ (Applied Biosystems, CA, US), and sequences were visualized with Sequencher 5.4.6 (Gene Codes Corporation, MI, USA). A 977 bp control amplification, with a primer pair within the deletion (forward primer: 5'- CCCAATGCAAAATCACAAAA -3' and reverse primer: 5'- CCAGAAAAGCTACACTTGAACTGA -3'), was performed using the same reaction conditions as above except hybridization was performed at 59.8 °C.2.5. Analysis of population genetic propertiesThe population genetic properties of deletions, among the three breeds, were studied in terms of population diversity, population structure, and population differentiation. Population diversity was calculated using ‘VariantsPerSampleAnnotator’ from ‘Genome STRiP’ software, which provides distribution of variants across samples and populations. We performed principal component analysis (PCA) using PLINK (v1.90p) software32 to distinguish three cattle breeds (details in Supplementary Material). We calculated VST33—a population stratification measure of SVs (highly correlated with Wright’s fixation index, FST34), for each deletion locus using variant allele frequency (VAF) and genotypes from pairwise comparison of one breed with the rest, such as Holstein vs Jersey + Nordic Red Cattle, and vice versa.2.6. Functional annotation and enrichment analysisFunctional annotation of deletions were performed using ‘Variant Effect Predictor (VEP-87)’ software,35 and enrichment of protein domains (InterPro36 and Pfam37) and pathways (KEGG38) were analysed using ‘STRING-v10 database’.39Selective constraints on genes were measured from the ratio of non-synonymous (dN) to synonymous (dS) substitution rate, i.e. dN/dS ratio, between cow-mouse 1-to-1 orthologues downloaded from Ensembl database40 (release 87, last accessed on 21 February 2017) using BioMart.41 Here we analysed whether dN/dS of genes overlapping deletions are higher (i.e. less constrained) than that of mouse lethal genes (from Dickinson et al.42) using Wilcoxson test. Reported causal genes for cattle were also retrieved from OMIA database (http://omia.angis.org.au/, last accessed on 10 May 2016) for dN/dS comparison.We retrieved cattle quantitative trait loci (QTL) from QTLdb database43 (release 31; accessed on 6 January 2017); autosomal QTL from Holstein, Jersey, Nordic Red Cattle and Ayrshire, associated to any of the six trait classes, e.g. ‘Reproduction’, ‘Milk’, ‘Production’, ‘Exterior’, ‘Meat and Carcass’, and ‘Health’, were considered for QTL enrichment analysis. We calculated fold enrichment for a trait, such as for Health related QTL: (No. of Health QTL on Deletions / Total QTL on deletions) / (Total Health QTL / Total QTL in the dataset), and statistical significance using ‘Fisher’s exact test’ (two sided).2.7. Data manipulation, visualization, and statistical analysisAll statistical analyses and plots were generated in RStudio software44 running R software version 3.3.2,45 unless mentioned otherwise. BEDTools (v2.26.0) software46 is used for identifying the overlap between deletion calls and other genomic features, such as, ‘UMD3.1’ assembly gaps (from ‘UCSC Table Browser’), CNVs from dbVar database47, three known deletions from7,9,10, QTL from QTLdb. VCFtools (v0.1.15) software and PLINK (v1.90p) software were used for analysing the VCF file.3. Results and discussion3.1. Discovery and genotyping of deletionsDeletion discovery and genotyping were carried out using Genome STRiP. After filtering, we report 8,480 large deletions with genotypes in 67 Holsten, 27 Jersey, and 81 Nordic Red Cattle. The deletion size ranged from 199 bp to 773 KB with a mean of 4.5 KB (median = 1 KB), which is approximately 10 times smaller compared with 184 deletion-CNVs (mean = 44.5 KB, median = 7.7 KB) reported in a recent 777K BovineHD BeadChip (BovineHD chip) based study,13 reflecting the resolution of our sequence-based calls. Only 18% of the deletion calls have overlap (=1 bp) with previously reported bovine deletions (or CNV-loss) in the dbVar database (accessed on 27 January 2017), while remaining 82% are novel. However, ~72% of our deletion regions remained unique when compared with all CNVs (gain or loss) and copy number variable regions in the database. Interestingly, majority (~80%) of these overlapping regions are from an earlier WGS-based study, where genome sequences of 27 Holstein, 17 Montbéliarde, and 18 Normande bulls were analysed.23 Nonetheless, we were able to broaden the accessible deletion size-range, more importantly towards smaller one unascertainable by usual SNP-array based approaches. We also report high quality genotypes for all the 8,480 deletions. Apparently, there are more low frequency variants than that of high frequency one, and the frequency distribution is very similar to humans16 (Fig. 1). Number of ascertained deletions relative to variant allele count. Here, VAF is expressed in terms of variant allele count. Deletions down to an allele count of 1 (VAF = 0.0026 and 0.0032, in cattle and humans, respectively) are also represented here.

It is known from human studies that majority of the (bi-allelic) common SVs segregate on specific SNP haplotypes,48,49 which could be imputed with high accuracy.28,50 Thus, this approach has the potential, albeit with large reference, for accurate haplotype phasing and imputation of SVs to large cohorts of low-density chip-typed animals with no additional cost.3.2. Validation of deletionsWe validated the results using three approaches: (i) using BovineHD chip intensity data, (ii) breakpoint assembly and alignment, and (iii) PCR + sequencing of amplicons.We used 777K BovineHD chip intensity data of 26 Holstein animals, both chip-typed and sequenced, to validate the deletion calls using Genome STRiP’ IRS test. We had partial power to investigate all deletions due to the sparsity of the array-probes (one probe per ~3.5 KB), and were underpowered to accurately verify small deletions (e.g. overlapping one-probe). Furthermore, we could only test a deletion for which at least one of the 26 samples had non-reference allele. Therefore, an estimate of FDR for the deletion call-set is provided here from the overall P-value distribution. In this approach, we were able to interrogate ~8.3% of the total call, majority of which contain a single array-probe within the region (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). We found that deletions overlapping only one array-probe had higher FDR (11.3%) compared with two or more probes. And finally, we showed that our deletion call-set had an overall FDR of 8.8%, which is within our chosen threshold of FDR = 10%. FDR estimates of Genome STRiP’ deletion calls using 777K BovineHD BeadChip intensity dataaA, No. of sites with P-value.bB, No. of sites with P-value = 0.5cFDR estimates were based on ‘Wilcoxson rank sum test’ using BovineHD chip intensity data of 26 Holstein animals. FDR was calculated as (B/A × 2 × 100).FDR estimates of Genome STRiP’ deletion calls using 777K BovineHD BeadChip intensity dataaA, No. of sites with P-value.bB, No. of sites with P-value = 0.5cFDR estimates were based on ‘Wilcoxson rank sum test’ using BovineHD chip intensity data of 26 Holstein animals. FDR was calculated as (B/A × 2 × 100).We next validated three randomly chosen set of ten-deletions each by assembling breakpoint sequences using TIGRA18: 10 deletions = 500 bp, 10 deletions > 500 bp but = 1 KB, and 10 deletions with VAF = 0.10. Out of the thirty, we successfully resolved breakpoints of 26 deletions (~87% success rate) using a combination of TIGRA and BLAT search30 (Supplementary Table S2). Additionally, we assembled breakpoints of three previously reported deletions that were also segregating in our study populations, such as a ~662 KB deletion on chromosome 12 encompassing RNASEH2B, GUCY1B2, and FAM124A, a ~3 KB deletion on chromosome 21 encompassing FANCI, and a ~525 KB deletion on chromosome 23 encompassing BTBD9, GLO1, and DNAH8. Breakpoints of the former two deletions were previously reported in,7,9 which exactly matched with our predicted breakpoint sequences (Supplementary Figs S1a–c and S2a–c). Although for the later, we resolved breakpoint sequences in this study (Fig. 2a and b). Overall, the success rate of our deletion-breakpoint assembly was better than the reported success rate of TIGRA on similar sized read-length.18 And Genome STRiP’s breakpoint predictions were on average within 20 bp of the validated breakpoint, which is within the tool’s reported estimate of 1–20 bp.28A ~525-KB deletion on chromosome 23 discovered using Genome STRiP (a), and resolved breakpoint sequences from TIGRA and BLAT search (b).

The breakpoint spanning PCR products of 359 bp were only observed in the carrier animals, while no amplicon was seen for non-carriers (Fig. 3a). The 359 bp amplicon was then sequenced, and exact breakpoint sequences were observed (Fig. 3b), thus confirming the breakpoint for this deletion.

Population genetic properties of deletionsWe explored population diversity among the three dairy cattle breeds from per-individual deletion-heterozygosity and homozygosity. We found that individuals from Nordic Red Cattle exhibits 3.5 and 6.4% higher deletion-heterozygosity than in Holstein and Jersey, respectively. Median numbers of heterozygote-deletion were 1,272, 1,229 and 1,196, in Nordic Red Cattle, Holstein, and Jersey, respectively (Fig. 4a). In contrast to heterozygosity, Jersey animals showed highest levels of deletion-homozygosity, followed by Holstein (Fig. 4b). Similar estimates of genetic diversity were also reported for these breeds in a SNP heterozygosity and runs-of-homozygosity analysis—where Jersey exhibited lowest (genome-wide) average nucleotide diversity (and higher number/size of runs-of-homozygosity) followed by Holstein and Nordic Red Cattle.51 These differences could be understood from the current effective population size (Ne) of these breeds, e.g. Ne of Jersey, Holstein, and Nordic Red Cattle are 73, 99, and 106, respectively52; this entailed higher diversity in Nordic Red Cattle, and Holstein, than in Jersey. From singletons estimate it is also evident that Nordic Red Cattle has more rare deletions compared with Holstein and Jersey (Fig. 4c); partly could be due to incorrect ascertainment of rare ones.

HOL, Holstein; JER, Jersey; RDC, Nordic Red Cattle.We performed PCA using the deletion genotypes of the samples. Around 6 K deletions with VAF between 0.02 and 0.90 were used in the analysis. For comparison, we also performed PCA on ~168 K bi-allelic SNPs randomly selected from 29 autosomes of the same individuals. The first two principal components (PCs) from both deletion and SNP-based PCA clearly distinguished the three breeds, and jointly explained 20 and 16.2% of the variance, respectively (Fig. 5a and b). In addition, PC3 and PC4 recapitulated substructures within Nordic Red cattle (Supplementary Fig. S3), and first five PCs cumulatively explained 33.6% (with the deletions) and 28.4% (with the SNPs) of the variance (Supplementary Fig. S4). Our deletion results agree with the known population structure of the three breeds. Similar population structure (and substructure within Nordic Red Cattle) has been reported using genome-wide SNPs.53 Nordic Red Cattle from Denmark showed closer relationship with the Holstein in our WGS samples (Supplementary Fig. S5). This is consistent with the known history of Holstein interrogation in Danish Red cattle, as previously reported based on imputed WGS SNP analysis on a larger sample.53 It is also known from admixture analysis that genomes of Nordic Red Cattle are a mosaic of multiple ancestral populations, i.e. more ancestral components in Nordic Red Cattle than in Holstein and Jersey52,54; our deletion-based PCA largely corroborate that.

HOL, Holstein; JER, Jersey; RDC, Nordic Red Cattle.We analysed population stratification in terms of VST,33 a measure highly correlated with Wright’s fixation index (FST),34 to identify population differentiation. We calculated VST for each deletion pairwise amongst the breeds (e.g. Holstein vs Jersey + Nordic Red Cattle) from VAFs. We identified 158 highly stratified deletions (pairwise VST = mean + 4 s.d.) among the breeds (Fig. 6). Around 27% of these deletions overlap genic elements, i.e. exons, introns, or (upstream/downstream) untranslated regions (UTRs), and remaining 73% are intergenic variants (Supplementary Tables S3–S5). There were eleven sites shared between Holstein and Nordic Red Cattle, two sites between Holstein and Jersey, and one site between Nordic Red Cattle and Jersey. Among these sites were gene variants, such as ABCA12 (Chr2:103,682,772-103,684,297 in Holstein & Jersey) associated with growth and development,55,56,TTC1 (Chr7:73,725,513-73,725,918 in Holstein & Nordic Red Cattle) with cold tolerance,57,VWA3B (Chr11:3,521,329-3,522,551 in Holstein & Nordic Red Cattle) with milk glycosylated kappa-casein percentage,58 and were intergenic variants, such as Chr15:41,393,393-41,393,780 (in Jersey and Nordic Red Cattle) and Chr20:26,812,159-26,812,834 (in Holstein and Jersey) overlap QTL associated with calving traits,59,60 Chr20:45,816,245-45,820,519 (in Holstein & Nordic Red Cattle) with meat and carcass trait,61 and Chr23:49,778,653-49,782,567 (in Holstein and Nordic Red Cattle) with body weight.62 We also identified a highly differentiated fertility associated gene DST/BPAG163,64 (Chr23:3,486,232-3,486,603) in Nordic Red Cattle. One differentially selected deletion (VST = 0.28) of chromosome 3 (Chr3:12,141,822-12,170,916) overlapping ENSBTAG00000047776 and ENSBTAG00000024960 genes (human orthologue CD1D), drawn our attention (though it marginally failed our selection threshold); Holsteins exhibited VAF of 24.63% (have both homozygous and heterozygous deletion), while it is mostly homozygous for the reference allele in Nordic Red cattle (VAF = 0.62%) and Jersey (VAF = 0.0%). The CD1D gene has known function in host immune response and parasite resistance,65,66 and also reported differentially expressed post intra-mammary infection.67 Majority of these stratified deletion regions are novel compared with previous CNV studies in cattle, and therefore are interesting targets to investigate large deletions undergoing genetic drift or artificial selection.

Highly stratified genic-deletions, e.g. overlapping exons, introns, or UTRs, are highlighted with HGNC gene symbol.3.4. Functional impact of deletionsWe annotated all the deletions using Variant Effect Predictor (Ensembl 87). Around 71% (6,019 SVs) variants were intergenic and remaining 29% (2,461 SVs) overlapped genic elements, such as exons, introns, and UTR. On average, high frequency gene disrupting deletions were somewhat depleted compared with intergenic variants (VAFintergenic > VAFgenic, P-value = 0.04; one-sided Wilcoxon test). Furthermore, we observed many common genic deletions. These genes are relatively less conserved, and majority has multiple paralogs (discussed later). However, deletions on known essential genes were only observed as heterozygote with relatively low VAF (<3%), and generally were private to a specific breed. For example, FANCI deletions (cause brachyspina7) were only observed in Holstein, and RNASEH2B deletions (cause embryonic lethality9) in Nordic Red Cattle.The relative abundance of high-frequency genic and intergenic variants indicate that majority of these intersected genes are non-essential, and thus did not affect the viability or fecundity of the carriers. To test this hypothesis, we analysed the selective constraints between deleted genes (overlap of any genic element) and known mouse lethal genes (from Dickinson et al.42) in terms of dN/dS ratio of cow-mouse 1-to-1 orthologues (Fig. 7). Here, high dN/dS values indicate low selective constraints on genes, and low value indicates high constraints. We found that genes in deletions have significantly higher dN/dS ratios than lethal genes (P-value 2.3 × 10-6; one-sided Wilcoxon test), and thus are evolutionarily less conserved. This is consistent with the rate of evolution seen in essential and non-essential genes—where mutations in essential genes were under strong purifying selection and thus evolved slowly (low dN/dS ratio), while non-essential genes were under relaxed selection, and hence, evolved faster (high dN/dS ratio).68 Nonetheless, robustness of these processes is also evident in the evolution of human essential genes. Interestingly, ~77% human essential genes could even be traced back to pre-metazoans.69Difference between dN/dS ratios of mouse-lethal and deletion-overlapped genes in cattle. Cow genes for which one-to-one mouse orthologues available were considered for a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

Cow genes for which one-to-one mouse orthologues available were considered for a one-sided Wilcoxon rank-sum test. Mouse lethal genes are from Dickinson et al.42In total, we found 5,000 deletions for which at least one individual was homozygous. In the set, we analysed homozygous deletions in genes to find natural gene knockouts. We found 167 deleted genes (transcript-ablation or complete deletion) corresponding to 115 independent deletions that are apparently nonessential based on the occurrences of live homozygote individuals. This is ~45% more than the previous report.23 Nonetheless, we found ~44% fewer genes compared with in humans (240 nonessential genes),15 which could be due to the differences in sample size (175 vs 2,504 individuals) and study populations (3 vs 26 populations in human).Among these genes, ~83% (139 genes) are protein-coding, 12% pseudogenes, and the rest are different types of small RNAs (Supplementary Table S6). Most of these genes belong to multigenic families and are not highly conserved (median cow-mouse dN/dS of 0.17 vs OMIA genes dN/dS of 0.11; Supplementary Fig. S6), as expected for homozygous deletion.15 Moreover, this set of genes are functionally enriched in immunoglobulin domains, olfactory receptors, and MHC classes (FDR = 2.06 × 10-22, 2.06 × 10-22, 7.01 × 10-6, respectively), along with other related domains (Supplementary Tables S7–S9). Similar functional enrichment of nonessential genes was also seen in humans.15 Olfactory receptor related genes are well known for extensive gains and losses in mammalian evolution.70 And population specific copy-number variations of olfactory receptor genes were also reported in human (deletions)71 and cattle (gains).72 Nevertheless, this is the first report, to our knowledge, of homozygous deletion of olfactory receptor genes in cattle.We next explored the enrichment (or depletion) of QTL on deleted regions (at least 1 bp overlap with deletion). We retrieved ~24 K autosomal QTL from QTLdb reported to be associated with any of the six trait classes, e.g. ‘Health’, ‘Reproduction’, ‘Milk’, ‘Exterior’, ‘Production’, and ‘Meat and Carcass’. The association of deletions with diseases, fitness or fertility related traits is well evident.3 Hence, we suspected enrichment of fitness and fertility related traits for our deletions. As expected, health (2-fold) and reproduction (1.5-fold) related QTL were significantly enriched, while other trait classes were highly depleted (Table 2). Higher enrichment of health related QTL could be driven by immune-system genes, which were also highly enriched in our dataset (discussed earlier).

Deletion formation mechanismsFinally we explored the probable mechanisms of deletion formation. There are two key mechanisms of SVs formation (for detail see review19,73); for example, recurrent SVs often result from ‘non-allelic homologous recombination’ between large low-copy repeats (LCRs), and thus, contain extensive sequence homology provided by LCRs, such as segmental duplicates, at the flanking regions.19 In contrast, non-recurrent SVs often form either by ‘microhomology-mediated end joining’ or ‘non-homologus end joining’, which requires limited to no sequence homology, and thus could be characterized by microhomologies or simple blunt ends at the breakpoint junction.73Breakpoint information is crucial for understanding the mechanism, and therefore, we analysed 29 breakpoint resolved deletions from our validation set. We found that 24 of 29 deletions contain microhomology ranging from 2 to 31 bp at the breakpoint, and two of which also contain insertions (Supplementary Table S2). In addition, four deletions exhibited non-reference insertion at breakpoint junctions, and one deletion with no apparent homology. However, the number of breakpoint sequences analysed here were not a robust representation of our deletion call-set (<0.5% deletions), though selected randomly (for validation), we were able to demonstrate that majority of deletions contain microhomoloy at breakpoint, followed by few insertions, and rarely with no homology. Our results largely agree with the trend reported for large deletions in humans, e.g. 70.8% deletions exhibited microhomology/homology and 16.1% insertions at the breakpoint.163.6. LimitationsThis study only focused on identifying deletions in cattle because of their potential relevance to loss-of-function and embryonic lethality. However, we had limited success to identify small deletions, such as <200 bp due to reduced sensitivity of the SV caller. It is also not a comprehensive list of deletions for these samples, since we could have missed many true deletions due to sensitivity, coverage, or stringent filtering (among other reasons). Furthermore, the short read length (~100 bp) in our WGS dataset also made it difficult to resolve breakpoints from regions of long repeats.3.7. ConclusionsLoss-of-function variants are responsible for a substantial yearly-economic loss in dairy industry, where a limited number of elite sires are in extensive use for rapid genetic gains. Mapping of such variants is essential for effective breeding planning and genomic selection. Here we showed an NGS-based analytical framework suitable for population-scale mapping of large deletions in cattle, leveraging the available WGSs. Here we described population-genetic, functional, and evolutionary properties of discovered deletions. We identified and confirmed a ~525 KB deletion on chromosome 23, causing stillbirth in Nordic Red Cattle. We demonstrated that Nordic Red Cattle had higher population diversity than Holstein and Jersey, and deletion-genotype could recapitulate genetic structure of these breeds. Natural gene knockouts are enriched for immune-related and olfactory receptor genes. We also showed that deletions are significantly enriched for health and fertility related QTL, while depleted for production related QTL. Our population genetic and functional analysis showed promise for inclusion of SVs in genomic studies in dairy cattle. This deletion catalog will facilitate discovery, genotyping, and imputation of deletions in large cohorts of animals, and subsequent studies for gene mapping and genomic prediction of breeding values.Md Mesbah-Uddin benefited from a joint grant from the European Commission within the framework of the Erasmus-Mundus joint doctorate ‘EGS-ABG’.FundingThis research was supported by the Center for Genomic Selection in Animals and Plants (GenSAP) funded by Innovation Fund Denmark (grant 0603-00519B).

IntroductionThe diploid strawberry F. vesca, also known as Alpine or woodland strawberry, is the most widely distributed species naturally growing in the northern hemisphere. It also contributed to one set of the octoploid genome of the cultivated strawberry Fragaria × ananassa.1,F. vesca genome (~240 Mb) is relatively small and its genome sequence was published in 2011.2 Several attributes of F. vesca make it a good model species of fruit crops, such as short stature, short life cycle, recurrent flowering, and high efficiency of transformation. To facilitate the gene functional studies in strawberry, we have identified and profiled the expression of protein-coding genes, lncRNAs and miRNAs using extensive transcriptome datasets generated mainly from flower and fruit tissues at different developmental stages with >80 individual libraries in F. vesca.3–7 As an emerging model species, F. vesca is playing more and more important roles both in the fields of basic biological research and in horticultural and agricultural research.The genome of F. vesca was first sequenced from a fourth-generation inbred line of Hawaii4 (F. vesca ssp. vesca) solely by second generation short read technologies, and its genome annotation v1.1 only contains protein-coding genes derived from ab initio gene predictions.2 Then, an updated annotation version (v1.1.a2) became available using 50 RNA-seq libraries generated from 25 different fruit tissue types to improve the annotation accuracy of protein-coding genes.8 In the meantime, a refined assembly of the F. vesca reference genome, named Fvb, was generated based on dense linkage maps of the North American diploid F. vesca ssp. bracteata.9 Compared with the original genome FvH4, Fvb features many translocations and inversions. Although Fvb still contains a large number of gaps that could be closed by utilizing long read sequencing technology, it has a much shorter unanchored pseudo-chromosome. The location of FvMYB10, a master regulator of anthocyanin production in strawberry, is moved from Chromosome 6 in FvH4 to Chromosome 1 in Fvb, where it is supposed to be according to genetic studies, illustrating that Fvb is of high quality.10 However, the gene annotation of Fvb (v2.0.a1) is not updated and merely obtained from the realignment of v1.1.Previously, we analysed the transcriptomes of floral and fruit tissues in F. vesca.3,4 During data analysis and gene functional studies, we noticed that a considerable proportion of genes are mis-annotated. The RNA-seq datasets from F. vesca (90 individual libraries) provide a rich data resource to re-annotate the genome. In addition, the PacBio full-length transcripts obtained from the fruit receptacle in F. vesca are also available,7 which were proven to significantly increase the accuracy of genome annotation without any assembly.11,12The annotation v2.0.a1 of Fvb contains only the coding regions from translation start site (ATG) to stop codon of protein-coding genes. However, recent studies highlight the importance of short ORFs (open reading frame) in 5' UTRs in fine-tuning gene functions.13 The 3' UTR sequences are also frequently needed for designing experiments. In addition, alternative splicing is an important regulatory mechanism at the post-transcriptional level, and up to 60% multi-exon protein-coding genes in plant genomes possess more than one isoform.7 Besides protein-coding genes, non-coding transcripts are pervasively expressed and constitute an integral part of the transcriptomes, including long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and miRNAs.5,6 Collectively, an updated genome annotation for F. vesca that marries the Fvb assembly with the broader collection of accurately predicted genes, coding and noncoding, is timely and highly desirable.Here, we optimized the genome annotation pipeline to improve the gene predictions in Fvb. We used a combination of MAKER2, AUGUSTUS, Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments (PASA), and manual curation to annotate protein-coding genes through integrating ab initio gene predictions, 90 RNA-seq transcriptome libraries and one PacBio full-length transcript library.14–17 The new annotation named V2.0.a2 not only updates the gene models of 13,168 loci, but also augments alternatively spliced isoforms of 7,370 genes, 5' and 3' UTRs of 18,641 genes, 1,938 lncRNAs, 171 miRNAs, and 51,714 small RNA clusters. Overall, V2.0.a2 provides a much more complete annotation of the F. vesca genome and will better serve gene functional studies in strawberry and other Rosaceae species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Transcriptome datasets used in this studyBoth full-length transcripts generated by PacBio and RNAseq datasets from different F. vesca accessions were used as evidence for gene annotation. The PacBio reads were generated from pooled fruit receptacles at different developmental stages.7 A total of 90 Illumina RNA-seq libraries are respectively generated from fruits, flowers, meristems, and roots.3,4,18 In addition, nine small RNA-seq libraries generated from vegetative, flower, and fruit tissues were also used for small RNA identification in this study.5 Details of these datasets are described in Supplementary Table S1.2.2. High-fidelity gene models identified from SMRT readsThe RS_IsoSeq pipeline (v2.3) was employed to analyse the PacBio data. First, the reads longer than 500 bp with the minimum full pass number of 2 and a quality score above 90 were retained. Then, the full-length reads having 5' primer, 3' primer, and a poly-A tail were further selected for downstream analysis. Next, these full-length reads were collapsed into consensus transcripts by ICE and Quiver in the isoseq_cluster panel. The LoRDEC software was used to correct the sequencing errors in the consensus transcripts using Illumina reads as the reference (parameters: -k 19 -s 3).19 The corrected consensus transcripts were then mapped by GMAP with >85% alignment coverage and >90% alignment identity.20 At last, the aligned transcripts were used for the identification of the best gene models using Program to Assemble Spliced Alignments (PASA).14 The scripts gff3_to_SNAP_train.pl bundled with SNAP, gmes_petap.pl bundled with GeneMark, and optimize_augustus.pl bundled with AUGUSTUS were used for training of each tool by the high-fidelity gene models with default parameters.2.3. A comprehensive transcriptome built from RNA-seq datasets and SMRT reads using PASAThe RNA-seq reads with more that 90% of their bases having a quality score higher than 28 were retained using fastq_quality_filter (-q 28 -p 90), and the bases with low quality score in each RNA-seq read were trimmed off using fastx_trim built in FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/ (5 September 2017, date last accessed)). Each library was mapped individually to Fvb9 downloaded from GDR (https://www.rosaceae.org (5 September 2017, date last accessed)) using Tophat221 with the following parameters: maximum intron size, 10,000bp; minimum intron size, 20 bp; fr-firststrand for strand-specific libraries.Reference-based assembly: For flower and fruit tissues, the aligned BAM files of the two biological replicates were, respectively, merged and sorted using Samtools (version 1.2)22 due to relatively lower sequencing depth, resulting in a total of 37 BAM files. The analyses on other libraries were carried out individually. Next, transcripts were assembled individually for each library by Stringtie23 with default settings except that the minimum isoform fraction was set to 0.3 to remove weakly expressed isoforms.De novo assembly: All the RNA-seq reads were pooled together for de novo assembly using Trinity24 with default parameters.To build a comprehensive transcriptome, the ID accessions of full-length and de novo transcripts were first fed into PASA, and full-length, genome-guided and de novo transcripts generated in parallel were then collapsed, mapped back to Fvb, and reconstructed by PASA through its alignment assembly module. The comprehensive transcriptome was later used as the mRNA evidence for MAKER2 described in the following section.2.4. MAKER2 annotationMAKER2 was used for generating an initial gene annotation.15 First, RepeatModeler (http://www.repeatmasker.org/ (5 September 2017, date last accessed)) was employed to identify and classify repeats from the genome Fvb, and then RepeatMasker (Repbase version 20160829) was used to generate a masked genome. Plant protein sequences were downloaded from UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org/ (5 September 2017, date last accessed)) on 21 January 2017. MAKER2 was run on the masked Fvb with following evidence: Fvb annotation v2.0.a1, the comprehensive transcriptome, UniProt proteins, AUGUSTUS trained models, SNAP trained models, and GeneMark trained models.2.5. Further improve the genome using Augustus and EVMTo use Augustus,25 the following evidence were provided: (i) intron hints converted from uniquely mapped RNA-seq reads using the script bet_to_gff.pl bundled with GeneMark; (ii) intron hints converted from PacBio full-length transcripts by GMAP (http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/bioinf/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Augustus.PacBioGMAP (5 September 2017, date last accessed)); (iii) Protein hints generated from mapping UniPro proteins to masked genome by Exonerate;26 (iv) repeat hints from the RepeatMasker output (http://bioinf.uni-greifswald.de/bioinf/wiki/pmwiki.php?n=Augustus.IncorporateRepeats (5 September 2017, date last accessed)). These hints were fed into Augustus to generate the high confidence gene models.Next, EVidenceModeler (EVM)27 was used to combine MAKER2 gene models, Augustus gene models, transcripts from SMRT and Illumina RNA-seq, and UniProt proteins with a nonstochastic weighted value into confident consensus gene models. The weight value for each part is: six for MAKER2 gene models, eight for Augustus gene models, 10 for SMRT transcripts, eight for Illumina transcripts, and three for homologous proteins. Finally, PASA was used to improve the EVM gene models by modifying gene structures and adding UTR annotations and alternatively spliced isoforms.2.6. Manual curation of new annotationAll the gene models were inspected one by one and manually curated using a plug-in called Apollo28 in JBrowse Genome Viewer29 based on the mapped reads from different RNA-seq libraries.2.7. Alternative splicing analysisAStalavista30 was employed to classify the alternative splicing events in the v2.0.a2 annotation. It groups the events into four major types, namely IR, ES, AA, and AD. The event belonging to each type were extracted from the AStalavista output by following codes: IR (AS code: 1^2-,0), ES (AS code: 1- 2^, 0), AA (AS code: 1-,2-), and AD (AS code: 1^,2^).2.8. Prediction of lncRNAsTwo approaches were used to identify lncRNAs. The transcripts combined from the assemblies of Illumina RNA-seq and PacBio full-length reads were used for screening lncRNAs. The mono-exonic transcripts were removed to reduce false positives due to transcriptional noise and ambiguous alignment. In the first approach, the transcripts with class_code ‘u’ (unknown intergenic transcript), ‘o’ (generic exonic overlap with a reference transcript), ‘x’ (natural antisense transcript, NAT), and ‘i’ (intronic transcript) were selected. Then, the transcripts with length > 200nt and ORF < 300nt were retained. Next, the left transcripts were blasted against the Swiss-Protein database by BLASTX (2.6.0)31 with E-values < 1e-3 to remove potential protein-coding transcripts. At last, we used Coding Potential Calculator32 to calculate the CPC score of each transcript, and only those with a CPC score < 0 were considered as lncRNA candidates. In the second approach, lncRNAs were identified from the same set of transcripts by FEELnc33 using the specificity threshold 0.97. The transcripts overlapping protein-coding genes in v2.0.a2 and < 200 nt in length were eliminated. FEELnc used the ORF coverage (i.e. length of the longest ORF/length of the lncRNA transcript), k-mer frequency, nucleotide frequency, and codon usage to distinguish between mRNAs and lncRNAs. Finally, the consensus transcripts identified by both methods were designated as lncRNAs. These lncRNAs were grouped into two major types (genic and intergenic) and six subtypes based on the localization and the direction of transcription relative to the proximal protein-coding genes by the FEELnc classifier module called FEELncclassifier.2.9. Alignment of small RNAsThe raw reads from 9 small RNA-seq libraries generated from tissues of F. vesca5 were used for the identification of small RNAs. First, the 3' adapters were trimmed off using Cutadapt.34 Then, the resulting .fasta file was mapped against the Fvb genome using bowtie (version 0.12.8)35 with following parameters: -q -v 0 -p 30 -S -a -m 50. ShortStack36 was subsequently employed to identify small RNA clusters, and only the dominant 20- to 24- nt in length and DCL-derived small RNA loci (more possibly related to RNAi) called out by ShortStack were retained. The expression level of each small RNA cluster was normalized using the count mode in ShortStack with default settings.2.10. Alignment of miRNAsThe stem-loop sequences of 171 miRNAs in F. vesca predicted by a previous report5 were mapped to the new F. vesca genome assembly Fvb by bowtie2 with default parameters, then the SAM file was converted into the GFF format by an in-house python script and integrated into the v2.0.a2 annotation file.2.11. Experimental verification of new gene modelsTotal RNA was isolated from the fruit receptacle of YW5AF7 (the 7th generation inbred line of Yellow Wonder, an accession of F. vesca) using the Plant Total RNA Isolation Kit (Sangon Biotech, Shanghai, China, No. SK8631) following manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA was synthesized from 1 µg total RNA in 20 µl solution using the PrimeScriptTM RT reagent kit (TaKaRa, Shiga, Japan, Cat# RR047A). KOD DNA polymerase (TOYOBO Bio-Tech, Cat# F0934K) was used to amplify the coding regions of selected genes for Sanger sequencing with primers listed in Supplementary Table S5. The sequencing results were aligned with the sequences obtained from new annotations by Clustal Omega (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/clustalo/ (5 September 2017, date last accessed)).3. Results and discussion3.1. Update of gene models of protein-coding genes in Fvb based on SMRT and Illumina RNA-seq datasetsIn this study, a new Fvb annotation named version 2.0.a2 (v2.0.a2) was created that includes protein-coding genes, alternatively spliced isoforms of multiexon genes, small RNAs, and lncRNAs. An optimized workflow to annotate protein-coding genes and their isoforms is shown in Figure 1. To take advantage of the extensive RNA-seq datasets, MAKER2, specifically designed for second-generation genome projects, was first used to generate an initial protein-coding gene annotation.15 Input data for MAKER2 include (i) repeats masked genome Fvb, (ii) ab initio gene predictors, including SNAP, GeneMaker, and Augustus, each trained with high-fidelity gene models, (iii) plant protein sequences downloaded from UniProt databases, (iv) transcripts assembled from a total of 90 Illumina RNA-seq libraries, (v) full length transcripts obtained from one PacBio transcriptome library (Supplementary Table S1). The Illumina RNA-Seq datasets were generated from a series of tissue types in F. vesca, including leaf, seedling, root, shoot apical meristem, flower meristem, anther and carpel from flowers at different developmental stages and different fruit tissues at five stages with an average of 30 million and a range from 12 million to 89 million reads per library (see details in Supplementary Table S1). In total, there are 2.5 billion RNA-Seq short reads. The PacBio data was generated from fruit receptacles pooled from small green to mature stages in F. vesca, containing 82,360 full-length consensus transcripts derived from 442,601ReadofInserts.

The red dotted box indicates the core tools used for the annotation. In the end, manual curation was carried out to assure the accuracy.The ambiguity of transcript reconstruction will affect the accuracy of gene annotation when using MAKER2. To avoid assembly errors in gene prediction, it is advantageous to use the transcript information in unassembled mapped reads.37 Augustus is a gene finder that can incorporate data from RNA-seq reads (junctions reads) directly into weighted predictions, join exons into a single gene and identify alternative transcription events.25 Therefore, Augustus was employed to further improve gene predictions through incorporating the intron hints from RNA-seq reads and protein hints from UniProt databases. Then, the gene structures predicted by both MAKER2 and Augustus were combined into consensus gene models using EVidenceModeler (EVM),27 and the gene models generated from EVM were updated by PASA.14 At last, the new annotation was inspected across the entire genome in IGV38 to evaluate the prediction and select the optimal gene models by comparing with the aligned RNA-seq reads, and about 1,000 (3%) genes were manually curated in this way.Annotation v2.0.a2 of the genome Fvb contains a final set of 33,538 protein-coding loci with 50,738 transcripts (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S2). The Locus IDs for 30,012 identical or modified genes stay the same between the older annotation v2.0a1 and this annotation (v2.0.a2), while 3,525 genes (novel or split) were newly numbered using the same nomenclature as previous annotations (i.e. GeneXXXXX). The Locus IDs in both versions for the newly modified genes are listed in Supplementary Table S3. One improvement of v2.0.a2 is that a total of 18,641 genes were augmented by inclusion of 5' UTRs and/or 3' UTRs, representing nearly 55.6% of all protein-coding genes (Fig. 2a and b). Moreover, the gene models of 13,168 protein-coding genes were modified and updated (Fig. 2a and c). More specifically, 2,692 genes were derived from splitting longer genes (previously fused genes), and 213 genes were obtained by fusing neighbouring genes (Fig. 2a, d, and e). In addition, 2,031 genes were removed, and 631 genes were added (Fig. 2a). To further evaluate the quality of the annotation, the BUSCO genes39 were compared between v2.0.a1 and v2.0.a2. The results show a significant increase of complete BUSCOs from 88.9% for v2.0.a1 to 95.7% for v2.0.a2, while the fragmented and missing BUSCOs were reduced in v2.0.a2 (Table 1), indicating a higher quality annotation. These updates will better serve gene structure and functional studies.

Functional annotation of protein-coding genesTo update the functional annotation of novel and pre-existing protein-coding genes in v2.0.a2, all the protein sequences were blasted against known proteins in the InterPro databases using InterProScan.40 In addition, each gene was also blasted against the NCBI non-redundant (nr) protein database to gain the Gene ontology (GO) term by Blast2go.41 As a result, a total of 28,798 and 22,106 genes in v2.0.a2 gained functional annotations and GO terms, respectively (Table 1). Especially, there is a great increase in the percentage of genes with GO terms, from 51% in v2.0.a1 to 66% in v2.0.a2 (Table 1). For novel genes, 527 of the 631 loci (83.5%) were assigned with functional annotations.Transcription factors and regulators and protein kinases usually play crucial roles during signal transduction. In the iTAK pipeline42 that we used for the classification of these genes, transcription factors are defined as proteins that regulate the expression of target genes by binding to specific cis-elements in promoter regions, while transcriptional regulators operate indirectly via interaction with the basal transcription apparatus (e.g. transcription factors) or by altering the accessibility of DNA to TFs via chromatin remodelling to regulate the expression of target genes. As a result, we identified 1,542 transcription factors from 68 families, and 390 transcriptional regulators in the v2.0.a2 annotation by using the iTAK pipeline (Supplementary Table S4).42 The total number of transcription factors is comparable to that of v2.0.a1, but a few gene families have gained relatively more members, such as the B3 family from 67 to 78, MYB from 112 to 118, and bHLH from 90 to 101 (Supplementary Table S4). There are 1,055 protein kinase encoding genes in v2.0.a2, which are 90 more in the older annotation (Supplementary Table S4).Disease resistance is an important agricultural trait for strawberry as well as other fruit crops, thus we also used the RGAugury pipeline43 to analyse R-genes and pattern-recognition receptors (PRRs), collectively called resistance gene analogs (RGAs), in the two annotation versions of Fvb. The RGAs are classified into four major families based on conserved domains and motifs in this pipeline, namely NBS encoding, membrane associated RLP (receptor-like protein) and RLK (receptor-like protein kinase), and TM-CC (transmembrane-coiled-coil).43 The first three families were further grouped into a few subfamilies. A total of 1,190 RGAs were identified, including 340 NBS encoding genes, 122 RLPs, 590 RLKs, and 138 TM-CCs in v2.0.a2 (Supplementary Table S5). Although the gene number in the NBS encoding family is comparable between the two annotations, the TNL subfamily has much more members (from 17 to 79), while the TX subfamily has fewer members (from 124 to 59) (Supplementary Table S5). The size of the RLP and RLK families doesn’t change much. However, the gene number in the TM-CC family is significantly decreased, from 192 genes in v2.0.a1 to 138 genes in v2.0.a2.With the advantage of strand-specific RNA-seq reads, we were able to distinguish the sense and antisense transcripts from one locus. One example of such a locus having overlapping transcripts derived from opposite strands is gene02467, which codes for a tRNA ligase. This gene is located in one intron of an extremely long gene called gene02466 that encodes the ATP-binding cassette transporter A1 (Fig. 3a). By contrast, the same locus was previously annotated to have four genes in v2.0.a1 (Fig. 3a). FvSOC1, the homolog of AtSOC1 (SUPPRESSOR OF THE OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS), is a key negative regulator of flowering and a positive regulator of runnering in F. vesca.44,FvSOC1 does not exist in v2.0.a1. However, the modified gene19424 with a brand new gene model in v2.0.a2 has exactly the same sequence as the EST of FvSOC1 (accession number in NCBI: JF806634) (Fig. 3b). In addition, some gene models were fine-tuned in v2.0.a2 to have a higher annotation quality. For instance, FvTFL1, another crucial floral repressor in F.vesca,45,46 has a new translation start site producing a shorter protein, which becomes consistent with the published sequence in NCBI (accession number: JF806631) (Fig. 3c). A few other mis-annotated genes encoding glutathione S-transferases (GSTs), the red/far-red photoreceptor phytochrome B, and a bHLH transcription factor were PCR amplified, cloned and sequenced to confirm the v2.0.a2 annotation (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S6). Taken together, not only were a large proportion of pre-existing genes corrected, but also novel genes with potentially important roles were discovered and incorporated into the new annotation.

Alternatively spliced genes in v2.0.a2Alternative splicing (AS) is an important regulatory mechanism at post-transcriptional level and is prevalent in animals as well as plants.47,48 However, the v2.0.a1 annotation does not provide any information about the isoforms alternatively spliced from the pre-mRNAs. The v2.0.a2 annotation takes into account and provides the specific information on the alternatively spliced transcripts predicted by our analysis pipeline (Fig. 1). To increase the prediction accuracy, weakly expressed transcripts in the RNA-seq datasets were removed during the assembly using Stringtie.23 A total of 16,705 alternative transcripts were detected genome-wide from 7,370 multiexon genes, accounting for 21.98% of the 33,538 protein-coding genes. The average transcript number per gene is 1.51. As we used a more stringent filtering strategy, much fewer isoforms were presented in v2.0.a2 than that of our previous study (47,000 isoforms from 13,591 alternatively spliced genes, accounting for 41.6% of all the protein coding genes).7Among the AS genes, about half of them (46.85%) possess only two isoforms, 23.19% genes possess three isoforms, and 1.28% genes have >10 isoforms (Fig. 4a). 7,370 AS genes showed enriched GO terms in all kinds of metabolic processes (Supplementary Table S7), consistent with our previous studies.7,49 To better characterize alternative splicing (AS) in the new annotation, AStalavista was used to group the AS events into a few major types.30 3,434 events are of alternative 3' splice sites (A3), 1,351 events are of alternative 5' splice sites (A5), 4,245 events are due to intron retention (IR), and 1,029 events result from exon skipping (ES) (Fig. 4b). Consistent with other studies,7,49 the percentage of IR (32.39%) is the greatest, while the percentage of ES (7.85%) is the least. Features of the alternative splicing events in v2.0.a2.

Non-coding RNAsNon-coding RNAs are the integral part of the genome. To further improve the annotation of F.vesca genome, the loci producing small RNAs and lncRNAs were both integrated into the new annotation v2.0.a2.Thus far, most of the small RNAs with known functions are 21–24nt long, such as small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), miRNAs, phasiRNAs, and tasiRNAs. These small RNAs regulate the expression of target genes through transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) or post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS). Among them, 171 miRNAs, including 44 novel miRNAs and 127 conserved miRNAs, have been previously identified in F. vesca,5 but their locations in the genome are lacking. In this study, the stem-loop precursor sequences of these miRNAs were all uniquely aligned to Fvb, and the coordinates for the stem-loop and mature miRNA sequences were integrated into v2.0.a2 (Supplementary Table S8).Besides, siRNAs of 24nt are most widespread in the genome.6 Here, we analyzed a total of 9 small RNA-seq libraries generated from open flower, 4 DPA (days post anthesis)-seed, 10 DPA-seed, 4 DPA-carpel wall, 10 DPA-carpel wall, flower bud, young leaf, young seedling, and 10 DPA-fruit receptacle in F. vesca from a previous study.5 ShortStack,36 a popular pipeline used for small RNA annotation in Arabidopsis and other species,49–51 was employed to identify small RNA clusters with 20–24nt small RNAs in Fvb. Finally, 51,714 small RNA clusters were identified with 24nt small RNAs as the most abundant type, accounting for 98.46% out of all small RNA clusters (Supplementary Table S9). Furthermore, 15,705 (30.4%) and 1,544 (2.99%) of these clusters overlap with protein-coding genes and lncRNAs, respectively. When the gene density of small RNA clusters was plotted across the seven chromosomes, it roughly negatively correlated with that of protein-coding genes in both v2.0.a1 and v2.0.a2 (Fig. 5).

Darker colour indicates a higher density.LncRNAs are defined as non-coding RNAs with a length >200 bp. To annotate lncRNAs in F. vesca, we used two independent methods to identify them and only retained the consensus ones (see Methods). Overall, we identified a total of 1,938 lncRNA loci with more than one exon in the F. vesca genome, corresponding to a total of 4,042 transcripts (2.1 isoforms per locus on average). The exon number distribution of lncRNAs showed that lncRNAs have fewer exons than protein coding genes. 53% of lncRNAs possess two or three exons, while only 32% of the protein-coding genes possess two or three exons (Fig. 6a). The gene length of lncRNAs varies from 201 to 12,722 bp, and the mean length is 1,479 bp. In this pipeline, the lncRNAs were first classified into two major groups, intergenic and genic, based on the location relative to protein-coding genes (Supplementary Fig. S2). Intergenic lncRNAs can be further classified into three subgroups: same_strand, located in the same strand with the neighbouring protein-coding gene; convergent, convergent transcription with the neighbouring protein-coding gene in different strands; divergent, divergent transcription with the neighbour protein-coding gene in different strands (Supplementary Fig. S2). Genic lncRNAs can also be classified into three subgroups: overlapping, lncRNA is longer at one end and shorter at the other end than the overlapped protein-coding gene; containing, lncRNA is longer than the overlapped protein-coding gene at both ends; nested, lncRNA is shorter than the overlapped protein-coding gene at both ends.33 Among the 4,042 lncRNA transcripts, the intergenic type contains 1,413 same_strand, 873 convergent, and 786 divergent lncRNA transcripts; the genic type contains 689 overlapping, 74 containing, and 207 nested transcripts (Fig. 6b;Supplementary Fig. S2 and Table S10).

ConclusionsThe F. vesca genome was first released with annotations of merely protein coding genes that were mainly derived from ab initio predictions.2 Then, an updated genome of high quality called Fvb was re-assembled based on genetic linkage mapping with the same annotation.9 RNA-seq datasets generated from strawberry fruits have been previously utilized for F. vesca genome reannotation,8 however, it was based on limited number and type of tissue samples, short Illumina reads, and was again restricted to protein-coding genes. With the recent advancement in genome sequencing, especially the availability of third generation long read sequencing data, and accumulation of large number of RNA-seq datasets from diverse tissues, creating a new and improved re-annotation for the most recent genome assembly is timely. Here, we developed an optimized pipeline to re-annotate the strawberry Fvb genome taking advantage of PacBio full-length transcripts and an extensive dataset of RNA-seq libraries. This new annotation, v2.0.a2, updated the F. vesca gene models and includes new information ranging from 5' and 3' UTRs to alternatively spliced transcripts. In addition, non-coding genes, including small RNAs and lncRNAs, were also integrated into this new annotation. To conclude, our new annotation is much more complete than the older annotation and will provide a valuable resource for the strawberry and the Rosaceae research community as well as for comparative and functional studies in flowering plants.5.

IntroductionNon-coding RNA such as microRNAs (miRNA) and long non-coding RNAs exist in many cells and regulate gene expression and possibly perform other biological functions.1–5 Circular RNAs are a novel non-coding RNA that forms a covalently closed continuous loop and have been observed for decades in plant viroids6 and in a few mammalian genes.7–10 CircRNAs were generally considered to be splicing artifacts or by-products until recent advances in RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) technology.11 CircRNAs are served as a new class of RNAs that have been identified widespread in eukaryotic tissues and cells from humans, mice, nematodes, fruit flies and plants.12–19CircRNAs can arise from exons, introns, untranslated regions, non-coding RNA loci as well as intergenic and antisense transcripts. They are abundantly and widely expressed in eukaryotes, and often show tissue and developmental stage-specific expression patterns.12,15,20 In some genes, circular RNA isoforms are even more abundant than their linear counterparts.21 CircRNAs are also expressed across eukaryotes, and in humans, hundreds of exonic circRNAs are found to be with circular orthologues in murine.18–22The biological functions of circRNA are still largely unknown but they are implicated in the regulation of gene expression at multiple levels. Some exonic circRNAs (eciRNA) can function as miRNA sponges, which compete with mRNAs for miRNA binding and thus up-regulate the expression of miRNAs target gene. One representative example is the cerebellar degeneration-related 1 antisense transcript (CDR1as) that contains over 60 conserved miR-7 target sites.13,14 A CDR1as knockdown leads to reduced expression of mRNAs containing miR-7-binding sites. Overexpression of CDR1as has an effect similar to a miR-7 knockdown and this impaired midbrain development in zebrafish.13 Circular RNAs can regulate transcription via RNA Pol II interactions and have been demonstrated for the ciRNA (intronic circular RNA) ci-ankrd52 and ci-sirt7.23 EIciRNAs (exon-intron circular RNA) regulate their parental genes through interaction with the spliceosome component U1 snRNP (small nuclear ribonucleoprotein).24 CircRNA biogenesis may also compete with pre-mRNA splicing and thus regulate linear mRNA levels.25 In addition, some circRNAs have been found to serve as templates for coding peptides or proteins, especially in that modified by N6-methyladenosine or with the presence of internal ribosomal entry sites (IRES).26–29Skeletal muscle is the most important component of food animals and directly correlates with meat quantity and quality. The growth and development of skeletal muscle involves a series of very complex biological process, regulated by many signaling pathways, genes, transcription factors and ncRNAs.30–33 CircRNAs can play important roles in biologic processes as well as human disease.34–36 CircRNAs also have been identified abundantly expressed in monkey skeletal muscle and may play key roles in growth and development.37 In this study, we identified circRNAs during chicken embryonic skeletal muscle development by RNA sequencing to explore the functions of circRNAs in chicken skeletal muscle.2. Materials and methods2.1. Ethics standardsAnimal experiments were handled in compliance and all efforts were made to minimize suffering. It was approved by the Animal Care Committee of South China Agricultural University (Guangzhou, China) with approval number SCAU#0014.2.2. Samples for circular RNA sequencingA total of 240 XH chickens of E10 embryonic age were obtained from the Chicken Breeding Farm of South China Agricultural University (Guangzhou, China), and incubated in Automatic Incubator (Oscilla, Shandong, China) at 37.8 °C, with 60 ± 10% humidity. During E10 to 1 day post hatch (P1), leg muscles of 20 XH chickens were collected daily. The sex of chicken embryo was identified by PCR of the CHD1 gene.38 Leg muscles of female XH chickens at E11, E16 and P1 were used for circular RNA sequencing.2.3. Circular RNA library construction and Illumina sequencingTotal RNAs of six female chickens (E11, E16, and P1; each stage two individuals), were isolated by using Trizol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and then treated with DNase (Promega, Madison, WI, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The quantity and quality of RNAs were evaluated by Nanodrop2000 (Thermo, Waltham, MA, USA) and gel electrophoresis. Total RNA samples (5 µg) were treated with the Ribo-Zero-magnetic-kit (Epicenter, Madison, Wisconsin, USA) to remove rRNA, and then digested with 20 U of RNase R (RNR07250, Epicenter). RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using the Tru Seq RNA LT Sample Prep Kit v2 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The libraries were sequenced using an Illumina Hiseq 3000 instrument with a Paired-End module (at a depth of 50 million reads) at Genergy Biotechnology Co., Ltd. (Shanghai, China).2.4. Annotation of chicken circRNAsAll sequencing data are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with accession number (GSE89355). For all raw sequencing data of each sample, adapter reads and low-quality reads were removed using Trim Galore (http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/ (16 September 2017, date last accessed)). The filtered data were mapped to the chicken genome (Gallus_gallus-4.0/galGal4) using TopHat software.39 The mapping reads was performed transcript assembly using Cufflinks software.40 Identification of circRNAs was performed using CIRI.412.5. Differential expression analysisExpression levels of circRNAs were quantified using the number of reads spanning back-spliced junctions (circular reads). The relative expression of circRNAs was denoted as BSRP (back-spliced reads per million mapped reads), using circular reads normalized to per million mapped reads. Differentially expressed circRNAs among three groups (E11, E16 and P1) were identified using the DESEQ software package (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEGseq.html (16 September 2017, date last accessed)) with a t test q-value < 0.05 and fold change > 2. The top 200 expressed circRNAs were log2 transformed, gene mean centered and visualized as heatmaps using the Multi Experiment Viewer (http://www.tm4.org/ (16 September 2017, date last accessed)).2.6. Target miRNA prediction, pathway and network analysisAll exonic circRNAs were used to predict miRNAs potential binding sites using miRanda (http://www.microrna.org/microrna/home.do (16 September 2017, date last accessed)) with threshold parameters as follows: single-residue-pair match scores > 140, <U+0394>G < -10 kcal/mol and demand strict 5’ seed pairing. All parental genes of differentially expressed circRNAs were subjected to Gene Ontology (GO) (http://www.geneontology.org/ (16 September 2017, date last accessed)) and KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/ (16 September 2017, date last accessed)) pathway enrichment analysis using DAVID 6.7 Functional Annotation Tool (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/ (16 September 2017, date last accessed)). All parental genes of circRNAs were set as the background gene list. Gene network analysis was performed by Ingenuity Pathways analysis (IPA; Ingenuity Systems; http://www.ingenuity.com (16 September 2017, date last accessed)).2.7. Validation of circRNAs by Sanger sequencingThe circRNAs were validated using PCR with divergent and convergent primers as previously described.22 Divergent primers were designed in regions about 100 bp from a junction, and convergent primers were designed in regions of one exon (Details of primers are summarized in Supplementary Table S1). To confirm the junction sequence of circRNAs, PCR products of divergent primers were gel purified and submitted for Sanger sequencing at Sangon Biotech Co. Ltd (Shanghai, China).2.8. cDNA synthesis and quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR)Total RNA was used for reverse transcription using RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Fermentas, Waltham, MA, USA) with either random hexamers or specific primers for miRNAs as indicated. The relative expression levels of circRNAs or miRNAs were determined by qRT-PCR using SsoFast Eva Green Supermix (Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) in a final volume of 20 µl. To check the sensitivity of circRNA to RNaseR, qRT-PCR was also performed using RNA samples with and without RNaseR treatment. Primers used for circRNAs were designed as divergent primers to detect backsplice junctions, and bulge-loop primers were synthesized by Ribobio (Guangzhou, China) for miRNAs (Details of primers are summarized in Supplementary Table S1). The ß-actin gene was used as reference genes for circRNAs, and U6 snRNA was used as reference gene for miRNAs. The qRT-PCR program was performed in a BIO-RAD CFX96 system as follows: 95 °C for 3 min; 40 cycles of 95 °C for 10 s, annealing temperature (58–62 °C) for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s; and 72 °C for 1 min. The relative expression level of miRNA was calculated using the comparative 2-<U+0394>Ct (<U+0394>Ct = Cttarget gene– Ctreference gene). Fold change values were calculated using the comparative 2-<U+0394><U+0394>Ct, in which <U+0394><U+0394>Ct = <U+0394>Ct (target sample) - <U+0394>Ct (control sample). All reactions were run in triplicate and presented as means ± s.e.m. The Student’s t-test was used to compare expression levels among different groups.2.9. Vector construction and RNA oligonucleotidesThe perfect match sequence of gga-miR-1a-3p° or gga-miR-206 was synthesized and cloned into the psiCHECK-2 vector (Promega) using the NotI and XhoI restriction sites. The circRNA overexpression vectors were constructed using the linear sequences of circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 amplified from chicken leg muscle cDNA using PCR. They were then cloned into pCD-ciR2.1vector (Supplementary Fig. S1, Geneseed Biotech, Guangzhou, China) according to the manufacturer’s protocol using the KpnI and BamHI restriction sites. The wild type and mutated 3’UTRs sequences of CCND1, CCND2, PAX7 and HDAC4 were synthesized and cloned into the pmirGLO dual-luciferase reporter vector (Promega) using the NheI and XhoI restriction sites. The exon2-3 or exon2-4 of RBFOX2 were synthesized and cloned into the pcDNA3.1+ vector (Invitrogen) using the NheI and SalI restriction sites. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) of circRNAs (sequences are summarized in Supplementary Table S1), miRNA mimics and inhibitors were synthesized by Ribobio.2.10. Cell culture and transfectionChicken primary myoblasts were isolated from the leg muscles of E11 chickens. Leg muscle (1 g) was minced into sections of approximately 1 mm with scissors and digested with 0.25% trypsin (Gibco, Grand Island, NY, USA) at 37 °C in a shaking water bath (90 oscillations/min). Digestions were terminated by adding foetal bovine serum (Gibco) after 30 min. The mixture was filtered through a nylon mesh with 70 µm pores (BD Falcon). The filtered cells were centrifuged at 350g for 5 min, and maintained in Dulbecco’s modified Eagle medium (DMEM) (Gibco), supplemented with 20% foetal bovine serum, and 0.2% penicillin/streptomycin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) at 37 °C in a 5% CO2, humidified atmosphere. Serial plating was performed to enrich myoblasts and remove fibroblasts. DF-1 cells were cultured in DMEM with 10% foetal bovine serum and 0.2% penicillin/streptomycin. QM-7 cells were cultured in high-glucose M199 medium (Gibco) with 10% foetal bovine serum, 10% tryptose phosphate broth solution (Sigma, Louis, MO, USA) and 0.2% penicillin/streptomycin. Cells were transfected with 50 nM of miRNA mimics, 100 nM of miRNA inhibitors, 100 nM of siRNA or plasmid (1 µg/ml) using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.2.11. Luciferase reporter assay and Northern blot analysisDF-1 cells were seeded in 96-well plates and co-transfected with the dual-luciferase reporter (psiCHECK-2) and miRNA mimics or NC (negative control) and with circRNA overexpression vector, circRNA mutated vector or empty vector (EV) using Lipofectamine 3000 reagent. After transfection for 48 h, the luminescent signals of firefly and Renilla luciferase were detected using Dual-GLO Luciferase Assay System Kit (Promega) with a Fluorescence/Multi-Detection Microplate Reader (Biotek,Winooski, VT, USA). Northern blotting for miR-206 and U6 were performed with MiRNA Northern Blot Assay Kit (Signosis, Santa Clara, CA, USA) following the manufacturer’s instructions.2.12. Flow cytometry analysis of the cell cycleAfter transfection 48 h, myoblasts were collected and fixed in 70% ethanol overnight at -20 °C. The cells were incubated with 50 µg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma), 10 µg/ml RNaseA (Takara) and 0.2% (v/v) Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 30 min at 4 °C. Analyses were performed using a BD AccuriC6 flow cytometer (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA, USA) and FlowJo (v7.6) software (Treestar Incorporated, Ashland, OR, USA).2.13. EdU assayQM-7 cells were seeded in 12-well plates, and at 80% confluence, cell were transfected with overexpression vector or siRNA of circRNAs, miRNA mimic, miRNA inhibitor or negative control. After transfection for 36 h, cell proliferation was tested using a Cell-Light EdU Apollo 567 in Vitro Flow Cytometry Kit (Ribobio). The cells were first incubated with 50 µM EDU for 2 h at 37 °C, and then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min and permeabilized with 0.5% Triton X-100. The proliferating cells were stained with Apollo Dye Solution and Hoechst 33342 (used as control). The EdU-stained cells were visualized by fluorescence microscopy (Nikon, Tokyo, Japan). The cell proliferation rate was calculated using images of randomly selected fields obtained from the fluorescence microscope. We performed four repeats for each group, and three images were used to calculate the cell proliferation rate in each repeat.2.14. HistologyThe leg muscle samples were <U+FB01>xed in 4% paraformaldehyde for a minimum of 24 h and then embedded in paraffin and 10-mm thick serial sections were made. The sections were then subjected to H-E staining following standard protocols. Images were taken using a Moticam 2306 CCD imaging system (Motic Instruments, CA, USA).2.15. RNA immunoprecipitation and biotin-coupled miRNA pull downRIP experiments were performed by using the Magna RIP RNA-Binding Protein Immunoprecipitation Kit (Millipore, Bedford, MA) following the manufacturer’s instructions. Immunoprecipitation of AGO2 was performed in QM7 cells co-transfected with circRBFOX2s expression vector and miR-1a-3p°, miR-206 or miR-203 control. The mRNA levels of circRBFOX2s were quantified by qRT–PCR and were normalized to GAPDH gene. The relative immunoprecipitate/input ratios are plotted.The 3’ end biotinylated miR-1a-3p°, miR-206 or miR-203 mimic (RiboBio) were transfected into QM7 cells along with circRBFOX2s expression vector. The biotin-coupled RNA complex was pull-downed by Dynabeads MyOne Streptavidin C1 kit (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA bound to the beads (pull-down RNA) was isolated using Trizol LS reagent (Invitrogen). The mRNA levels of circRBFOX2s in the streptavidin captured fractions were quantified by qRT–PCR and the enrichment ratios of the miR-1a-3p° or miR-206 to the miR-203 control were plotted.3. Results and discussion3.1. Overview of circular RNA deep sequencing dataIn recent years, a number of reports demonstrated that circRNAs were widespread and abundant existed in various eukaryotes, especially in mammals. However, little information is known regarding circRNAs in domestic animals with the exception of brain cortex of pig42 and mammary gland tissues of cattle.43 Here, we performed the genome-wide identification and potential function analysis of circRNAs in chickens. The total number of muscle fibers is the determining factor in muscle mass and this is regulated during embryogenesis or early post hatch in chickens.44,45 To identify the circRNA during the chicken embryonic skeletal muscle development, leg muscle tissues of two female XH chicken for each at days E11, E16 and P1 were used for RNA sequencing after rRNA-depletion and RNase R treatment (Supplementary Fig. S2). The sex of XH chicken embryos was identified (Supplementary Fig. S3A) and leg muscle tissues of female chickens were performed using hematoxylin-eosin (H-E) staining to visual the muscle fibers during 10 embryo age to post hatch (Supplementary Fig. S3B).For RNA-seq, a total of about 750 million reads were generated from all six samples, and each sample yielded more than 100 million reads. Raw data were processed to remove adapter and low quality sequences, and then mapped to the chicken reference genome (Gallus_gallus-4.0/galGal4) (Supplementary Table S2). The mapping reads were uniformly distributed in each chromosome, except the abundance in the chromosome MT is much larger than that of the other chromosomes (Fig. 1A).From the six muscle tissues, a total of 13,377 circRNAs were detected; 7,914 in E11, 10,949 in E16, and 9,309 in P1, and 5,176 were detected in all three stages (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table S3) using the CIRI algorithm method.41 These results agree with the scope and abundance of circRNAs that have been identified in mammals.18,21 According to their genomic locus, the chicken circRNAs were grouped as exon (including 5’UTR, 5’UTR-CDS, CDS-3’UTR, 3’UTR and 5’UTR -CDS-3’UTR), intron, exon-intron, intergenic regions or others. Although circRNAs can arise from almost any location in a genome, they are most originate from coding exons.13,17–19 We also found 11,064 of 13,377 circRNAs were derived from known chicken genes, especially in coding DNA sequences (CDS) (n = 8,110). The other circRNAs were derived from introns, exon-introns, intergenic regions or other regions (Fig. 1C). All these circRNAs were originated from 3,589 chicken genes. Among them, 1,555 parental genes generated only one circRNA, and the other genes could yield two or more circular isoforms, even smaller fractions yielded more than ten distinct circular isoforms (Fig. 1D), similar to the results in pigs.42Annotation of chicken embryonic muscle circRNA.

The number of circRNAs expressed at various cutoff expression levels in each sample are shown in Figure 1E and F. A total of 3,036 circRNAs were defined as highly expressed circRNA (BSRP > 1), and 2,579 of them were detected in the three developmental stages we examined (Fig. 1G). The 10 most abundant circRNAs expressed in embryonic muscle are listed in Table 1. The majority of highly expressed circRNAs was derived from exons and as a group was more abundant than other circRNA types (Fig. 1H).

Identification of differentially expressed circRNAsCircRNAs are usually expressed in tissue and developmental stage specific manners. Especially during embryonic development, circRNA expression levels exhibit dynamic global changes.17,42,46 To address the potential functions of circRNA, differentially-expressed circRNAs (DEcircRNAs) were identified by DEGseq analysis (fold change > 2, q-value < 0.05) and clustered based on their expression profiles (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S4). A total of 462 DEcircRNAs were detected in the three developmental groups, 236, 285 and 89 circRNAs in E11_VS_E16, E11_VS_P1, and E16_VS_P1 comparison groups, respectively. These circRNAs were more abundant in E16 and P1 than in E11, whereas a small fraction of group E11 was quantitatively higher (Fig. 2B, Supplementary Tables S4–S6). We found that 223, 526 and 255 circRNAs were specifically expressed in E11, E16 and P1, respectively (Fig. 2C). A larger number of circRNAs are differentially expressed in chicken leg muscle development. We performed RNA sequencing used two individuals in each stage but not mix RNA pool. The variation of circRNAs abundance was also existed between the two duplicates used for sequencing. The numbers of circRNAs were larger in E16 or P1 than that in E11 of leg muscle, consistent with that circRNAs were found to accumulate during aging in Drosophila heads.17Differentially expressed circRNAs in three different development stages of embryonic muscle.

The Y axis represents GO terms and the X axis represents –Log p-value.The biogenesis of circRNA can competes with pre-mRNA splicing, and intron or exon-intron circRNAs can regulate the transcription of their parental gene.23–25 In this study, we performed GO Enrichment Analysis for the parental genes of differentially-expressed circRNAs (fold change > 2, P-value < 0.05) in E11_VS_E16, E11_VS_P1 and E16_VS_P1 comparison groups (Supplementary Tables S7–S9). The parental gene functions were involved in muscle-related biological processes, including muscle structure development, muscle tissue development, muscle system processes and muscle cell differentiation (Fig. 2D–F). Using this data, we organized a functional network using Ingenuity pathway analysis (Supplementary Table S10). The most prevalent diseases and function interaction network was related to skeletal and muscular disorders and this group involved 29 parental genes (Supplementary Fig. S5).3.3. Putative functions of chicken circRNAs as miRNA spongesThe spatial-temporal grouping of circRNAs suggested that they are functional molecules. Since the discovery of CDR1as can serve as miR-7 sponges,13,14 there are growing evidences indicate that circRNAs can function as miRNA sponges or competing endogenous RNAs.17,47–51 However, unlike CDR1as contain multiple binding sites to sponge miR-7, most circRNAs bind more than one species of miRNA as was shown for circFOXO352 and circHIPK3.53 We identified the miRNA binding capabilities of our differentially expressed exonic circRNAs, and found that 946 of 1,401 exonic circRNAs harbored one or more miRNA binding site and involved 150 known miRNAs (The top 10 of these circRNAs were listed in Table 2). We used the 20 most abundant differentially expressed exonic circRNAs from each comparison group and matched them with their potential target miRNAs. These data were then used to construct an interactive network map (Fig. 3). We identified several miRNAs with key roles in skeletal muscle development and differentiation such as miR-1, miR-133, miR-206 and miR-203 in this network. The high abundance of these DEcircRNAs could be served as candidate circRNAs to further study in chicken skeletal muscle.

We identified 11 isoforms of RBFOX2 circRNAs (Fig. 4A) and six of them were expressed abundantly and differentially in muscle (Fig. 4B). Four isoforms circRBFOX2.2-3, 2-4, 2-6, and 2-9 harbored miR-1a-3p and miR-206 binding sites (Fig. 4C). The interaction of circRBFOX2s with miR-1a-3p and miR-206 was further validated in our study.

Experimental validation of chicken circRNAsThe expression and back-splicing sites of several circRNAs were validated by divergent reverse-transcription PCR, RNaseR digestion and qRT-PCR, according to previously described methodologies.13,54 Divergent primers and convergent primers were designed to amplify six candidate circRNAs in cDNA and genomic DNA samples. Divergent primers from each circRNA produced a single distinct band of the expected product size only in cDNA samples suggesting the presence of back-splicing junctions but not genomic rearrangements (Fig. 5A). PCR products of divergent primers were further detected by Sanger sequencing to confirm the back-splicing junctions (Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. S6). To detect the resistance of circRNA to the digestion by RNaseR, we quantified the six candidate circRNAs with RNaseR treatment compared to control by qRT-PCR. All tested circRNAs showed much more resistant than the linear mRNA control (Fig. 5C). In addition, the expression of six differentially expressed circRNAs was also validated by qRT-PCR in E11_VS_E16, E11_VS_P1, and E16_VS_P1 comparison groups. Except the expression of circRBFOX2.2-4 and circFGFR2.3-6 in P1 VS E16 compared group, the expression patterns of these circRNAs were consistent with the RNA-Seq results, indicating that the deep sequencing results were reliable (Fig. 5D).

CircRBFOX2 interacts with miR-206 and miR-1aTwo circular isoforms of RBFOX2 which we designated as circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 were derived from exon2-3 and exon 2-4 of RBFOX2, respectively. Both these molecules possessed miR-1a-3p and miR-206 binding sites (Fig. 6A and B). The prediction of a miRNA target site does not necessarily mean that a miRNA binds to that site. To further validate that these two circRBFOX2s can be interacted with miR-1a-3p and miR-206, we constructed two dual-luciferase reporters by inserting perfect miR-1a-3p or miR-206 target sites into the 3’ end of Renilla luciferase. The knockdown potential of the miRNA was assessed by the presence or absence of circRBFOX2s. After co-transfecting the dual-luciferase reporter with their corresponding miRNAs, the relative luminescence was significantly decreased compared with miR-NC. However, the relative luminescence returned when co-transfected with either circRBFOX2.2-3 or circRBFOX2.2-4 expression vectors, but not the mutated vectors of circRBFOX2s (Fig. 6C and D). These results demonstrated that the knockdown potential of miR-1a-3p or miR-206 was significantly diminished in the presence of circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4. Immunoprecipitation of AGO2 from myoblasts co-transfected with miR-1a-3p, miR-206 or miR-203 and circRBFOX2 overexpression vector was performed and the circRNA levels were quantified by qRT–PCR and normalized to GAPDH (Fig. 6A). Compared with miR-203 transfected cells, immunoprecipitation of AGO2 from miR-1a-3p or miR-206 transfected cells were both resulted in an enrichment of circRBFOX2. In addition, compared with miR-203 control, circRBFOX2.2-4 was specifically captured by both 3-biotinylated miR-1a-3p and miR-206, and circRBFOX2.2-3 was also captured by 3-biotinylated miR-206. Together, these results suggested that circRBFOX2s are able to interact with miR-1a-3p and miR-206. CircRBFOX2s interacted with miR-206 and miR-1a-3p.

Effects of circRBFOX2 on expression of miRNAs and their target genesWe over expressed or knocked down circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 in chicken primary myoblast, and then measured miR-1°-3p and miR-206 expression levels by qRT-PCR. We constructed the pcDNA3.1 vector with linear exon2-3 or exon2-4 of RBFOX2 as control, which give rise to linear RBFOX2 products. We transfected these linear control vector in myoblast and then the miR-206/miR-1a-3p level were quantified by qRT-PCR. The results showed that linear RBFOX2 did not affect the expression of miR-206 and miR-1a-3p (Fig. 7A). Effects of circRBFOX2 on expression of miRNAs and their target gene.

Student’s t test (two-tailed) was performed for data analysis. *P < 0.05; **P < 0.01.Compared to empty vector control, overexpressed circRBFOX2.2-3 or circRBFOX2.2-4 inhibited both miR-1a-3p and miR-206, while the mutation of circRBFOX2 vector did not have significant change (Fig. 7B). Furthermore, the expression level of miR-206/miR-1a-3p tend to be lower when the level of circRBFOX2s higher (Fig. 7C). We knock down circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 using siRNAs, and the results showed that the siRNAs could knockdown the circRBFOX2s but not linear RBFOX2. Knockdown of either circRBFOX2.2-3 or circRBFOX2.2-4 increased both the expression of miR-1a-3p and miR-206 (Fig. 7D). Northern blot analysis for miR-206 was also confirmed that the miR-206 expression level was increased by knockdown of circRBFOX2s (Fig. 7H). The expression of miR-203 used as control did not affect by neither overexpressed nor knockdown of circRBFOX2s. Together, our results found that circRBFOX2s downregulated the expression of miR-1a-3p and miR-206. This finding was not consisted with the standard model of circRNA miRNA sponge. The circRNAs that act as miRNA sponge can sequesters the miRNA away from other targets, but does not necessarily alter the expression of the miRNA. Recently, there are some circRNAs, such as CircRar1, circ-ABCB10 and hsa-circ-0016347 were also reported to downregulated the expression of their target miRNA.55–57 However, the exact mechanism for this association is unknown, probably upregulation of circRNAs might degrade miRNA expression.We further validated whether circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 regulated the target gene of miR-206. According to previous studies and predicted by Targetsclan (http://www.targetscan.org/vert_71/ (16 September 2017, date last accessed)), we chose the CCND1, CCND2, PAX3 and HDAC4 as candidate target gene for miR-206, and then verified their relations by luciferase assay.58–60 The CCND2 and HDAC4 were confirmed as the target gene of miR-206 (Fig. 7A). Thus, we further determine their expression level after overexpression/knockdown of circRBFOX2s in myoblast. The results showed that both circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 upregulated the mRNA level of CCND2 but not HDAC4 (Fig. 7F and G).3.7. Effects of circRBFOX2 and miR-206 on myoblast proliferationTo observe the functions of circRBFOX2.2-3 or circRBFOX2.2-4 on myoblast, we over expressed and knocked down the circRBFOX2.2-3 or circRBFOX2.2-4 by transfected with overexpression vector or siRNAs. Overexpression of either circRBFOX2.2-3 or circRBFOX2.2-4 resulted in increased levels of circRBFOX2.2-3 or circRBFOX2.2-4 above that of the empty vector control (Fig. 8A and B). Similarly, when we transfected circRBFOX2.2-3 or circRBFOX2.2-4 siRNAs, the transcript levels of both these RNAs decreased (Fig. 8C and D). These results indicated that our expression system worked in myoblasts. We used flow cytometry for cell cycle analysis of transfected myoblasts. Overexpression of circRBFOX2.2-3 resulted in a greater number of S-phase cells than controls, and fewer G0/G1 cells (Fig. 8E and F, Supplementary Figs S7 and S8). Both the mutated vector of circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 did not affect the cell cycle of myoblast. Knockdown of circRBFOX2.2-3 resulted in a greater number of G0/G1 cells and fewer S and G2/M phase cells than controls. However, the circRBFOX2.2-4 knockdown and overexpression groups showed significant differences only in S-phase (Fig. 8E and F, Supplementary Figs S7 and S8). The 5-Ethynyl-2’-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation assays were also performed after over expressed and knocked down the circRBFOX2.2-3 or circRBFOX2.2-4 in myoblast. The number of EdU-stained cells increased in both the circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 overexpression groups. In contrast, proliferation decreased when circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 were knocked down (Fig. 8G and H). Chicken circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 regulate QM-7 cell proliferation.

We overexpressed and knocked down miR-206 by transfecting myoblasts with a miR-206 mimic or anti-miR-206 (Fig. 9A and B). Myoblasts transfected with the miR-206 mimic decreased the number of S-phase cells compared with the scrambled negative control group (Fig. 9C). Conversely, S-phase cells in the anti-miR-206 group were significantly increased (Fig. 9D). Consistent with the result of cell cycle analysis, EdU incorporation indicated that myoblast proliferation was suppressed by miR-206 overexpression and increased by miR-206 knockdown (Fig. 9A and F). Interestingly, the effects of miR-206 on myoblast proliferation was impaired when either circRBFOX2.2-3 or circRBFOX2.2-4 vectors were co-transfected (Fig. 9E and F). Together, these data implied that miR-206 could suppress myoblast proliferation, whereas circRBFOX2.2-3 and circRBFOX2.2-4 can promote myoblast proliferation, and antagonize the functions of miR-206 in myoblasts. Our results support previous findings that circRNAs sequester miRNAs to suppress their functions in chickens. Nevertheless, only a few circRNAs that function in this manner have been described. Some reports argue that most circRNAs do not function as miRNA sponges in human and mouse.20,61,62 Whether this mechanism is a common theme in circRNA biology awaits future research. The effect of miR-206 on QM-7 cell proliferation was rescued by circRBFOX2s.

Most of the exonic circRNAs harbored miRNA binding sites and could play key roles in embryonic muscle development through sequestering miRNAs as well as other functions.We thank Prof. Zhang’s lab members for helpful discussions and the SCAU chicken farm for providing breeding eggs.Accession numbersRNA-seq data are available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with accession number (GSE89355).Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.FundingThis research was supported by the Natural Scientific Foundation of China (31472090), the China Agriculture Research System (CARS-41-G03), and the Foundation for High-level Talents in Higher Education in Guangdong, China.Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary data"

IntroductionThe fungal family Botryosphaeriaceae (Ascomycetes) includes saprobes, endophytes and phytopathogens.1–4 Members of this family are among the most widely geographically distributed opportunistic plant pathogens4 with an extensive host range, infecting many economically important plants worldwide.1–5 These pathogens can establish successful infections via wounds or natural openings, such as lenticels and stomata.2,3 Once inside the host tissues, they may remain latent, live as endophytes and then shift into pathogens when the host is stressed. Hence, taxa in this family have been described as latent pathogens or plant opportunistic fungal pathogens.4,5 These pathogens can cause serious diseases, such as dieback, cankers, shoot blights, leaf spots, fruit and seed rots, and witches’ brooms, in a broad range of woody plants.1,2,5 This shift from an endophyte to a pathogen is related to host biochemical and epigenetic changes in response to environmental stresses.4,5Among the currently accepted 23 genera of Botryosphaeriaceae, Botryosphaeria Ces. & De Not., Diplodia Fr., Lasiodiplodia Ellis & Everh. and Neofusicoccum Crous, Slippers & A.J.L. Phillips are considered the most virulent.1,2 These botryosphaeriaceous pathogens attack the perennial organs of important woody plants, including apples, eucalyptus, grapes, peaches, pears and poplars, compromising the translocation of water and nutrients, and ultimately leading to death.3,5 To establish a successful infection, these woody pathogens overcome both preformed and inducible host defences by producing enzymes and/or toxins.5–10 During the last decade, several studies have confirmed the functions and effects of virulence factors, such as cell wall–degrading enzymes, effectors, secreted proteins and phytotoxins of these pathogens on their hosts.3–11 For example, most of these botryosphaeriaceous pathogens produce a wide array of secreted proteins that target the components in the primary and secondary cell walls of plants, such as endo-ß-1,4-cellulases [glycosyl hydrolase family 5 (GH5)], ß-glucosidases (GH3), xyloglucan transglucosylase/hydrolases (GH16) and ß-xylosidases (GH43).3,5,7 These glycosyl hydrolase family proteins assist in the hydrolysis of glycosidic bonds in complex sugars and are involved in diverse functions, including the degradation of biomass, antibacterial defence strategies, pathogenesis mechanisms and a few typical cellular functions.12,13 Even though this knowledge can be used to identify proteins related to pathogenesis and virulence, a better understanding of their potential virulence functions is required to develop effective disease management strategies.Although many genomic and transcriptomic studies have been conducted for different phytopathogens, only a few have focused on botryosphaeriaceous pathogens. These genomic studies, combined with transcriptome analyses, have significantly advanced our knowledge on the pathogenesis of these organisms. Recent studies on common botryosphaeriaceous woody plant pathogens have presented draft genomes for Diplodia sapinea,14,Diplodia seriata3 and Neofusicoccum parvum.11 Functional annotation of sequenced genomes has provided a wide range of potential virulence factors, many of which are associated with lignocellulose degradation, host colonization, cellular transporters, nutrient uptake, secondary metabolism and toxin production. Some of the virulence genes predicted by Morales-Cruz et al.3 and Paolinelli-Alfonso et al.5 have been identified as virulence factors in other fungal pathogens, such as Eutypa lata, Phaeoacremonium aleophilum, Phytophthora sp. and Togninia minima.11,15,16 Although single-genome analysis facilitates better insights into the biology of a pathogen, comparative analysis of multiple genomes can often reveal a significantly greater amount of information on the physiology and evolution of a pathogen.17 Indeed, comparative genomic analyses of related taxa have facilitated the identification of both unique and shared genes and pathways related to virulence in fungal pathogens.In this study, we sequenced and analysed the genomes of three botryosphaeriaceous pathogens, Botryosphaeria dothidea, Lasiodiplodia theobromae and N.parvum. Of these, L. theobromae has been recorded as the most virulent on grapes in China. Compared with L. theobromae, N. parvum and B. dothidea are considered to be mildly virulent and weakly virulent, respectively, on grapes in China.2 The main objectives of this study were to (i) identify the genomic characteristics of these fungi, (ii) understand the genetic variation among the sequenced species and genera, (iii) identify genes or gene families involved in virulence, with a special focus on genes that are unique to each of these genera, as well as those shared among these genera, and (iv) understand the opportunistic infections identified in these genera. Whole-genome, transcriptome and comparative genome analyses revealed that their genomes encode a diverse range of genes related to virulence, including carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes), peroxidases, cytochrome P450s, effector proteins, transcription factor genes and genes involved in secondary metabolism. Our analyses identified obvious expansion of gene families related to transporters and the synthesis of secondary metabolites in Botryosphaeriaceae. We also identified different infection strategies utilized by L. theobromae to adapt to different lifestyles. Functional characterization of several genes confirmed their roles in pathogenicity as candidate virulence factors. Our study provides a solid foundation from which to explore the molecular processes responsible for virulence in L. theobromae as well as in other botryosphaeriaceous taxa.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strains, culture conditions and DNA isolationFungal strains were collected from Vitis vinifera in different provinces and used for sequencing (see Supplementary Table S1). The strains were deposited at the Beijing Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, China. Cultures were grown in potato dextrose agar (PDA: 200 g potato, 20 g dextrose and 20 g agar) medium at 28 °C and stored at -80 °C. Total DNA was isolated from the collected mycelium using the Cetyltrimethylammonium bromide method.182.2. Genome sequencing and assemblyThe genomic DNA of L.theobromae CSS-01s was sequenced with the Illumina platforms at the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) in Shenzhen, China, and a 500-bp paired-end DNA library and a 6-kb mate-pair DNA library were constructed. Data from the Illumina libraries were first filtered by removing low-quality sequences, base-calling duplicates and adaptor contamination. A total of 3.1 Gb of paired-end reads, with an average read length of 90 bp and a sequencing coverage of approximately 90×, was achieved for L. theobromae strain CSS-01s. The genome sequence was assembled using SOAPdenovo software. First, short reads from the paired-end library (500 bp) were assembled into contigs using sequence overlap information. Then, information from the mate-pair library was used to join the contigs into scaffolds. Finally, SOAP Gapcloser version 1.12 (http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapdenovo.html (10 May 2016, date last accessed)) was used to close the gaps inside the scaffolds.Two other botryosphaeriaceous taxa (B. dothidea and N. parvum) with two isolates for each species and another L. theobromae isolate (Supplementary Table S1) were subjected to low-depth sequencing. Genomic DNA extracted from all of the above isolates was sequenced using Solexa sequencing technology (Beijing Novo Gene Bioinformatics Technology Co., Ltd, Beijing, China). These libraries, with 500-bp inserts, were assembled using SOAPdenovo software (Supplementary Table S2).2.3. Transcriptome sequencing and analysesLasiodiplodia theobromae conidial suspension (1 ml, 1 × 105 conidial·ml-1) was inoculated onto the 27 wounded stems of V.vinifera var. Summer Black and maintained at two temperatures (25 °C and 35 °C) for 48 h in the green house at Beijing Academy of Agricultural and Forestry Sciences, Beijing, China. Wounded stems inoculated with sterile water were maintained as controls at the same conditions. Simultaneously, L. theobromae cultures were maintained on PDA at same conditions. Then, infected host and fungal samples were collected from hosts at 8- and 12-h post-inoculation (hpi) at 25 °C. Simultaneously, fungal mycelia were collected from PDA at 8- and 12-h post-culturing at both temperatures. All the collected samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and then stored at -70 °C for RNA isolation. Total RNA was isolated from in vitro cultures and from diseased samples using Trizol according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Invitrogen, USA). Total RNA from nine stems with three biological replicates for each sample at 8 and 12 hpi were used for library construction. All procedures including mRNA purification, cDNA preparation, end repair of cDNA, adapter ligation and cDNA amplification were carried out by following Novo gene company methodologies for preparing Illumina RNASeq libraries. The paired-end reads with 150 bp were generated via Illumina HiSeq™ by Novogene company. All the sequence data were filtered to remove adaptor sequences and low-quality sequences. The quality trimmed reads were mapped to L. theobromae genome using Botwie2, allowing up to two base mismatches per read. The reads per kb per million reads was calculated to reflect the expression level. The differentially expressed analysis was done by DESeq and DEGseq software. In addition, RNASeq data assembled by Trinity were used to confirm the completeness of the draft genome of L. theobromae strain CSS-01s. RNASeq reads were assembled into 24,537 contigs longer than 300 bp, and all the contigs were then searched using blast against the L. theobromae genome.2.4. Annotation of repetitive elementsThe Tandem Repeats Finder19 was used to search for tandem repeats in the L. theobromae genome. Transposable elements were predicted by combining the results from RepeatMasker (version 4.0), RepeatProteinMasker (version 4.0) and RepeatModeler version (1.0.4).20 Homology-based discovery of transposable elements was conducted by RepeatMasker and RepeatProteinMasker against the sequences in the RepBase database version 19.10 (RM database version 20140131). RepeatModeler integrated two de novo repeat finding programs, RECON (version 1.08)21 and RepeatScout (version 1.0.5),20 to identify repeat element boundaries and family relationships from the sequence data.2.5. Annotation of protein-coding genesProtein-coding genes in L. theobromae strain CSS-01s were identified by integrating ab initio prediction with homology-based gene prediction and transcriptome sequencing approaches. Repeat sequences were masked throughout the genome by RepeatModeler and RepeatMasker. Then, gene models were predicted from these repeat-masked genomes using three ab initio predictors, Augustus (version 3.0.3),22 SNAP23 and GeneMark-ES (version 2.3f)24. The accuracy of the ab initio annotation was improved using the proteomes of ten other fungi (Alternaria brassicicola, Aspergillus fumigatus, Blumeria graminis, Colletotrichum graminicola, C. higginsianum, Fusarium graminearum, Neurospora crassa, Pyricularia oryzae, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe) and the RNASeq data. These 10 downloaded fungal proteomes were aligned to the L. theobromae genome by genBlastA (version 1.0.4). Proteins with more than 70% sequence identity were used as templates to predict the gene structure of L. theobromae with Genewise (version 2.4.1).25 Then, predicted genes with incomplete open reading frames were removed. The RNASeq data were aligned to the L. theobromae genome by TopHat (version 2.0.11),26 and potential transcripts in the L. theobromae genome were predicted using Cufflinks (version 2.2.1).27 TransDecoder (version 2.0.1) was used to identify candidate coding regions within the predicted transcript sequences. Finally, all the outputs of the above methods were converted to Gene Finding Format (GFF) files with local PERL scripts. The resultant GFF files from each of the prediction programs were used as inputs into the EVM (version 2012-06-25) program to integrate GFF files obtained from the three gene prediction methods. Homology gene prediction was used to predict genes in five other sequenced botryosphaeriaceous taxa as listed in Supplementary Table S1, using the predicted genes of L. theobromae CSS-01s as templates.2.6. Functional annotation of predicted genesBasic functional annotations of all predicted proteins were searched against the NCBI non-redundant sequence database and UniProt/Swiss-Prot databases under the threshold parameter of E-value cut-off =1e-5. Secreted proteins were predicted using a combination of tools. Potential secreted proteins should contain a signal peptide without any transmembrane domain. The availability of a secretion signal peptide evaluated by both SignalP (version 4.1)28 and TargetP (version 1.1),29 and the unavailability of a transmembrane domain predicted by TMHMM (version 2.0)30 were used to define potential secreted proteins. SignalP predicts the presence of signal peptide cleavage sites and their locations in the amino acid sequence. TargetP predicts the subcellular location of eukaryotic proteins based on the predicted presence of any N-terminal pre-sequences such as chloroplast transit peptides, mitochondrial targeting peptides or secretory pathway signal peptides. Among the predicted secretory proteins, secreted proteins =400 amino-acids in size and with =4 cysteine residues were defined as putative effectors.Searches against the protein family database PFAM and Gene Ontology (GO) annotation of each genome were performed using InterProScan (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/pfa/iprscan5/ (1 June 2016, date last accessed)) analysis. Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) annotation was performed to assign molecular interaction networks and metabolic pathways using the online KEGG Automatic Annotation Server (KAAS) (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/kaas/ (1 June 2016, date last accessed)). The transcription factors in the genome were annotated by mapping the IPRSCAN terms to the Fungal Transcription Factor database (http://ftfd.snu.ac.kr/tf.php?a=interpro (10 June 2016, date last accessed)), and transporters were annotated by searching against the TCDB database.The family-specific HMM profiles of CAZymes were downloaded from the dbCAN database, and the hmmscan program in the HMMER 3.0 package31 was used to search the fungal proteomes against the downloaded HMM profiles. Then, the primary results were parsed by the hmmscan-parser scripts supplied by the dbCAN database.2.7. Comparative genomicsThe protein sequences of the L. theobromae CSS-01s genome were compared with the protein sequences of 10 other fungi genomes, including five pathogenic taxa (Blumeria graminis, Colletotrichum graminicola, C. higginsianum, F.graminearum and P.oryzae), two opportunistic pathogens (A.brassicicola and A.fumigatus) and three non-pathogenic fungi (N.crassa, S.cerevisiae and S.pombe), as well as five other isolates of the Botryosphaeriaceae family.32,33 OrthoMCL (version 2.0)34 was used to find the orthologues, co-orthologues and in-paralogue pairs (Supplementary Table S3), as well as reciprocal best hits for each proteome. The tools were executed with an E-value <10-5 with the All-versus-All BLASTP search and the inflation parameter 2.0 in the MCL algorithm.2.8. Ka/Ks calculationFor Ka/Ks calculation, 1:1 orthologous genes were identified among each isolate pair of each Botryosphaeriaceae species. Subsequently, the proteins between the two isolates were aligned in MUSCLE (version 3.8) using the default parameters and then converted to the corresponding nucleotide sequence alignment. The FASTA files containing the aligned sequences were converted into AXT files by a local PERL script, and the ratios of Ka and Ks were calculated between orthologous coding regions with Ka/Ks_Calculator v2.0 using a maximum-likelihood YN model.2.9. Divergence time estimateOrthoMCL was used to identify 1,029 single-copy gene families. The proteins of these single-copy gene families were aligned using MAFFT (version 7.187) with the default parameters and then converted to the corresponding nucleotide sequence alignment. A phylogenomic tree was constructed using MEGA7 based on the concatenated alignments of these 1,029 single-copy orthologous families. The phylogenomic tree consists of 15 other fungal taxa including eight pathogenic taxa (Blumeria graminis, Botrytis cinera, Colletotrichum graminicola, C. higginsianum, D.seriata, E.lata, Fusarium graminearum and Pyricularia oryzae), three opportunistic pathogens (Alternaria alternata, Alternaria brassicicola and Aspergillus fumigatus) and three non-pathogenic fungi (Neurospora crassa, Saccharomyces cerevisiae and S.pombe), as well as five other isolates of the Botryosphaeriaceae family. Bootstrap support for internal branches was evaluated from 1,000 full heuristic searches. Divergence times between species were calculated using the MCMC tree program in the PAML.2.10. Functional studies on putative effector proteinsTo understand the functions of these putative effector genes identified from the current study, 27 randomly selected effectors, of which 18 are specific, were translocated into plant cells to identify effectors that suppress hypersensitive responses (HRs) in the host. These putative effector genes (without signal peptide regions) of Botryosphaeriaceae were amplified using the primer sets listed in Supplementary Table S4. The PCR products were digested with the corresponding restriction enzymes and subcloned into effector detector vector (pEDV).35,Burkholderia glumae competent cells were prepared as described, with minor modifications.36 Each pEDV construct was transformed into B. glumae using electroporation (Bio-Rad MicroPulserTM). Transformed strains were spread on LB agar medium containing 25 mg·l-1 gentamycin. At least four glycerol stocks were prepared for each transformant and stored at -80 °C for further use. Leaves of 4-week-old Nicotiana benthamiana plants were infiltrated with bacterial inocula of OD600=0.1 using a 1 ml needleless syringe. A half-section of each leaf was injected with B. glumae containing the pEDV empty vector, and the other half-section was injected with B. glumae containing the effector gene construct. Plants were maintained at 25 °C. The timing of the hyposensitive responses was recorded at 2 days post-inoculation.2.11. Functional studies on putative lignocellulase encoding genesMaximum parsimony analysis was conducted for all the annotated glycosyl hydrolase family genes in PAUP (phylogenetic analysis using parsimony) v.4.0b1037 using heuristic search option with tree bisection–reconnection branch swapping and 1,000 random sequence additions. The full-length coding sequences of candidate genes were isolated by PCR using the specific primers listed in Supplementary Table S4. The PCR products were digested with HindIII and EcoRI and inserted into the same sites behind the PtrpC promoter in a modified pBluescript II KS vector. The wild-type isolate, CSS-01s, was cultured at 28 °C on PDA plates. Mycelia collected from the culture were used to isolate fungal genomic DNA and protoplasts. Protoplasts were isolated and transformed using the PEG/CaCl2 method.38 Selection medium was supplemented with 1,100 µg/ml neomycin (Amresco, USA) to screen for neomycin-resistant transformants. Putative overexpression mutants were identified by PCR and further confirmed by qRT-PCR. Pathogenicity tests were conducted on detached ‘Summer Black’ grape shoots as described previously.2 The inoculated shoots were maintained on an alternating dark/light cycle under moist conditions in the greenhouse for 8–10 days at 25 °C. All treatments were performed with at least five replicates, and all experiments were repeated three times. Data were analysed by Student’s t-test using SAS software.3. Results3.1. Genome sequencing, assembly and annotationThe genome of the highly virulent L.theobromae strain CSS-01s (as shown in Fig. 1A) was assembled using sequencing data generated by Illumina technology (Supplementary Table S2). Approximately 342 million Illumina reads (~90× coverage of the genome) were used for assembly in SOAPdenovo software, resulting in a genome sequence of 43.3 Mb. The assembled genome accounts for 95.7% of the total genome size (~45.2 Mb), as estimated by JELLYFISH (Supplementary Fig. S1).39 The current genome assembly of L. theobromae strain CSS-01s consists of 29 scaffolds (= 1 kb) and 60 contigs with N50 lengths of 4.7 and 1.7 Mb, respectively. The overall GC content of the L. theobromae genome is approximately 54.77%. Furthermore, all RNASeq reads were assembled into 24,210 contigs longer than 300 bp, and 95.8% of these aligned with the predicted gene models, confirming the completeness and accuracy of the genome assembly. Compared with the virulence of L. theobromae, N.parvum and B.dothidea were mildly virulent and weakly virulent, respectively, in China (Fig. 1A). The genome assembly results for all botryosphaeriaceous isolates are shown in Table 1.

The red dots are the fossil calibrations from the Time Tree database.Integrated data from the ab initio prediction, homology-based search and RNASeq facilitated the prediction of 12,902 high-confidence protein-coding genes in L. theobromae (CSS-01s), with an average sequence length of 1,629 bp. The number of predicted genes in the L. theobromae genome is similar to those in other fungal genomes (Supplementary Table S5). On average, each predicted gene contains 2.8 exons, with 9,902 of the predicted genes containing introns. The coding regions of these predicted genes constitute 43.6% of the genome. The genomic features for L. theobromae CSS-01s is shown in Table 2. The genome features of the other five Botryosphaeriaceae isolates are shown in Supplementary Table S6. Genome features of L. theobromae CSS-01SGenome features of L. theobromae CSS-01SThe predicted genes were further annotated based on comparisons with several databases, as indicated in Supplementary Table S7. An interproScan analysis identified 7,733 proteins belonging to 3,570 protein families in L. theobromae. Functional annotation showed that among the 12,902 predicted genes, 7,149 (55.4%) could be assigned with GO terms (Supplementary Fig. 2), and 5,520 genes could be mapped to the KEGG pathway database. Our analyses predicted 937 secreted proteins, accounting for 6.9% of the proteome, with 359 proteins identified as potential effectors. Similar numbers of secreted proteins were found in D.seriata3 (910) and N.parvum11 (1097). However, the corresponding number of secreted proteins found in the Pyricularia oryzae32 (739), Valsa mali40 (782) and V. pyri40 (774) genomes were lower than that of L. theobromae. Of all the secreted proteins identified, 269 (including 101 potential effectors) were specific to L. theobromae. Among the protein-coding genes revealed by the different annotation systems, the major functional groups in L. theobromae include degrading CAZymes (820 genes, of which 198 are specific to L. theobromae), cellular transporters (2,419 genes, of which 307 are specific), transcription factors (528 genes, of which 118 are specific) and secondary metabolites (54 genes, none were specific) (see Fig. 2C and D). Genome synteny analysis revealed an overall correlation between the homologous chromosomes of the six isolates (Supplementary Fig. S3). Repetitive elements identified in this study are shown in Supplementary Table S8. Overview of the gene family size comparison between the L. theobromae (CSS-01s) and other fungi.

Selection pressures on orthologues of L. theobromae and other botryosphaeriaceous isolatesAdaptive evolution is often associated with changes in protein-coding genes in the genome41, and the Ka/Ks ratio is commonly used to reveal the direction and magnitude of selection upon these genes. Among the orthologous pairs between the L. theobromae strains, there were significant divergences for 809 orthologues. The Ka and Ks rates as well as their ratios were all calculated (Supplementary Fig. S4). Among these, four pairs of orthologues have Ka/Ks ratios > 1, and 13 have Ka/Ks rates ranging from 0.5 to 1. The Ka/Ks ratios between L. theobromae CSS-01s and the four other isolates of botryosphaeriaceous taxa are listed in Supplementary Table S9. Orthologous pairs with a Ka/Ks value > 1 indicate positive selection, whereas Ka/Ks value between 0.5 and 1 indicate weak purifying selection. Interestingly, all four genes (evm.model.scaffold_15.78, evm.model.scaffold_4.947, evm.model.scaffold_9.354 and evm.model.scaffold_9.168) showing positive selection were newly discovered genes with unknown functions. However, two of the genes have similar sequences in N. parvum11 and Macrophoma phaseolina42. The similar gene found in N. parvum contains a W40 domain with a wide variety of functions involved in regulatory modules in signal transduction, pre-mRNA processing and cytoskeleton assembly.113.3. Comparative genomics and evolutionComparative genomics revealed a broad range of gene families available in the genome with potential functions related to virulence. In addition to the six botryosphaeriaceous isolates sequenced in this study, 15 other fungal genomes were also included for comparative analyses.32,33 These taxa includes pathogens, opportunistic pathogens and non-pathogenic fungi. According to the analysis, these species shared 1,029 single-copy orthologous groups. Phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 1B) revealed that the species belonging to Botryosphaeriaceae are more closely related to A. brassicicola and A. alternata, than to the other taxa. This is acceptable, because they all belong to the same class, Dothideomycetes. When compared with all other genomes, 2,813 gene families containing 1,129 species-specific groups (1,156 genes) were found to be specific to Botryosphaeriaceae, most of which were single-copy genes (Fig. 2A and B). These genes are enriched in cytochrome P450s and GO functional categories, such as hydrolase activity, lyase activity, metabolic processes, oxidation-reduction processes, oxidoreductase activity, iron ion binding, heme binding and transporter activity (FDR <0.05, Supplementary Table S10).Based on their lifestyles, botryosphaeriaceous taxa share 221 unique orthologous gene families with pathogenic fungi, 1,049 with opportunistic fungal pathogens and 36 with non-pathogenic fungi (Fig. 2A and B). Orthologous families shared between pathogenic fungi and Botryosphaeriaceae are enriched in phosphorylation, signal transduction and enzyme inhibitor activity functions (FDR <0.05, Supplementary Table S11), whereas no significant functional enrichment was found in the gene families shared between the non-pathogenic taxa and botryosphaeriaceous taxa. Among all other fungal groups, Botryosphaeriaceae taxa shared the most orthologous gene families (1,049) with opportunistic fungal pathogens (Fig. 2A and B), with enriched hydrolase, catalytic, cellulose binding, oxidoreductase, transmembrane transporter, and transcription factor activities, among many others (FDR <0.05, see Supplementary Table S12). These genes are mainly involved in the metabolism of starch, sucrose, fructose and mannose, as well as secondary metabolite synthesis.3.4. Gene family expansions and contractionsThe expansion of gene families in fungal genomes is mainly associated with host adaptations5,43 and functions linked to virulence, such as host cell wall degradation, transport functions and secondary metabolite synthesis.5,44 This study used the Computational Analysis of gene Family Evolution (CAFÉ)45 program to identify gene families that have potentially undergone significant expansions or contractions in botryosphaeriaceous taxa. When compared with all other fungal genomes analysed in this study, five gene families (51 genes) in L. theobromae have significantly expanded (P =0.05, Supplementary Table S13), whereas one family has contracted. According to Clusters of Orthologous Group (COG) annotation, these expanded gene families in botryosphaeriaceous taxa are functionally related to secondary metabolism, plant cell wall degradation and cellular transporters such as non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), cytochrome P450, polyketide synthase (PKS), ATP-binding cassette (ABC)–type multidrug transport system, ATPase component, and sulphite reductase and alpha subunit (flavoprotein).3.5. Secondary metabolism genesSecondary metabolites are believed to be involved in the development of certain disease symptoms and, in some cases, cause the host to die.5,6,46 Genes encoding a biosynthetic pathway are co-regulated at the transcriptional level and are often physically clustered on fungal chromosomes.46 A biosynthetic gene is often surrounded by genes encoding transporters and others involved in post-synthesis modification of the metabolite.46,47 In this study, two computational programs, SMURF (http://jcvi.org/smurf/index.php (20 June 2016, date last accessed))48 and antiSAMSH (http://antismash.secondarymetabolites.org/ (20 June 2016, date last accessed)),49 were used to identify genes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. The L. theobromae genome contains a total of 58 secondary metabolite gene clusters, categorized into eight main groups. The majority of the clusters belong to type 1 polyketide synthases (t1 PKS, 11 clusters), followed by 12 non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), 10 terpene synthases, four non-ribosomal peptide synthetase–t1 PKS hybrids, three putative fatty acid clusters, a type 1 PKS-non-ribosomal peptide synthetase hybrid, a non-ribosomal peptide synthetase–putative fatty acid hybrid and another putative saccharide cluster. In addition to these eight known clusters, there were nine other clusters encoding secondary metabolite related proteins.3.6. Host-pathogen interactions revealed during infectionA comprehensive understanding of the L. theobromae transcriptome should significantly facilitate the discovery of new genes and their expression profiles. To understand pathogenicity-related genes, the transcript profiles of L. theobromae in V.vinifera were analysed at two early infection stages (Fig. 3A). When compared with axenic cultures, 75 and 283 genes were up-regulated, whereas 89 and 232 genes were down-regulated, at 8 and 12 hpi, respectively (Fig. 3C). During the early infection stages of L. theobromae, a total of 285 up-regulated genes and 243 down-regulated genes were identified. Among these genes, genes that exhibited significant expression during infection are listed in Supplementary Tables S14 and S15. According to GO enrichment analysis, the up-regulated genes at 8 hpi were enriched in molecular function and biological process terms, concentrated in ferric iron binding, the hydrolysis of O-glycosyl compounds and polygalacturonase activity. However, more genes were up-regulated at 12 hpi than at 8 hpi. At 12 hpi, most of the up-regulated genes were involved in pectin degradation, polygalacturonase activities and carbohydrate catabolic processes. This finding indicates that during infection, these up-regulated genes facilitate the degradation of cell walls by L. theobromae. KEGG pathway analysis confirmed that the genes up-regulated at 8 and 12 hpi were significantly enriched in starch and sucrose metabolism pathways, as well as in the pentose and glucuronate interconversion pathways.

L indicates samples collected from axenic cultures, M indicates samples of fungus and host tissues. Two different temperatures of 25 °C and 35 °C indicated by numbers 25 and 35. Two sample collection time points were indicated by 8 and 12 hpi.From a total of 75 genes up-regulated at 8 hpi, 40 were secreted proteins, of which 20 were predicted to be putative effectors. Among the 283 up-regulated genes at 12 hpi, 119 were secreted proteins, of which 51 were predicted to be putative effectors. These putative effectors contain conserved functional domains such as glycoside hydrolase, pectate lyase or fungal-specific extracellular EGF-like domains (CFEM) to enhance their invasion and pathogenesis. Unlike in other pathogenic taxa,42 secondary metabolism genes were not up-regulated at both 8 and 12 hpi.3.7. Expansion and expression of membrane transportersAmong the wide array of membrane transporters, two main families are abundant in fungal genomes, the ABC family and the major facilitator super (MFS) family.50 The L. theobromae genome encodes 917 membrane transporters. Searches against the transporter classification database confirm that L. theobromae has the largest number of membrane transporters compared with the other taxa (Supplementary Table S16). The number of membrane transporters in the L. theobromae genome is similar to that in A. fumigatus. Several membrane transporters in the L. theobromae genome are significantly expanded, including amino acid/choline transporters, anion:cation symporters, sugar porters, drug:H+ antiporter-2, multidrug resistance exporters (a.k.a. ABCB) and the pleiotropic drug resistance (PDR) transporters (Fig. 4A). Upon host contact, 17 membrane transporters were significantly up-regulated, including amino acid transporters, PDRs, sugar porters and triose-phosphate transporters. The multidrug resistance proteins in the PDR family confer resistance to cycloheximide and antifungal agents such as azoles and terbinafine51, and both were up-regulated. Two genes in the sugar porter family were significantly up-regulated; one of the two genes is a glucose/xylose: H+ symporter and the other is an MFS permease. These sugar transporters may allow the fungus to grow under different pH conditions.52Gene family expansions and contractions of L. theobromae, and up-regulation of gene expressions during infection.

Lasiodiplodia theobromae secretomeProteins secreted by pathogenic fungi are essential for host–pathogen interactions, including the successful establishment of infections.53 Therefore, identification and functional annotation of the secretome is important for identifying potential virulence factors. The L. theobromae genome encodes a total of 937 secreted proteins, accounting for 7.2% of its proteome, as predicted by SignalP-4.1,28 TargetP-1.1,54 and TMHMM-2.0.55 Among the secreted proteins identified, 417 were assigned with GO terms. Among the 283 genes up-regulated during infection, 105 are secreted proteins. Functional enrichment analysis showed that proteins involved in carbohydrate metabolism are significantly overrepresented in the up-regulated L. theobromae secretome (Supplementary Table S17).3.9. Prediction of putative effectors and their roles in suppressing HRsPlant pathogenic fungi secrete effectors that suppress the first layer of inducible defences, known as pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) triggered immunity, which detects conserved pathogen molecules, such as flagellin, Elongation Factor Thermo unstable, peptidoglycan and chitin by host receptors.56 However, very little is known about the effector proteins that contribute to Botryosphaeriaceae virulence. Among the 937 secreted proteins predicted from the L. theobromae genome, we identified 359 putative effectors. Searches for conserved motifs among these effectors showed that 157 contain Y/F/WxC motifs, 45 contain L/IxAR motifs, 1 contains YxSL[R/K] motifs, and 13 contain a single RxLR motif each. Among these, 77 putative effectors were specific to L. theobromae. Five effectors (BR_1.280, BR_2.1361, BR_2.1420, BR_4.711 and BR_10.166) exhibited a strong suppressive effect, whereas BR_1.397, BR_1.899 and BR_5.292 had a weak effect in N. benthamiana (Fig. 5). Two of the effectors, BR_1.280 and BR_2.1361, encode hypothetical proteins (Fig. 5). These results significantly expand our understanding of the determinants of pathogenicity or virulence in Botryosphaeriaceae. Putative effectors and their hypersensitive responses in N. benthamiana.

Potential adaptations of the L. theobromae genome and transcriptome for plant cell wall degradationPhytopathogenic fungi encode many CAZymes. During colonization and infection, CAZymes play an important role in the disassembly of plant cell walls, including the breakdown, biosynthesis or modification of glycoconjugates and oligo- and polysaccharides.3,4 CAZymes are grouped into five classes (glycoside hydrolases, GH; glycosyl transferases, GT; polysaccharide lyases; carbohydrate esterases, CE and auxiliary activities, AA) and an associated module (carbohydrate-binding modules, CBMs).To understand the potential genes involved in the adaptation of L. theobromae to different habitats and substrates, we identified the repertoire of CAZymes known to be involved in organic matter degradation. A total of 820 CAZymes (mapped to 763 predicted L. theobromae genes) (Supplementary Table S18) were identified (see Fig. 2C). From the identified CAZymes, 10 (AA3, AA7, CBM18, CE1, CE10, GH109, GH3 GH43, GH78 and GT1) were expanded in the L. theobromae genome. Among the 283 genes up-regulated during infection, 66 are annotated as cell wall-degrading enzymes (CWDEs), involved in lignin degeneration (6 genes), cellulose degeneration (11 genes), hemicellulose degeneration (8 genes) and pectin degeneration (13 genes) (Fig. 4B). GHs represented the largest super family involved in carbohydrate degradation processes.3,5 For a successful infection, pathogens must encode pectin degrading enzymes to break down plant pectin. The GH28 (polygalacturonases) family plays a critical role in pectin degradation in fungal pathogens such as C. higginsianum, V. mali and V. pyri5,40,57 and has expanded in the genomes of the two Valsa species.3 When compared with the other fungal genomes, the genome of L. theobromae has the most GH28 members (14 genes, of which 4 were up-regulated during infection), suggesting that L. theobromae has a high capacity for pectin degradation.Lignocellulose, which is composed of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin, is one of the barriers that pathogens must surpass in order to colonize host tissues. Since L. theobromae is mainly a trunk pathogen, lignocellulose degrading enzymes likely play a major role during infection.4 Indeed, GH subfamilies involved in the degradation of cellulose and hemicellulose were the most abundant among all the fungal genomes. The degradation of cellulose requires the collaboration of endoglucanases (GH6, GH9, GH12, GH44, GH45, GH51, GH74, GH124, CBM65 and CBM72), cellobiohydrolases (GH6, GH7, GH19, GH48 and GH74) and ß-1,4-glucosidase (GH3). The L. theobromae genome encodes many of these CWDEs. Furthermore, among all the fungal pathogens studied, L. theobromae possesses the highest number of GH3s in its genome. Xylanases in the GH3 sub-family degrade xylan, and the L. theobromae genome contains a complete suite of enzymes to degrade xylan (Supplementary Fig. S5). During infection, three GH12, one GH7 and three GH3 genes encoding lignocellulose-degrading enzymes were up-regulated in L. theobromae, indicating their ability to effectively degrade cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin. Similar up-regulation of these genes were observed in L. theobromae.5 Compared with L. theobromae, the GH12 family is expanded in C. higginsianum, and similar CAZyme modules are available in L. theobromae, A. fumigatus and F. graminearum.3,5,6 Among the fungi analysed so far, the L. theobromae genome encodes the highest number of xyloglucan transglucosylases (GH16, 24 genes), followed by F. graminearum, C. higginsianum and C. graminicola. Endo-ß-1,4-cellulases (GH5) represent another gene family with a high number of encoded genes in L. theobromae, and these genes are commonly found in highly pathogenic species, such as E.lata and N. parvum.3,5,6 Our analyses identified the highest number of GH5s in C. higginsianum, followed by L. theobromae and C. graminicola.CBMs are an important gene family with carbohydrate binding activity.58 According to our comparative analysis, the highest number of CBMs was found in the highly pathogenic P. oryzae (99 genes), followed by C. graminicola (70 genes), C. higginsianum (80 genes), F. graminearum (68 genes) and L. theobromae (54 genes). In contrast, all the non-pathogenic species, including S. pombe (8 genes) and S. cerevisiae (8 genes), have fewer reported CBMs in their genomes.AAs are families of redox enzymes that act in conjunction with CAZymes to degrade lignocellulosic material. They represent ligninolytic enzymes and lytic polysaccharide mono-oxygenases involved in lignin breakdown.5,59 Our analyses found that both AA3 (38 genes) and AA7 (50 genes) families were expanded in the L. theobromae genome. The AA3 family is related to cellobiose dehydrogenase activity, and AA7 oxidizes glycosyl residues.59 These AA3 genes were also abundant in the N. parvum and Stereum hirsutum genomes.3 However, only one or two AA family genes were present in the non-pathogenic fungal genomes.3.11. Lasiodiplodia theobromae gene expression induced by infection and high temperature exhibits characteristics of opportunistic phytopathogensTranscriptome analysis conducted at two temperatures and at two time points after host inoculation identified a large number of differentially expressed genes. Differences in virulence at the different temperatures on grape shoots and growth on axenic cultures are shown in Fig. 3B. According to the transcriptomic data of samples collected from L. theobromae cultures on PDA plates, 361 genes were up-regulated, whereas 248 were down-regulated at the higher temperature. These up-regulated genes include genes with LysM (see Fig. 3D), allergens, GH 61 family genes, cytochrome P450s and heat shock proteins. Of these, few were related to primary pathogenicity mechanisms.Phylogenetic analysis was conducted for randomly selected genes belong to glycosyl hydrolase family (Fig. 6A). According to the analysis, all of the genes clade together with related GH family genes identified from previous studies. Figure 6B demonstrates the gene expression of these genes. To investigate the roles of these up-regulated genes in the virulence of Botryosphaeriaceae, a GH 5 family putative cellulase gene (GH 7.188) and a GH 61 family putative lignocellulase gene (GH 2.1698) were selected for further study. These two genes were overexpressed using a strong PtrpC promoter. The overexpressing transformants showed no effect on vegetative growth and conidiation on PDA medium. We confirmed the elevated expression levels of these over-expressing transformants of GH 2.1698 and GH 7.188. Intriguingly, pathogenicity assays showed that both overexpressing transformants had significantly enhanced virulence on grape shoots compared with the wild-type strain CSS-01 (Fig. 6C and D). These results suggest that lignocellulose degrading enzymes play an important role during the colonization of Botryosphaeriaceae canker development. Furthermore, our results suggest that virulence in this family is temperature dependent, a typical characteristic of opportunistic infection.

DiscussionIn this study, we developed fundamental genomic and transcriptomic resources for functional characterization of three botryosphaeriaceous pathogens, B.dothidea, L.theobromae and N.parvum. These three species have similar genome sizes (42.1 Mb to 43.3 Mb), and the assemblies of B. dothidea and N. parvum were similar to those reported in previous studies. Indeed, all the sequenced genomes in Botryosphaeriaceae have similar sizes, ranging from 36.9 to 43.5 Mb, with similar genome coverage.3,11,14 In addition to these botryosphaeriaceous taxa, the genome sizes for other pathogenic fungi compared here were similar to other common plant pathogens with similar lifestyles (Table 3).32,40,60,61 Both the JELLYFISH analysis,39 which estimated genome size based on k-mer distributions,62 and the tRNA analyses indicated a high degree of completeness in the assembled genomes. Furthermore, transcriptomic data obtained through RNASeq confirmed the accuracy and completeness of the assembled genome and facilitated the refinement of the predicted gene models of L. theobromae.63Comparison of genome sizes between L. theobromae and other pathogenic fungiComparison of genome sizes between L. theobromae and other pathogenic fungiCompared with the protein-coding genes predicted for other pathogens,3,14,40,60,61 our combined approach allowed for the prediction of the highest number of protein-coding genes in any fungal pathogen. Identifying repetitive elements is important for understanding the genome architecture of a pathogen and, ultimately, its evolution.3,4 Repetitive elements present in the genomes of Botryosphaeriaceae taxa were much lower, ranging from 3.02% to 3.84%. This ratio is much lower than those reported for other pathogens such as P. oryzae (11.75%),64,N. crassa (12.72%),60,Ustilago virens (25%)61 and V. mali (14.05%).40 This finding confirms the high genetic similarity observed among Botryosphaeriaceae species in previous studies.65Comparative genome analysis revealed data on genetic variation, differential gene expression, and evolutionary dynamics between species and their specific adaptations to different environmental conditions and lifestyles. This study revealed that Botryosphaeriaceae species are phylogenetically closer to opportunistic pathogens, indicating that they may share traits common to opportunistic fungal pathogens. This was clearly evidenced from the phylogenetic study as well as from Fig. 2B, which shows that Botryosphaeriaceae fungi share the highest number of unique orthologous gene families with opportunistic fungal pathogens (1,049) than to pathogenic (221) and non-pathogenic fungi (36). It was further confirmed by the inventory of genes identified by comparative genome analysis, which are involved in the infection and the colonization of the host by L. theobromae and other Botryosphaeriaceae pathogens. Similar results were discovered in a recent transcriptomic study conducted for L. theobromae.5 Functional annotation of these genomes provides additional evidence for the hypothesis that Botryosphaeriaceae fungi are more closely related to opportunistic fungi. According to the GO categories of the overrepresented genes, Botryosphaeriaceae species shared only three overrepresented genes with primary fungal pathogens (Supplementary Table S11), whereas they shared 27 with opportunistic phytopathogens (Supplementary Table S12). The categories of genes shared with opportunistic pathogens include those related to cell wall degradation, carbohydrate and protein metabolism, gene expression regulation and the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. Many of these genes have been shown to be involved in the pathogenicity of many fungal pathogens.3,5,14,40,61 Based on the phylogenetic analysis, the highest number of unique orthologous gene families shared with other opportunistic fungal pathogens, and the highest number of overrepresented gene categories shared with other opportunistic pathogens, we confirmed that Botryosphaeriaceae fungi are more closely related to opportunistic pathogens than to other pathogens. Gene categories shared between Botryosphaeriaceae species and other pathogenic fungi were also enriched in core elements essential for virulence in many pathogens. Phosphorylation is an essential post-translational modification that regulates a broad spectrum of biological processes through the activity of numerous protein kinases.66 Signal transduction is another important gene category for a pathogen to respond to environmental changes during host infection and regulate a network of cellular pathways.66. All of these virulence-related genetic elements are commonly found in the genomes of fungal pathogens such as P. oryzae, Fusarium oxysporum,66,Botrytis cinera67 and many other pathogenic fungi.68During the comparative genome analysis, we observed significant expansions and contractions in many gene families. Such changes can provide adaptive advantages for the organisms at certain ecological niches during natural selection.69 These expanded gene families include those responsible for virulence and nutrient uptake. In addition to the cellular transporters and cytochrome P450s, several gene families related to secondary metabolism have also undergone significant expansion. Among the 58 secondary metabolite clusters observed, NPRS gene clusters are responsible for the synthesis of toxic polypeptides, whereas PKS clusters are responsible for the production of naphthalenone pentaketides in botryosphaeriaceous fungi, D. seriata, L. theobromae5 and N. parvum, as well as other pathogens such as A. fumigatus, A. nidulans, D. ampelina, E. lata, Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and T.minima.9 Even though secondary metabolite gene clusters are not subjected to regulation during infection, their significant expansion in the genome suggests that they may be involved in producing disease symptoms and host adaptations. Cytochrome P450s are a super family of mono-oxygenases involved in the post-synthesis modification of diverse metabolites.3,9,46,70 Furthermore, these proteins facilitate fungal adaptation to specific ecological niches by modifying potentially harmful environmental chemicals.70 Having a genome enriched in species-specific cytochrome P450s may help explain the broad geographic distribution of botryosphaeriaceous taxa. Expansion of this gene family observed in this study further confirms their high capacity for adapting to different hosts, which may explain the wide host range of Botryosphaeriaceae species. Because these genes are also related to several physiological traits, their expansion has likely facilitated the evolution of pathogenicity.71Cellular transporters have significant roles in fungal pathogenesis as well as in protecting against plant defence compounds.72 Comparative genome analysis revealed that L. theobromae encode the highest number of cellular transporters among all the analysed genomes. Genes encoding (ABC)–type transport systems showed significant expansion in L. theobromae, and their expression is significantly up-regulated during infection. The importance of these multidrug facilitator transporters in drug resistance and pathogenesis has been confirmed in B. cinera, Gibberella pulicaris, P. oryzae, Nectria haematococca and other pathogenic fungi.15 They are also responsible for polysaccharide, lipid and amino acid transport. Similarly, the expanded and up-regulated transporter family genes identified in this study could also play an important role in the fungal pathogenesis of L. theobromae during infection by providing protection through the detoxification of antifungal phytotoxins. Sugar transporters also showed a high level of regulation during host infection in L. theobromae, allowing it to adapt to different host environments with varying pH conditions52 and various plant–pathogen interactions.52,60,73 These sugar symporters belong to the MFS family responsible for sporulation, cell-to-cell communication and pathogenesis in fungi.74 Because these families are up-regulated during infection, both ABC-type transporters and MFS transporters are considered to be virulence or pathogenicity factors in L. theobromae.Transcriptome profiling identified a set of putative effectors that were up-regulated during L. theobromae infection. These include conserved functional domains important for fungal pathogenesis mechanisms and other effector domains such as CFEM. Effectors enable pathogens to evade or suppress plant defence systems.56,75 Genetic manipulation of fungal pathogens for candidate effector genes is difficult and cumbersome. This makes the whole process of effector functional analysis time consuming and laborious. Translocation of effector proteins to host using a type III secretion system (T3SS) of bacterial pathogens proven to be a fast alternative to the traditional method of generating fungal transformants. This efficient effector delivery (pEDV) system utilizes the N-terminal portion of AvrRps4, which is required for Type III secretion system (T3SS)-dependent delivery and in planta processing. In this study, we have experimentally shown that several randomly selected putative effectors can suppress B.glumae triggered hypersensitivity in N.benthamiana. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that these putative effectors play crucial roles in the pathogenesis of L. theobromae on its hosts by identifying PAMPs. This system has been successfully used in screening candidate non-bacterial effectors predicted in the genome Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis,76,P. oryzae,77 and Ustilaginoidea virens.64In addition to the biotrophic stage, most phytopathogens also have hemi-biotrophic or necrotrophic stages, in which the fungi destroy the cell wall, enter the cell, and kill and destroy host cell structures.72 Proteins secreted by these pathogens play crucial roles in early colonization and pathogenesis by targeting all components of the primary and secondary plant cell walls.3 The current study reveals a broad range of gene families with potential virulence functions in L. theobromae, similar to the botryosphaeriaceous taxa D. seriata3, L. theobromae5 and N. parvum3. Previous studies have identified a broad range of key genes responsible for wood degradation and host colonization in phytopathogens.3,5,78,79 Similar to highly pathogenic B. cinera,80,L.theobromae possesses the highest number of genes encoding pectolytic enzymes among the sequenced Botryosphaeriaceae genomes. The significant induction of these genes during infection is consistent with their critical roles in fungal pathogenesis. Because most of the dicotyledon cell walls consist of ~35% pectin, these polygalacturonases facilitate the breakdown of cell wall.81 This localized degradation of cell wall is required for the fungus to access the plant cytoplasm and to spread across host tissues. 81,82 Their importance has been experimentally confirmed in many other species, including Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. higginsianum, C. lindemuthianum, V. mali and V. pyri.3,5,40,57,82 In addition, the L. theobromae genome encodes a wider array of enzymes (GH5, GH3, GH16, GH43) targeting cellulose and hemicellulose, similar to other pathogens such as D. seriata, E. lata, N. parvum and P. chlamydospora.3,5,78,80,82 Their expression levels were significantly induced during infection, and the current study confirmed the enhanced pathogenicity of several putative lignocellulase genes by overexpressing them in L. theobromae. Together, the up-regulation of genes encoding CAZymes targeting pectin, cellulose, hemicellulose and xylan during infection explains the rapid colonization and infection of L. theobromae on woody plants.Carbohydrate binding modules have been linked to the evolution of fungal pathogenicity in many fungi. During the infection of L. theobromae, CBM 18 family genes were significantly up-regulated. This subclass domain of chitin recognition has been confirmed for fungal protection from host defences by preventing plant factors from degrading fungal chitin.83 Hence, during fungal infection, this family together with auxiliary enzymes participates in fungal pathogenesis. In this study, the AA3 and AA7 families showed significant expansion in the L. theobromae genome. AA7-domain families are responsible for oxidizing a variety of carbohydrates and contributing to lignin degradation,59 whereas AA3-domain families participate in the degradation of cellulose, hemicellulose and lignin.45 Similar expansions of AA7s and AA3s have been found in many other fungal pathogens, such as B. cinera, C. graminicola, C. higginsianum, D. seriata, E. lata, F. graminearum, F. solani, P. oryzae, N. parvum and S. hirsutum.3,59,84 In addition, this study showed the significantly induced expression of peroxidases and oxidoreductases in L. theobromae during infection. These two classes of enzymes are known to be involved in pathogenicity-related processes such as the degradation of lignin and the detoxification of reactive oxygen species produced by the host.3,5,78Our pathogenicity analysis revealed that a higher temperature increased the virulence of L. theobromae on grapevine. Consistent with this result, transcriptome analysis also revealed that several genes were up-regulated at a higher temperature. Furthermore, overexpression of two genes belonging to GH 5 and GH 61 families in L. theobromae significantly enhanced its virulence on Vitis shoots. The GH 5 and GH 61 families encode cellulases and lignocellulases, respectively. These genes are involved in cell wall degradation during infection and colonization. Transcriptome analysis revealed several genes corresponding to fungal pathogenicity, such as chitin-binding CBM family genes, cytochrome P450s and heat shock proteins, which were induced at high temperature. This increased virulence at a higher temperature is a typical characteristic of an opportunistic infection.4 Hence, we can confirm that L. theobromae can cause opportunistic infections at high temperatures. Transcriptomic study conducted on L. theobromae also confirmed the up-regulation of virulence related genes under heat stress conditions.5 Recently few studies have been conducted to determine the influence of environmental conditions such as high temperature and high humidity, on the establishment of the pathogen and the development of numerous diseases on plants.5,85In summary, this study revealed a high similarity between L. theobromae and other opportunistic fungal phytopathogens. We established genomic and transcriptomic resources for L. theobromae and incorporated the data into a comparative analysis to catalogue genes and gene families with putative virulence functions. L.theobromae employs multiple virulence strategies to adapt to its diverse lifestyles, including CWDEs, secreted proteases, secondary metabolites, putative effectors and membrane transporters. Specific gene families of pectinases, secondary metabolism enzymes and transporters related to multidrug resistance are uniquely expanded in the L. theobromae genome and are frequently up-regulated during infection. In addition, large gene inventories were involved in cell wall degradation, nutrient uptake and secondary metabolism in L. theobromae. These results suggest potential adaptations for colonization and infection of the host and reflect their hemi-biotrophic lifestyle. Functional studies, together with transcriptomic data, indicate the active role of putative effectors and some lignocellulases in virulence, pathogenicity and host adaptation. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that several pathogenicity-related genes were induced at high temperature. This discovery, together with the phylogenomic analysis, indicates that L.theobromae is an opportunistic phytopathogen. This study provides valuable genomic and transcriptomic resources for future studies of the evolution and pathogenesis of L. theobromae.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.The work is supported by CARS-30, NSFC (31501567), KJCX20140402 and Beijing Nova Program (Z141105001814047).

IntroductionThe regulation of gene expression is a fundamental mechanism driving biological processes. Transcriptional regulation rules the access of polymerase complex to the gene, activating or repressing the transcription process. Transcription Factors (TF) play a central role in this context; they are proteins able to bind specific DNA regions recognizing a short sequence of nucleotides called Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBS). There is a vast literature concerning TFs, starting from seminal and general papers1,2 to the most specific ranging from the study of the mechanism that allows TFs to efficiently and rapidly find the target along the DNA helix,3,4 to the study of the roles that specific TFs play in given biological tasks and how they influence the regulation of the transcription of their target genes.5 TFBS occurrences along a DNA sequence can be statistically determined via a Position-specific Weight Matrix (PWM), that is essentially a matrix reporting the frequency of nucleotides for each position of the experimentally found binding sites. Several databases based on experimental evidences were designed collecting information about TFs and the corresponding TFBSs, TRANSFAC6,7 and JASPAR8 are often used as a reference for Eukariotes. In the review9 different algorithmic approaches to predict TFBSs, starting from PWMs, are presented and compared. Despite the large number of genes in higher animals (~30,000 genes) the number of known TFs is one order of magnitude smaller, indicating a necessary interplay between different TFs in order to regulate the activity of all genes. TFBSs are often clustered in peculiar families and patterns made of several TFBSs can be found in the promoter region, i.e. thousands bases upstream the Transcription Starting Site (TSS), or also very far from the TSS in the Cis-regulatory modules (CRM). The interested reader can find in Ref. 10 (see also references therein) a comprehensive review of the update knowledge about CRM. In this work, we will focus on the synergism of different TFs in the promoter region, trying to identify those TFs couples able to co-operate, and to discover the context in which those couples are involved in. The synergism between TFs in human DNA has been investigated by several studies focused on the analysis of mutual positioning of TFBSs along the DNA regions. Some studies, taking into consideration cross-species sequence comparison trying to identify possible regulatory modules in human DNA.11–13 Other works focus on a specific class of TFs14 or on a single TF15 trying to identify the regulatory modules to which the considered TF belongs to. Finally in Ref. 16, the whole human genome has been investigated in order to reveal the couples of TFs that synergically act in the transcription regulation. In the present work, we developed a new computational method able to predict the possible interaction between couples of TFs analysing the statistical properties of the distribution of couples of TFBSs in the promoter region of human DNA, and comparing them with a random distribution of TFBSs. We obtained a list of highly related TFs couples, whose TFBSs occurrences significantly group together for a given set of promoter genes, identifying the biological context in which the couples are involved in and the process they should contribute to regulate. 2. Materials and methods2.1. Extracting TFBSs of human genesThe list of all human genes was extracted from the Genome Browser (UCSC)17 and all the associated 104,178 transcript sequences (genome version hg38) were retrieved by a proper R library18 querying the UCSC data repository. For each transcript a promoter region, made of a sequence of 2,000 bp upstream the TSS, was extracted. In order to remove redundant information, the set of all promoter sequences was processed filtering out redundant overlapped transcripts, reducing their number (and the related promoter sequences) to 36,830. In this study, we used a set of 194 most studied and experimentally validated Human Transcription Factors according to MAPPER.19 We associated to each TF the corresponding Position-specific Weight Matrix (PWM), i.e. the matrix reporting the frequency of nucleotides for each position of the experimentally validated binding sites. It is worth noting that a TF can be associated to different PWMs and, on the other hand, a PWM can be associated to more than one TF. A total number of 192 PWMs was considered in this work and each of them was associated in a biunivocal relation to one TF with only a few exceptions. For the sake of simplicity and readability, we refer to PWM models as TFs and vice versa. The PWMs matrices were retrieved from an open access repository available at the following address http://cistrome.org/~jian/motif_collection/databases/Transfac/pwm/ (12 October 2017, date last accessed). We applied the matchPWM() function, a sequence-based transcription factor binding site search algorithm, integrated into the Biostrings R library,20 to extract and collect the positions list of all binding sites for both all considered transcripts and PWMs. For our purposes, we have considered an acceptance threshold probability of 0.9. The described procedure is clearly summarized in the workflow in Fig. 1. Workflow for the extraction of human TFBSs.Workflow for the extraction of human TFBSs.2.2. Transcription factor co-localization and deviation from randomnessThe above z-score function, measuring how many standard deviations the actual number of couples is far from the expected number of couples in the case of a random distribution, provides a reasonable value of the association between TFBSi and TFBSj. Significantly, high values of zTFi,TFj suggest that the two considered TFs are associated, i.e. their TFBSs have a probability to occur as neighbours higher than the one expected for a random distribution. On the contrary when zTFi,TFj is negative, with a high absolute value, elements in the two TFBSs occur as neighbours less frequently than expected in a random distribution, so that in this case the TFs are disassociated. In the following, in order to identify the synergy between transcription factors, we will focus on the case of high positive values of zTFi,TFj<U+2060>.2.3. Computing similarity score of PWMsThe prediction algorithm of TFBSs is based on the PWMs obtained by experimental analysis. Since we are interested in identifying couples of TFs whose TFBSs occur together in a window of a given size, we have to be sure that the two corresponding models are enough different since if two models are very similar they are likely to share binding sites or a significant portion of them. We used two different approaches to evaluate models similarity. The former is a direct approach aiming to provide a similarity pairwise score of two models based on the comparison of nucleotide frequencies of the PWMs. The latter approach can be defined as ‘a posteriori’, since we evaluate the closeness of models by computing the number of overlapped binding sites with respect to the total number of couples whose distance is closer than l<U+2060>. Using a linear combination of the above described similarity scores we determine if two models are ‘structurally’ far from each other and we can significantly evaluate the association between two truly different models according to the algorithm described in the previous section.2.4.

The plane is divided into two regions: the upper-left sector, where Overlapping Score is higher than Similarity Score, provides selected couples. Lower-right sector, where Overlapping Score is lower than Similarity Score, provides Discarded couples.2.6. Protein-protein interaction network analysisIn order to validate the synergy of TFs couples identified by the algorithm here presented we analysed Protein-Protein Interaction network (PPI) to test the interaction of this couples in the network by using shortest path.Protein-Protein Interaction network was downloaded from STRING database.22 We considered all the possible interaction sources between proteins giving a score threshold of 0.7 (high confidence interaction). The obtained network is made of 719,288 edges (interactions) and 14,932 nodes (proteins). The iGraph R package (https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/igraph/index.html (12 October 2017, date last accessed)) was used to compute the shortest path from the adjacency matrix of the graph.3. Results and discussion3.1. Selecting significant TF couplesIn the previous Section, Equation (6) has been derived in order to provide a measure of association between each couple of transcription factors (TFi, TFj) with respect to a given transcript TRk. Our goal is to find out couples of TFs that are significantly related in gene-regulation mechanism. As previously mentioned, the higher the value of z(TFi,TFj;TRk)<U+2060>, the higher the association between TFi and TFj in the transcript promoter TRk sequence will be. Since for each transcript, we have to test a considerably large number of couples (TFi, TFj) and we test the association between couples in a large number of transcripts, we select only those couples for which the value of z(TFi,TFj;TRk) is higher than 5 (meaning that the number of occurrence of couples TFi TFj in a radius l is far from that expected by chance more than 5 S.D.) and we indicate with NZ5(TFi,TFj) the number of transcripts TRk for which the couple (TFi, TFj) has a z-score greater than 5. Given a couple (TFi, TFj) it is reasonable to expect that a large value of NZ5(TFi,TFj) indicates that the two models TFi, TFj are functionally associated. However, a high value of NZ5(TFi,TFj) could refer to a couple of models with a high similarity score rather than a functional association between TFi and TFj. Therefore, to correctly identify relevant associated transcription factors, we will use the overlapping score OVD(TFi, TFj) and the similarity score JSD(TFi, TFj). In Fig. 3, OVD(TFi, TFj) and JSD(TFi, TFj) values are shown for all the TF couples which have NZ5TFi,TFj>20<U+2060>. Since the higher the value of JSD the lower the similarity between two models is, while the higher the values of OVD the higher the similarity between binding sites is, as selection criterion to identify significant couples we used the inequality JSD > OVD. In such a way, the plane (OVD, JSD) is divided into two regions: the upper-left sector, where models are not similar and the overlapping is low (selected couples), while in the lower-right sector, where models are similar and the overlapping is high (discarded couples). It is worth remarking that even if measures JSD and OVD could appear redundant, Fig. 3 clearly stated that the two measures are quite different: there are couples with similar JSD and very different OVD and vice versa. In fact JSD measure only depends on the related PWM while OVD measure depends on the considered dataset, e.g. two models can bind the same sequence even if they are different. Considering a combination of both measures we obtain a more robust selection criterion.In Fig. 4 (panel A) is sketched the procedure we use to select the 547 couples identifying pairs of transcription factors that are likely to synergistically regulate gene transcription. In the following sections, we will analyse the set of selected couples in order to associate to them a biological task and to find the most relevant associated couples according to their statistical features (see Fig. 4 panel B). Workflow for the analysis of TF couples. In panel A, the procedure for the selection of relevant couples is depicted. In panel B, the analysis of significant couples is described both in terms of enrichment tests and sorting of best couples.Workflow for the analysis of TF couples. In panel A, the procedure for the selection of relevant couples is depicted. In panel B, the analysis of significant couples is described both in terms of enrichment tests and sorting of best couples.3.2. Enrichment analysis and validationIn order to evaluate the biological significance of the obtained TF couples, we performed hypergeometric enrichment tests.23 Given a couple of models, we want to test whether the set of genes potentially regulated by the synergy of the corresponding two TFs, is enriched in a particular category-term. We wondered whether those genes are linked in a given biological task in order to associate the TF couple to a given biological process. We selected a list of categories and related terms, reported in Table 1, that identify different biological tasks and contexts. We then performed for each identified TF couple hypergeometric enrichment tests related to all the considered terms. Categories and terms for the enrichment analysisCategories and terms for the enrichment analysisFor each TF couple we obtained a list of P-values linked to the corresponding terms. The enrichment results were then compared with those of ten random sets of genes. Each set was generated preserving the same number of sample couples (i.e. 547) and the same number of genes for each couple. The results are reported in Fig. 5 where solid plot represents the enrichment of couples identified by our algorithm and dashed plots show enrichment of random sets. Each point of the plots shows in log-scale the number of TF couples (y-axis) with at least one term whose P-value falls in the corresponding P-value interval (x-axis). For example in the black plot, there is only one couple (M00106—M00967) having a term [ubiquitinyl hydrolase activity (GO: 0036459)] enriched with a P-value smaller than 10-18 (3.63E–19), another couple (M00739—M00799) for P-value smaller than 10-14 and three different couples for P-value smaller than 10-13 and so on (see Table 2 where all the enriched terms are ordered according to their P-values). It is worth noting that some couples have more than one term with a significant P-value, for example couple (M00106—M00967) shows several terms with a remarkable enrichment: GO Molecular function—ubiquitinyl hydrolase activity (GO: 0036459)—P-value 3.63E–19, Go Molecular function—cysteine-type peptidase activity (GO: 0008234)—P-value 4.56E–17, Go Biological Process—Ubiquitin-dependent protein catabolic process (GO: 0006511), and so on. The comparison of enrichment P-values, related to couples identified by our algorithm (black plot), with those related to random sets (ten coloured plots) clearly highlights the significance and consistency of our analysis, since none of the random sets shows P-values smaller than 10-7. Also analysing the plots for larger P-values intervals the number of enriched couples is significantly higher than all the corresponding numbers of random sets (taking into account the log-scale units in y-axis). The PWM model IDs and the corresponding TF names are reported in columns 1–4 for each couple; the category and the related term the couple resulted enriched in are reported in columns 5–6; column 7 reports the related P-value of the hypergeometric testThe PWM model IDs and the corresponding TF names are reported in columns 1–4 for each couple; the category and the related term the couple resulted enriched in are reported in columns 5–6; column 7 reports the related P-value of the hypergeometric testNumber of couples enriched in at least one term as a function of their smallest P-value.

Solid plot shows the enrichment of the couples identified by our algorithm, dashed plots show the enrichment of random couples for comparison.3.3. Analysis of relevant transcription factor couplesIn this section, we analyse the most significant couples identified by our algorithm. Among the 547 selected couples, we consider as particularly relevant those couples with the smallest enrichment P-value or with the best associated parameters (highest number of transcripts, smallest OVD and highest JSD) as reported in Fig. 4 panel B. The list of couples with the smallest P-values (smaller than 10-7) is reported in Table 2. The analysis of the couples reported in the table suggests several observations, providing and/or confirming evidence of the synergism of several TF couples and the related biological contexts they are involved in. The smallest P-values are reported for the couple CDP (also known as Cutl1) (M00106)–HNF4 (M00967), as already mentioned above. The related enriched terms are mainly associated (4 out of 6) with catabolic processes while the other two terms are ubiquitinyl hydrolase activity and cysteine-type peptidase activity. Concerning the couple Myc (M00799)–E2F (M00803) (and its cluster E2F–1 and E2F–4) it can be observed that it appears several times in the table associated to different terms. These terms can be grouped into main activities/contexts regarding: (1) gonadal mesoderm development and mesenchyme development, (2) Nucleosome assembly and organization, Protein-DNA complex assembly and Protein-DNA Complex Subunit Organization and (3) Protein Autophosphorylation. It is worth noting that in literature there are many references associated to the couple Myc–E2F. In Ref. 24, it has been shown how the two TFs are linked via mSin3A, a core component of a large multiprotein co-repressor complex with associated histone deacetylase (HDAC) enzymatic activity. As reported in Ref. 25, it has been identified a subunit of the complex NuA4 as the product of TRA1, an ATM-related gene homologous to human TRRAP, an essential cofactor for c-Myc- and E2F-mediated oncogenic transformation. A further link between Myc and E2F was studied in Ref. 26 highlighting their relationships with chromatin structure and stability. It is remarkable and can be source of further investigations the association of the couple AREB (M00415)–TFII-I (M00706) (also known as GTF2I) with KEGG pathway Valine leucine and isoleucine biosynthesis (the couple showing a P-value of 4.10E–8). Interestingly, transcription factors of STAT family (STAT—M00777, STATx—M00223 and STAT5A–M00457) strongly interact with TBP (M00980) in the promoters of genes belonging to the region of chr5q13, that is known to be associated with various neurological disorders and pathologies such as Spinal Muscular Atrophy, Hairy Cell Leukemia and it is also connected to Alcohol Dependence.27–29 Finally, it could deserve attention the couple Areb6 (M00414)–E2F (M00803) associated to the term Mental retardation, even if not reported in Table 2, it shows a remarkable P-value (6·10-6). Areb6 belongs to the Zeb transcription factor family that has been shown to be involved in mental retardation syndromes.30 In Table 3, the best couples, in terms of association, are reported ordered by the number of significant Transcripts. We selected those couples with a number of significant transcripts (Z-score higher than 5) higher than 100, with an Overlapping score (OVD) smaller than 0.2 and a Similarity score (JSD) higher than 0.2 (it is also reported in the fifth column the average Z-Score). The couple MZF1 (M00083)—MAZ (M00649) shows a Z-score higher than 5 in 1,014 transcript promoter sequences (with an average z-score of 7.77—more than 7 S.D. far from the expected average value). Myc-associated zinc finger protein (MAZ) and Myeloid zinc finger 1 (MZF1) are both transcription factors characterized by a zinc finger small protein structural motif. The associated PWMs show a similar common sub-motif characterized by a GGGA sequence. Nevertheless the PWMs have different length (6 and 8) and the correspondent similarity score, JSD, results to be 0.21 meaning that the two PWMs are similar but globally not so close to each other. Significantly, the OVD overlapping score is quite low 0.188 meaning that, on average, among all the identified TFBSs couple (both in a window of 80 bp) of the two TFs, less than 1 out of 5 couples are overlapped. This is why we included this couple in the selected set of TFs couples. The surprisingly high number of transcripts for which the two TFs co-occur should deserve deeper investigations. The couple MZF1 (M00083)–E2F (M00803) shows 456 transcripts with a Z-score higher than 5 (with an average z-score of 6, 77, OVD = 0.09 and JSD = 0.21). Interestingly they are involved in several diseases, in particular, as reported in Ref. 31, they are both potential key regulators of PKD1 and PKD2 whose mutations are linked with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD). We found one transcript of PKD1 uc002cos.1 with a Z-score for the couple equal to 2 and two transcripts of PKD2 uc003hre.3 and uc011cdg.2 with Z-score equal to 5.80 and 3.42, respectively. It is interesting that a minor groove binding protein SRY (M00148) is associated to both the models of TBP (M00471 and M00980) with a number of significant transcripts equal to 239 and 203, respectively, a very small OVD close to 0 for both and JSD 0.21 and 0.23, respectively. It is worth noting that the couple Myc (M00799)–E2F (M00803) (also included in Table 2) shows a number of significant transcripts equal to 293, meaning that, besides a clear association with given biological contexts, as discussed in the previous section, there is a strong synergism between the two TFs confirmed by the values reported in the table. Concerning the couple Maz (M00649)–Pu.1 (M00658) (number of significant transcripts equal to 187) it has been shown that three transcription factors Maz, PU.1 and ARNT show significant recognition elements among similarly up or down-regulated genes involved in hematopoietic differentiation or leukemogenesis.32 We note that also the couple Maz (M00649)–ARNT (M00976) is included in the table with a number of significant transcripts equal to 106. The PWM model IDs and the corresponding TF names are reported in columns 1–4 for each couple; Column 5 reports the number of transcripts whose Z-scores, related to the couple, are higher than 5; the average Z-score of all the significant (Z > 5) transcripts is reported in column 6; Overlapping and Similarity Scores are reported in columns 7 and 8, respectivelyThe couple Myc, E2F is reported in bold to highlight it is also included in Table 2.The PWM model IDs and the corresponding TF names are reported in columns 1–4 for each couple; Column 5 reports the number of transcripts whose Z-scores, related to the couple, are higher than 5; the average Z-score of all the significant (Z > 5) transcripts is reported in column 6; Overlapping and Similarity Scores are reported in columns 7 and 8, respectivelyThe couple Myc, E2F is reported in bold to highlight it is also included in Table 2.Frequencies of couples as a function of the shortest path (SP) distance for three classes of protein couples: (i) the selected 547 TF couples (namely BEST, first row), (ii) all the couples of TFs (namely ALL, second row) and iii) 10 random sample sets made of 547 randomly picked protein couples from the whole PPI (namely RANDOM, mean and standard deviation in the third and fourth row, respectively)Frequencies of couples as a function of the shortest path (SP) distance for three classes of protein couples: (i) the selected 547 TF couples (namely BEST, first row), (ii) all the couples of TFs (namely ALL, second row) and iii) 10 random sample sets made of 547 randomly picked protein couples from the whole PPI (namely RANDOM, mean and standard deviation in the third and fourth row, respectively)In order to further validate and provide significance to obtained results, we computed the shortest paths between couples of TFs related to the Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) network downloaded from String database.22 We found a significant overall difference between shortest path distribution of the set of couples selected by our method and the set of all TFs couples. In Table 4, we report the percentages of couples as a function of the Shortest Path (SP) distances for three classes of protein couples: (i) the selected 547 TF couples (namely BEST, first row), (ii) all the couples of TFs (namely ALL, second row) and (iii) 10 random sample sets made of 547 randomly picked protein couples from the whole PPI (namely RANDOM, mean and standard deviation in the third and fourth row, respectively). The majority of couples (around 50%) related to TFs shows a SP equal to 2 both for couples obtained by our algorithm and for all TF couples, while only around 6% of protein random couples has a SP distance equal to 2. The most relevant result is in the difference of the frequency for SP = 1 (indicating a direct interaction) that is ~0.12 for our best couples and ~0.057 for all TF couples (i.e. the ratio is greater than 2), and also for SP = 3 (~0.28 our best couples versus ~0.37 for all TF couples). The distribution for the random protein data shows, not surprisingly, a complete different pattern (the most part of couples having SP equal to 3 and 4). Even considering the limitations of this kind of analysis—a PPI is a global representation of potential interactions between proteins (and consequently TFs) that not always (referring to time and space) is an actual interaction and, moreover, the results depend on the threshold chosen to select significant interactions—it reveals that TFs couples selected by our method show an overall stronger relationship than those in the set of all TFs couples. In particular, we chose a quite strict threshold of 0.7 (as reported in the Material and methods section), so the significance of results has to be found in the ratio between the number of our selected couples and all TFs couples at SP 1 (ratio equal to 2) rather than in the percentages (12% and 6%, approximately) that could significantly change since they depend on the threshold. 4. ConclusionsA better understanding of the mechanisms driving the regulation of protein expression is an essential requisite to shed light on the behaviour of cells. Transcription factors play a central role in this extremely complex task and it has been shown that they synergically co-operate in order to provide a fine tuning of protein expressions. Among the different methods able to detect and identify TFs interplay, a very important resource is the computational methods to which our work mainly refers. In this work, we present a mathematically well-founded procedure able to identify TFs couples that act together, inferring for several of those couples the biological context they are involved in. We introduced a new and robust statistical method based on the use of a good Bernoulli approximation and on a z-score measures able to discriminate between random and non-random co-occurrences of couple of TFs. We extended previous methods based on randomize sequences as in Refs. 15 and 16. In order to avoid biases due to the structural similarity of different models Overlapping and Similarity scores were designed to select TF couples that are significant for the analysis. We used such a method to find pairs of associated transcription factors in the set of all human promoter sequences (selected with a careful analysis from all human transcripts) and we also performed enrichment analysis on the set of genes regulated by identified couples. This analysis provides consistence to our results but also provides a biological context to be associated to the couples. Moreover, we also performed network analysis showing that TFs couples identified by the algorithm here presented are closer than expected in the protein-protein interaction network in terms of shortest path.To our knowledge this is the only work concerning synergy of Transcription Factors taking into account all those features. Some of the couples emerging in this study are already known to be linked in several biological contexts (such as Myc–E2F,24–26 while in other cases our results can lead to hypothesize links between TFs couples and diseases (as for the STAT family that strongly interact with TBM in the promoters of genes belonging to the region of chr5q13 involved in several diseases.27–29 Finally, some other couples were not previously identified (such as the couple MZF1–MAZ) that would deserves further investigation.According to our algorithm two TFs could be associated in different ways, for example they could be co-operative in a strict sense or concurrent in the sense that the presence of one of the two impedes the presence of the other. A small size window, as the one we use, leads us to hypothesize that two transcription factor proteins that could bind sites within the window, either are sufficiently close to each other to physically interact, or only one of the two is able to bind its TFBS because of the steric hindrance.This work represents a step in the direction of designing complex gene regulatory networks, and it provides information on TFs association that could be useful in this context. The identification of significant TFs couples could be of help in the view of artificially altering the regulation of genes by inhibiting the interaction between given TFs couples.Conflict of interestNone declared."
