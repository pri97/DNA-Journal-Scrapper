IntroductionWhile genetic information is just one of many tools that may be used to conserve endangered species, the use of such information is often valuable to facilitate recovery efforts and the management of surviving populations.1 Genetic data from endangered species have been used for multiple conservation applications, e.g. to carry out parentage analysis in ex situ breeding and translocation programmes,2,3 and to quantify levels of genetic diversity and identify factors such as founder effects, genetic drift, genetic bottlenecks, and inbreeding that may threaten endangered species.4–6 However, because of the difficulty of isolating genetic markers and the considerable cost and time associated with extensive genotyping of individuals in populations, many conservation-genetic studies have employed relatively small numbers of genetic loci, such as RFLPs, AFLPs, and SSRs (simple sequence repeats, or microsatellites). Increasing the number of sampled loci may increase the precision and accuracy of estimates of genetic structure and population genetic parameters such as levels of genetic diversity and inbreeding coefficients.7 Furthermore, large numbers of genetic loci are necessary to unequivocally assign parentage, which may be very useful for establishing genetically diverse populations of endangered species through the augmentation of existing genetically depauperate populations or the creation of new populations.Recently, however, the number of genomic-scale sequence collections has increased, enabling rapid gene and marker discovery for an increased number of taxa.8 Previously, the development of such genomic resources was largely limited to model organisms; however, recent advances in DNA sequencing technology have reduced the cost and time required for the development of genomic resources, resulting in a rapid growth in the availability of such data, particularly in non-model organisms.9–11 Transcriptome sequencing, which is DNA sequencing of the mRNA pool of a given tissue, has allowed sequencing efforts to focus on the protein-coding portion of the genome, and has become a valuable approach for developing genomic-level resources of the transcribed portion of the genome.8 Next-generation sequencing technologies, such as 454 pyrosequencing, remove many time-consuming steps involved in Sanger sequencing and now facilitate transcriptome sequencing at a minute fraction of the previously required time and cost.10–15 A single-plate run on the 454 GS-FLX titanium pyrosequencing platform typically produces around a million reads averaging 400 bp in length, often resulting in near complete transcriptome coverage.11,16,17 The generation of such large-scale sequence data is enabling gene discovery, molecular marker development, and comparative analyses in ecologically important, non-model plant taxa,11,18–22 including those of conservation concern.23One species for which conservation efforts would be greatly assisted by the establishment of a genome-level resource is Ziziphus celata (Rhamnaceae), a federally endangered, diploid shrub endemic to central Florida, which is currently known from only 14 populations along the Lake Wales Ridge in Polk and Highlands Counties. The species is highly clonal and previous genetic analyses using allozymes,24 RAPDs,25 AFLPs, and SSRs26 found that 9 of the 14 extant wild populations are uniclonal (i.e. each population comprises a single genetic individual). Depending on the method of determining the number of genotypes, the remaining five populations comprise between 22 and 32 genotypes;26 however, unambiguous quantification of the number of genotypes in these populations will require the employment of a larger number of genetic markers. Very little genetic data are presently available for Z. celata, complicating the development of genetic markers, e.g. as of April 2011, only six DNA sequences had been deposited at NCBI for Z. celata, and none of these represented expressed genes. Furthermore, the entire Rhamnaceae family, which contains ~900 species,27 was represented by fewer than 2000 sequences at NCBI. The development of a genome-level resource for Z. celata stands to improve conservation-genetic approaches in Z. celata and to provide a future basis for comparative genomic studies in the Rhamnaceae, which contains economically important crop and ornamental tree and shrub species.Given the small numbers of populations and genotypes of Z. celata, its recovery relies on the augmentation of uniclonal populations and the introduction of multiple genotypes to publicly protected sites containing appropriate habitat;28,29 however, the ability to establish self-sustaining, sexually reproducing, translocated populations has been complicated by the reproductive failure of most experimental crosses. Such reproductive failure has been attributed to self-incompatibility in Z. celata. Self-incompatibility has been documented or proposed in at least five genera in the Rhamnaceae, including Colletia,30Discaria,31,32Frangula,33Trevoa,34 and Ziziphus.25,35,36Gametophytic self-incompatibility (GSI) has been proposed as the system of self-incompatibility in Z. celata based on results from hundreds of experimental hand pollinations, analysis of RAPD data, and studies of pollen tube inhibition.25,35,37 GSI is a system whereby pollen is rejected when its S-haplotype is the same as either of the S-haplotypes present in the pistil.38,39 In four of the five plant families with well-characterized GSI systems, GSI is mediated by the S-RNase gene.38,39 Previous research suggests that a S-RNase-based system of GSI likely evolved only once in Angiosperms,38,39 and the presence of S-RNase-based GSI in the Rosaceae, a plant family which is closely related to the Rhamnaceae, suggests that this is the most likely mechanism causing GSI in Rhamnaceae.An understanding of the genetic basis of self-incompatibility and the ability to assess mating types in Z. celata would greatly facilitate recovery efforts. Previous research has shown that as few as two mating types may be present in Z. celata wild populations,25,35 the minimum necessary to maintain sexual reproduction in a GSI species; however, more mating types may exist, as the compatibility of most genotypes has not yet been tested. The most efficient approach to determine cross-compatibility is to directly sequence the genes that encode the GSI reaction. Another efficient approach is parentage analysis of progeny to provide indirect evidence of compatible mating types; however, more genetic data and molecular markers are required to carry out either of these approaches in Z. celata.In this study, we conducted 454 pyrosequencing of a normalized cDNA library isolated from flowers of three genotypes of Z. celata. Our goals were to (i) characterize the floral transcriptome of Z. celata, (ii) identify and characterize a large number of gene-based markers, including single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and SSRs, for future genetic analyses, and (iii) determine whether analysis of the floral transciptome includes genes belonging to gene family that encodes the GSI reaction. The increased genomic information produced in this study will aid in creating self-sustaining, sexually reproducing populations of this endangered species and bolster comparative genomic studies in a plant family for which very little genetic data are currently available.2. Materials and methods2.1. Tissue sampling, cDNA library creation, and 454 sequencingDuring January–February 2010, we collected several hundred newly opened flowers from each of three Z. celata genets, including the two S-locus mating types confirmed in the wild and one genet of unknown mating type. We collected flowers in sterile RNase-free tubes, which were placed immediately into liquid nitrogen. Flowers from each of the three mating genotypes were then shipped on dry ice to GATC Inc., in Konstanz, Germany. Flowers from the three genotypes were pooled in equal amounts before RNA extraction. RNA extraction, cDNA synthesis, cDNA library normalization, and 454 sequencing were performed by GATC staff following previously outlined methods.17 The Z. celata floral cDNA library was sequenced in a half-plate run on a 454 GS XLR70 Titanium genomic sequencer (Roche, Inc.).2.2. Assembly and annotationWe trimmed 454 primer sequences from all reads prior to assembly and removed reads with average quality scores lower than 18. We used Seqman Ngen v2.0 (DNAstar, Inc.) to assemble reads into contigs, as this program has been successful in assembling 454 sequences from transcriptomes.13,17 Because no reference genome exists for Ziziphus, reads were assembled de novo. The assembly was run with a minimum match size of 19 nucleotides, match percentage of 95%, mismatch penalty of 18, and gap penalty of 30 (further information on assembly is available from the authors by request). The resulting contig consensus sequences and remaining singletons were then combined into a single set for the following analyses, except where noted.We annotated the 454 sequences by using local BLASTx40 to align the consensus sequences from the assembled contigs and the singleton sequences to the Uniref50 15.441 and the TAIR9 Arabidopsis thaliana42 annotated protein databases using an E-value threshold of 10-11. BLAST results were passed through a custom Perl pipeline that produced tab-delimited tables containing accession numbers, gene name, taxonomic ID, query length, orthologue sequence length, sequence alignment, E-value, and bit score for each protein matching to the Z. celata 454 sequences. To determine the number of unique genes represented, we filtered these files for redundancy in protein accessions. To assess the taxonomic distribution of BLAST hits, we used a custom perl script that employs a BioPerl package to retrieve hierarchical taxonomic identities for each protein accession ID. Assignment of gene ontology (GO) terms to sequences with BLAST matches to known proteins was then performed by importing the accession numbers for the BLAST hits to unique proteins into Blast2go (version 2.3.6; www.blast2go.org). We based these analyses on the contig consensus sequences with positive BLAST matches to 13 401 unique accessions in the TAIR annotated protein database.2.3. Search for the S-locusIn most other taxa, the female component of GSI is encoded by an S-RNase, a member of the T2 RNase family.38,39 Thus, as a first step towards characterizing the genes involved in GSI in Z. celata, we searched annotation results and carried out BLAST searches to find Z. celata 454 sequences belonging to the T2 RNase gene family. We searched the Z. celata annotation results for the terms ‘T2 RNase’, ‘RNase’, ‘ribonuclease T2’, and ‘S-RNase’. We also created a blastable database of characterized S-RNase sequences deposited at NCBI's dbEST, including Nicotiana alata S2, Antirrhinum hispanicum S2, Prunus avium S1, and Pyrus pyrifolia S4.38 We used BLASTx to align all Z. celata contig consensus sequences and singletons to these sequences with an E-value threshold of 10-10. Once we identified sequences that putatively belonged to the T2 RNase gene family, we translated them to proteins, manually aligned them with amino acid sequences from verified members of the T2 RNase gene family38 using Se-Al,43 and inspected their protein-coding motifs for homology with verified members of the gene family.2.4. Molecular marker characterizationWe used custom perl scripts to locate di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide SSRs in the 454 sequences with a minimum length of 12 bp and six contiguous repeating units for di-nucleotide motifs, four contiguous repeats for tri-nucleotide motifs, and three repeating units for tetra-nucleotide motifs. We determined which SSRs occurred in coding regions of genes by extracting the aligned portions of contig consensus sequences that had BLAST matches to annotated protein-coding orthologues in Uniref50, and then used the same algorithm as above to detect SSRs in both the aligned and remaining portions of these contigs. To construct polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers in the flanking regions of SSRs, we used the program BatchPrimer3.44 We created primers with a minimum GC content of 30%, a GC clamp (the last two nucleotides were G or C), a melting temperature between 52 and 55, and we positioned primers to obtain PCR products between 100 and 450 bp.We isolated SNPs in contigs with high coverage depths using the SNP reporter feature in Seqman Pro (DNAstar, Inc.). We identified SNPs with coverage depth of at least 10 and with an alternate allele in a minimum of 20% in all contigs containing >25 reads, in order to obtain an estimate of the transcriptome-wide occurrence of high-quality SNPs. We then enumerated SNPs at sites where coverage depth was at least 8 and where alternate alleles were present at a minimum frequency of 20%.3. Results3.1. Assembly and annotationA half-plate run on the 454 GS-FLX Titanium platform produced 655 337 sequences that, after adaptor and vector trimming, averaged 254 bases in length (Supplementary Fig. S1). Files containing the 454 DNA sequences and quality scores have been deposited at NCBIs Short Read Archive (accession SRA045662). A total of 474 025 reads (72% of total) were assembled into 84 645 contigs, with 181 312 reads remaining as singletons. The average contig length was 408 bases (min = 19, max = 2438), with an average of 5.6 (min = 2, max = 1337) reads assembled per contig (Supplementary Fig. S2) and a GC content of 0.39. The average read length of the singleton sequences was 255 bp, similar to the average length of the reads assembled into contigs (253 bp), and these sequences had an average GC content of 0.37. The mean coverage depth per nucleotide position in the assembled contigs was 3.1 (min = 1, max = 868), indicating reasonably good coverage depth for a half-plate 454 GS-FLX Titanium run. As expected, contig length increased as a function of coverage depth and the number of reads assembled into each contig (Supplementary Fig. S2).BLAST annotation of contig consensus and singleton sequences to a large number of unique genes indicated extensive coverage of the Z. celata floral transcriptome. Results of BLAST searches against the Uniref50 and TAIR9 databases, including the species name, accession number, identity percentage, and E-value, are presented in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, respectively. Forty-seven per cent of the contig consensus sequences had BLAST hits to annotated proteins in Uniref50, and 43% had BLAST hits to annotated proteins in TAIR9 (Table 1). Smaller percentages of the singleton sequences also had BLAST matches to the annotated protein databases (25% UniRef; 23% TAIR). Nonetheless, the large number of singleton sequences with BLAST matches (Table 1) indicates that unassembled sequences still provide an abundance of valuable sequence information and improve overall transcriptome coverage breadth. In many cases, multiple sequences representing both contigs and singletons had BLAST matches to the same protein. After correcting for redundancy, the combined set of contig consensus sequences and singleton sequences had matches to 22 707 unique proteins in Uniref50, and 16 089 unique proteins in TAIR, indicating that many Z. celata genes are represented (Table 1). Of the 13 514 unique BLAST matches of contig sequences to protein accessions in the TAIR database, 10 808 were annotated to GO terms. Of the assigned GO terms, 6083 were to biological processes, 8036 to molecular function, and 6565 to cellular components, indicating a large functional diversity of genes in the trancriptomic data. The even distribution of assignments of proteins to more specialized GO terms further indicates that the Z. celata 454 sequences represent proteins from a diverse range of functional classes (Fig. 1).

Bars represent the number of assignments of Z. celata proteins with BLAST matches in the TAIR9 database to each GO term.Many contig consensus sequences were sufficiently long to cover full or nearly full transcripts (Fig. 2). Examination of the 36 801 contigs with BLAST matches to protein-coding sequences in the TAIR9 protein database indicates that many contigs were as long as their corresponding full-length orthologous Arabidopsis transcripts (Fig. 2). As coverage depth increased, the ratio of Z. celata contig length/Arabidopsis orthologue length increased, with a large number of Z. celata contig sequences likely covering full-length transcripts (Fig. 2). This indicates that the assembly was of high quality and that we obtained extensive coverage breadth and depth for much of the floral transcriptome.

The dotted line corresponds to a ratio of 1, where 454 contigs are as long or longer than the BLAST matched A. thaliana orthologues.As expected, the vast majority of BLAST hits matched to known plant proteins (Table 2). The abundance of BLAST matches to plant-specific proteins was further indicated by sequences matching nearly as many unique proteins in searches of TAIR as those with Uniref50. There were a small number of BLAST hits to non-plant proteins (Table 2), which may be due to representation of these proteins in Uniref50 by non-plant taxa, short or poor quality consensus sequences in 454 Z. celata contigs, or because the sampled tissues contained other organisms such as pathogens. Number of unique BLAST matches to annotated proteins in different taxonomic groupsNumber of unique BLAST matches to annotated proteins in different taxonomic groupsAnnotation and BLAST searches identified six Z. celata sequences that putatively belonged to the T2 RNase gene family, five of which were isolated from contig consensus sequences and one of which was isolated from a singleton sequence. We translated these Z. celata sequences into amino acid sequences and aligned them with previously characterized, complete T2-RNase amino acid sequences from 12 plant families. Although the 5' and 3' ends of the amino acid sequences were highly variable and difficult to align across taxa, we were able to easily align ~110 highly conserved amino acids, suggesting that the six Z. celata sequences identified in this study are likely members of the T2 RNase gene family. The Z. celata T2 RNases were 115–206 residues in length (347–647 bp) and were shorter than all 12 of the complete T2 RNase sequences (which ranged from 222 to 275 residues). Alignments revealed that the Z. celata T2 RNase sequences did not span the full T2 RNase protein-coding region, as all were truncated on either the 5' or 3' end. We detected significant diversity among the six Z. celata T2 RNases, but additional analyses of these alignments will be necessary to determine whether any of these T2 RNase sequences are orthologues of S-RNase genes that encode the female component of GSI in other taxa.3.2. Molecular marker characterizationSSRs were highly abundant in the 454 DNA sequences, occurring in 17% of sequences from the combined set of contig consensus sequences and singletons. We identified 10 954 di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide repeats in the 84 465 contig consensus sequences, and an additional 33 587 SSRs in the 181 312 singleton sequences (Table 3). Although influenced by the criteria used to identify these SSRs, tri-nucleotide repeats were the most common, followed by di- and tetra- nucleotide repeats (Table 3). A total of 11 926 SSRs occurred in contigs with BLAST matches to Uniref50 annotated proteins, of which 4246 occurred in protein-coding regions of these sequences. The density of SSRs was much higher in non-coding regions that followed coding regions than in coding regions (0.0016 SSRs per basepair in coding regions vs. 0.0075 in non-coding regions). Of the three repeat motifs, di-nucleotide repeats were the most abundant in coding regions (2551), followed by tri- (1684) and tetra-nucleotide (11) repeats. Primer design was successful for a much larger percentage of contig consensus sequences (76%) than singleton sequences (23%), presumably because the shorter length of the singleton sequences limited the availability of suitable priming sites. Supplementary Tables S3 and S4 provide primer sequences, GC content, melting temperatures, expected product length, SSR motif, SSR sequence, SSR length, and sequence identification for the SSRs developed from the Z. celata 454 sequences. SNPs were also highly abundant in the Z. celata 454 contigs. Across 1.4 million bases represented by a minimum of 8× coverage, we identified 11 056 SNPs that were present at a minimum frequency of 25%, resulting in a SNP occurrence rate of 0.008 per base, similar to that reported in other 454 transcriptome studies.13,16,17Number of each type of SSRs detected in the Z. celata transcriptome.

Transcriptome assembly, coverage breadth and depth, and gene annotation454 pyrosequencing has arisen as a powerful tool for the sequencing of transcriptomes, and many studies have used de novo assembly of such data to produce and characterize genome-level resources for non-model organisms.11,13,16,23,45 Similarly, a half-plate run on the 454 GS-FLX Titanium platform provided substantial coverage of the Z. celata floral transcriptome, and de novo assembly placed a large fraction (72%) of the 454 sequences into contigs, a large number of which were of considerable length and coverage (Fig 2). BLAST hits to more than 22 000 unique proteins indicate that a large portion of the floral transcriptome was likely sequenced. The large number of diverse GO assignments of these transcripts also highlights the diversity of genes likely represented by these data. Furthermore, many contigs were as long as, or longer than, the corresponding Arabidopsis orthologues, indicating thorough transcript coverage for many genes. These sequences provide a significant genomic-level resource for an endangered plant species and plant family for which very little DNA sequence data previously existed.Nearly all of the unique BLAST matches were to proteins characterized in green plants (Table 3). A small subset, however, were to proteins characterized in other organisms, and could represent contaminant RNA in the floral tissues we sampled. In particular, a reasonably large number of matches were to plant viral genes (Table 3). However, low frequencies of BLAST hits to distantly related taxonomic groups are common in such transcriptome sequencing studies and are often attributable to factors other than contaminant RNA,13,17,45 e.g. these sequences could be short contigs containing little information, genes that have not been well characterized in plants, or novel Z. celata genes.Transcriptome sequencing studies have proven highly valuable for gene discovery, characterization, and variant analysis in both model and non-model organisms.11,16,17,46,47 Here, we detected genes expressed in the floral tissues of Z. celata that are putative members of the T2 RNase gene family, demonstrating that 454 transcriptome sequencing is a useful approach for identifying sequences belonging to specific gene families in non-model organisms. We detected significant variation among amino acid sequences within the gene family, indicating that we may have isolated multiple paralogues. Further phylogenetic analyses and analyses of protein-coding motifs for these sequences will be necessary to determine whether these sequences are orthologues or paralogues of S-RNases. If any of the sequences identified in this study encode the S-RNase gene, future research will focus on genotyping this gene in all individuals of Z. celata, which will allow us to identify rare mating types and determine the compatibility of extant genotypes in this self-incompatible species. An understanding of S-locus diversity in Z. celata will help to establish genetically diverse populations capable of reproducing sexually, thereby increasing levels of genetic diversity in this highly endangered species, with the ultimate goal of forming self-sustaining and demographically viable populations.4.2. Molecular marker characterizationThe 454 pyrosequencing and other next-generation sequencing technologies have increased the opportunity for molecular marker development in non-model study organisms at an unprecedented scale.10,16,17 In addition, the gene-based markers developed from transcriptome sequencing projects have the advantages of higher cross-species transferability.8,48 We detected and characterized an enormous number of SSR and SNP loci that will likely facilitate future evolutionary, ecological, and conservation-genetic-oriented studies in Z. celata. The primer sets developed for candidate SSRs will allow higher density genotyping that will facilitate accurate assessment of the number of extant genotypes in this species. These markers will also be used for parentage analysis of seedlings to identify the parents with the highest fitness and to ensure that translocated populations contain the highest possible levels of genetic diversity. Furthermore, if we are unable to identify the genes encoding GSI, we will employ these SSR markers to carry out parentage analysis to provide indirect estimates of compatible mating types. The thousands of high-quality SNPs contained in deeply covered contigs offer an enormous number of informative sites that will facilitate genome-wide analyses of molecular variation in future studies.4.3. ConclusionsIn this study, we characterized the floral transcriptome, isolated thousands of molecular markers, and identified transcripts that may encode the S-locus in Z. celata, a highly endangered shrub species. This work has taken an important initial step in characterizing the protein-coding portion of the genome of Z. celata, providing a substantial genomic-level resource for an endangered plant species and plant family for which little previous DNA sequence data existed. Indeed, given that very few endangered plant species have been the focus of genomic or next-generation DNA sequencing efforts, Z. celata may now have one of the best-characterized genomes of any endangered plant species. This work also highlights the utility of using next-generation sequencing for marker and gene discovery; we isolated thousands of genetic markers to be used for parentage analysis, and identified members of a specific gene family that may encode GSI in Z. celata. These resources will be employed to facilitate recovery efforts for Z. celata, highlighting the utility of the new technology in rapidly expanding the resources available to conservation biologists to aid in the recovery of highly endangered species.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the US Fish and Wildlife Service (Grant #40181AG003 to C.W.W.), the Florida Division of Forestry Plant Conservation Grants Program, and Archbold Biological Station.We thank Alex Buerkle and Johan Grahnen for assistance with data analysis, Martin Heine and staff at GATC Inc. for technical work; Stacy Smith and Megan Larson for field assistance in collecting Florida Ziziphus flower samples under difficult field conditions; David Bender for acquisition and administration of the USFWS grant; Dennis Hardin and Mike Jenkins of the Florida Division of Forestry for DOF funding, and Eric Menges, Satoshi Tabata, and two anonymous reviewers for comments on previous versions of this manuscript.Supplementary data"

IntroductionHelitrons are class II transposable elements (TEs) that are proposed to propagate by rolling circle replication (RCR) at the DNA level1 and are dependent upon the function of Replicase/Helicase (RepHel) proteins for autonomous transposition.1,2Helitrons show a high degree of sequence plasticity, such that computational predications mainly rely upon the identification of conserved 5'-CT and 3'-CTRR termini,3 a 6–20-bp stem-loop structure near the 3'-terminus,4,5 and predicted integration between AT1 or TT nucleotides.3 Non-autonomous Helitrons are small in size due to lack of an internal protein-coding region, but often remain mobile through the retention of functional trans-acting RepHel proteins.1,2 A high copy number of non-autonomous Helitrons within genomes likely results from evasion of host repression.6 The observed paucities in sequence variation among Helitrons appears indicative of recent bursts in transposition.7,8 Certain groups of class II DNA transposons and Helitrons integrate frequently in proximity to protein-coding regions9 and can affect the structure and function of genes and gene products.7,10 These integrations can result in the modification of transcriptional efficiency,11 as well as introduce transcript splice variation and polyadenylation sites, changes in transcription start and stop sites, and incorporation of novel exon sequence.12,13Helitrons are potent modifiers of genome structure and function due to frequent acquisition and transposition of host genomic DNA, which oftentimes results in exon shuffling or the duplication of gene sequences.4,14–18 The mechanism by which Helitrons acquire novel sequence remains largely unknown,19 but is hypothesized to occur at the DNA level due to transposition of both intron and exon sequences. Furthermore, Helitrons are often chimeric constructs that have acquired DNA from multiple independent loci,16,17 which may occur by a step-wise addition of novel 5'- and 3'-ends that are compatible with the minimal requirements for functioning during RCR.6,10,20 These instances indicate that class II TEs and Helitrons participate in the rearrangement and duplication of genome regions and contribute to the evolution of novel eukaryotic genome functions.21,22TE integration and excision mutations cause phenotypic variation at the individual and population scale,23,24 may be contributing factors to speciation events25,26 and provide the genetic novelties for local adaptation via natural selection.27 The insect order Lepidoptera contains the second largest number of species on earth, some of which cause widespread damage to crop plants. Short repetitive sequences and TEs are important players in the generation of genetic diversity and evolution of Lepidoptera due to integrations within genes,28,29 but the genome-wide affects of TE-derived mutations upon genetic and phenotypic variation remain relatively unknown. The silkmoth, Bombyx mori, is the lepidopteran model species whose ~420 Mb genome sequence assembly is composed of ~43.6% repetitive DNA,30 with most being <500 bp.31,32 Nearly 13% of the B. mori genome comprise short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs),33 which are class I TEs derived from tRNA, 5S rRNA or 7SL RNA-like sequences that propagate by retrotransposition.34 In contrast, DNA-based class II TEs occupy ~3% of the B. mori genome (Helitrons 0.1%),33 and are mostly located within introns and non-coding DNA of Lepidoptera.35 This dearth of TE knowledge among lepidopteran species has resulted in difficulty in interpreting their role in the generation of structural and functional genome variance.The Lep1 box is a conserved 99-bp repetitive DNA sequence originally described within intron and untranslated regions from eight lepidopteran species.36 The Lep1 box retains homology +10 to -50 of the core repeat, which was later described as the 134-bp lepidopteran-specific common sequence 3 (LSCS3).37 In the following, we annotate the Lep1 element as a Helitron-like TE and indicate that multiple novel DNA sequences have been acquired and propagated by the Lep1 Helitron. The conservation of predicted secondary structures between the ancestral Helitron and an acquired terminal region offers significant insight into the mode of Helitron propagation and features within the acquired sequence required for propagation. Lep1 Helitrons and acquired sequences co-localize with gene-coding regions in the B. mori genome, cause structural gene mutations, and are important mediators of genome-wide mutation.2. Materials and methods2.1. Annotation of the Lep1 HelitronAll annotations are made with respect to the reverse complement of the LSCS3 sequence37 that includes the 99-bp Lep1 box36 and from hereon is referred to as Lep1. Sequences showing homology to Lep1 were retrieved from the GenBank non-redundant (nr) nucleotide database via a BLASTn search that used Lep1 as the query (conducted 11-04-2010), with output filtered for =70% homology over =100 bp. Similarly, GenBank dbEST accessions for species of Lepidoptera were downloaded in FASTA format (10 November 2010), imported into a local databases using BioEdit,38 queried using Lep1, and results filtered and aligned as described previously. All lepidopteran DNA sequence accessions that passed filter criteria were downloaded in FASTA format, imported into the MEGA 5.0 sequence alignment application,39 and a multiple sequence alignment was made using the ClustalW algorithm (default parameters: gap opening penalty, 15; gap extension penalty, 6.66; weight matrix IUB, and transition weight, 0.5) in the MEGA 5.0 alignment module.39Sequence homologies flanking the Lep1 sequence were identified by performing an ‘all vs. all’ search using the BLASTn algorithm using all nr and dbEST ‘hits’ to Lep1. The regions of intraspecific DNA sequence homology were extracted from accessions using a custom PERL script, and then used as input into the Mfold DNA secondary structure server40 (http://mfold.rna.albany.edu/?q=mfold/DNA-Folding-Form) with the partial function and pair probabilities = 25°C.2.2. Estimation of Lep1 genome copy number and distributionScaffolds from the B. mori whole genome sequence build v. 2.3 were downloaded from Kaikobase (http://sgp.dna.affrc.go.jp/pubdata/genomicsequences.html; file assembledset.txt.gz) and imported into a local database using BioEdit.38 Build v. 2.3 was searched with Lep1 as the query using the BLASTn algorithm and results filtered for ‘hits’ showing =80% similarity over =50 bp. The putative BmLep1 integration positions were called the BmLep1 model v. 2.3, which was then merged with positions of the B. mori assembly v. 2.3 gene models (file: glean_cds_on_chr.gff at http://sgp.dna.affrc.go.jp/pubdata/genomicsequences.html). The combined features were displayed using CMap.41 Sequence intervals for BmLep1 elements were retrieved from the assembled B. mori scaffold for chromosome 1 (Z chromosome) using a custom PERL script, reverse complements generated using the Sequence Manipulation Suite (SMS) at http://www.bioinformatics.org/sms2/rev_comp.html, and FASTA formatted text imported into MEGA 5.0.39 A multiple sequence alignment was made for all B. mori Lep1 elements using parameters described earlier, gamma parameter estimated, and a maximum likelihood-based estimation of Lep1 phylogenetic relationship made using the general time reversible model of sequence evolution. Nucleotide sites were chosen using a partial deletion of missing characters (cut-off = 0.05), and all possible trees were interrogated using the Close-Neighbor-Interchange heuristic. Node support was acquired using 1000 bootstrap pseudoreplicates reported within a strict consensus tree.The frequency of Lep1 integrations within species of Lepidoptera was investigated using full bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) insert sequences from Bicyclus anynana, B. mori, Heliconius melpomene, H. numata, Helicoverpa armigera, Papilio dardanus, and Spodoptera frugiperda. These sequences were downloaded from NCBI, imported into BioEdit,38 and a search for Lep1 positions performed as described previously. The mean frequency of Lep1 integrations were calculated manually and significance of frequency differences among species was assessed using F-statistics (significance threshold a = 0.05).2.3. Predictions of haplotype variation caused by Lep1 elementsNucleotide accessions from the NCBI nr database were used to query derived protein sequences within the nr protein database using the blastx algorithm and results filtered for ‘hits’ showing =50% identity. Proteins derived from orthologous lepidopteran genes that were not identified within the initial Lep1 screen (see 2.1), but present within the blastx output were compared manually to predict instances of copy number variation within or between species. Lep1copy number variation at orthologous loci among species was further investigated using integration/excision variation among cadherin gene sequences from B. mori (gene model: BTGIBMGA013616), H. armigera (GenBank accession: AY714876.1), and Ostrinianubilalis (DQ000165.1). Sequences were imported into a local database in BioEdit,38 searched using with Lep1 as the query and alignment of exon 1, intron 1, and exon 2 using the MEGA 5.0 sequence alignment application39 was created as described previously.2.4. Predictions of Lep1 modification to gene structure De novoAcquisition of transcribed Lep1 sequences was performed for O. nubilalis, where total RNA was isolated from whole larvae using RNAagents kit (Promega, Madison, WI) and cDNA was synthesized using the SMART cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) according to manufacturer's instructions, RACE reactions using the CDSIII primer (Clontech) with OnLep1-f2 (5'-TAC TRA TAT TAT AAA GCT GAA GAG TT-3') and SMART V with OnLep1-r (5'-GAT AAA TGG GCT ATC TAA CAC TGA AAG-3'), and amplified according to manufacturer's instructions. PCR fragments were cloned, and sequenced using T7 and SP6 primers, and resulting sequence data were assembled into contigs using CAPs42 as described previously. Contigs were annotated using the Blast2Go suite,43,44 where the GenBank nr protein database was interrogated using the BLASTx algorithm.3. Results and discussion3.1. Annotation of the Lep1 HelitronA conserved 99-bp Lep1 box was previously described in eight lepidopteran species3,6 and later described as portion of a 134-bp consensus LSCS3.3,7 Our homology-based searches of the GenBank nr/nt database resulted in the estimation of 618 regions within 210 nucleotide sequence accessions from Lepidoptera that show =70.0% similarity to Lep1 (32 species; mean similarity: 80.3 ± 5.8% over 120.5 ± 19.0 bp; Supplementary Table S1). Eighteen of these Lep1-containing accessions were annotated as microsatellite loci and 51 Lep1s were within introns or untranslated regions of known genes. The remaining 526 Lep1s were within un-annotated sequences from BAC full inserts of the lepidopteran species B. mori, B. anynana, S. frugiperda, H. armigera, H. melpomene, H. erato and P. dardanus. An analogous search of the GenBank dbEST database identified 443 accessions from lepidopteran species that showed =71.1% interspecific similarity with 84 of these dbEST hits being =130 bp (Supplementary Table S2). Multiple sequence alignment of GenBank nr/nt and dbEST accessions that contained full-length Lep1 elements resulted in a 197-bp consensus that shared Helitron-like 5'-CT and 3'-CTRY termini,1 and were, respectively, designated as region H1 and region H2 of Lep1 (Fig. 1A). The nucleotides directly adjacent to the 5'- and 3'-ends consisted of TA or AA in 96.2% of predicted Lep1s and showed not discernable target site duplications which are consistent with previously described Helitron genomic integration events.1,3,7Alignment of Lep1 Helitron sequences from species of Lepidoptera.

In addition to 5'-CT and 3'-CTRY termini, the formation of a 3'-stem-loop (hairpin) near the 3'-terminus are hallmarks of Helitron TEs and suggest important roles of these structures in RCR or genome integration.6,10,20 A second conserved stem-loop (hairpin) structure was predicted from B. mori and H. melpomene Lep1s that we designated the 5'-inverted repeat (5'-IR). This 5'-IR involves base pairing between portions of the 5'-subterminal inverted repeat (SIRa) and the microsatellite loop, and are analogous to the 5'-IR formed by the Helitron-like Drosophila interspersed nuclear element (DINE-1) family of TEs7 and the lepidopteran microsatellite associated interspersed nuclear element (MINE-1).35 Specifically, the B. mori GenBank accession D86623.1 is predicted to have a 7-bp 5'-IR formed by a portion of the 5'-SIRa sequence [ACTAATATT-7nt-GGAAAGATTTGTTT] (nucleotides involved in intramolecular base pairing are underlined; <U+0394>G = –0.83 kcal mol-1; Fig. 2A), and the 6 bp 5'-IR in H. melpomene Lep1s are formed between later six nucleotides of the 5'-SIRa and the (GTTT)n microsatellite loop (<U+0394>G = –0.99 kcal mol-1; Fig. 2B). The conservation of hairpin structures adjacent to both the 5'- and 3'-termini among 460 of 618 (74.4%) of Lep1s predicted among nr database accessions suggests a role in the RepHel protein recognition, nascent strand cleavage, or other portion of the RCR mechanism,5,7,10,18,20 but further investigation is required to elucidate their role. The secondary structure conserved among Lep1 elements. (A) Bombyx mori GenBank accession D86623.1 and (B) Heliconius melpomene GenBank accession CR974474.4 positions 69 560–69 971. Helitron-like features include 5'-CT and 3'-CTRY termini, a 3'-stem-loop is located two to three nucleotides upstream of the 3'-CTRY terminus (nucleotide with parallel grey bars), and a 5'-SIR that is complementary to a 3'-SIR (nucleotide with parallel black bars). Nucleotides involved in the formation of a 5'-IR are paralleled by yellow bars and the structure is shown within the boxed area for H. melpomene.The secondary structure conserved among Lep1 elements.

Nucleotides involved in the formation of a 5'-IR are paralleled by yellow bars and the structure is shown within the boxed area for H. melpomene.Structural predictions for Lep1 further indicated that intramolecular base pairing may occur between nucleotides immediately downstream of the 5'-CT and a region 26–37 nt upstream of the 3'-CTRY terminus and involve interaction of the SIRa. Specifically, nucleotides of the 5'-SIRa from B. mori accession D86623.1 [ACTAATATT-7nt-ATAAAGATTTGTTT] are predicted to pair with the 3'-SIRa [AAAATTCTTTTCCATTAGA] located 49 bp downstream (nucleotides involved in base pairing are underlined in; <U+0394>G = –5.92 kcal mol-1; Fig. 1A). Analogous structures were predicted from H. melpomene (Figs 1A and 2B) as well as all other full-length Lep1s (Fig. 1A; all data not shown). These molecular interactions of Lep1 contribute to an overall secondary structure that is stable at 25°C for B. mori (<U+0394>G = –19.74 kcal mol-1) and H. melpomene (<U+0394>G = –11.90 kcal mol-1; Fig. 2), and is analogous to the structure formed by the MINE-1 Helitron from Lepidoptera.353.2. Annotation of acquired end sequencesHelitrons modify the structure of genomes through the acquisition and transposition of novel DNA sequence that occurs by a largely unresolved mechanism.19,20 We described the consensus Lep1 element sequence from 31 accession for species of Lepidoptera that shared Helitron-like termini at the border of regions H1 and H2 (Fig. 1A), but also identified 62–342-bp sequence regions downstream of the 3'-CTRY terminus at the boundary of region H2 that are shared within a species. The novel shared sequences downstream of the 3'-CTRY were referred to as region H3. Specifically, the region H3 showed =62.3% similarity between species and =95.7% similarity within a species or closely related species such as between the 55- and 59-bp region H3 from Helicoverpa species H. armigera (GenBank accession: FP340429.1) and H. zea (EU327673.1; Fig. 1B). Among region H3 sequences from the same species or closely related species, sequence similarity terminated at a ubiquitous 3'-CTAG motif that was followed by a thymidine nucleotide (T; Figs 1B and 3), and only one variant of the H3 region was described within a species. The Lep1s predicted from the B. mori genome assembly shows two unique 87- or 335-bp sequences within region H3 that were, respectively, represented by GenBank accessions: DQ242656.1 and D86623.1 (Fig. 1B). The B. mori Lep1 Helitrons with an 87- or 335-bp region H3 were subsequently called BmLep1_87 and BmLep1_335 variants, respectively, and alignments showed no discernable homology (Fig. 3). Phylogenetic reconstruction of B. mori Lep1_87 and _335-bp Helitron variants from chromosome 1 suggested that two weakly supported clades may exist, which indicated that Lep1s have evolved independently within the B. mori genome through the acquisition of two different downstream sequences (Supplementary Fig. S2; gamma parameter rate distribution <U+03B3> = 3.9894; Log likelihood = D = –3729.34). Independent gain of sequence mutations has previously been identified for Helitrons in the maize genome6,10,20 and indicate that arthropod genomes are also modified by Helitron movements. Alignment of nucleotides for secondary structure of Bombyx mori Lep1 Helitrons. The 5'-SIR form alternate hairpin structures with either a 5'-invered repeat (5'-IR; yellow arrows) or a 3'-SIR within the Lep1 consensus Helitron (black arrows), as well as a 3'-SIR within the acquired Helitron end sequence (red arrows) within both the 87- and 355-bp acquired regions. Two hairpins are formed, one at the 3'-terminus of the Lep1 Helitron and one within each of the 87- or 335-bp acquired Helitron end sequence (grey arrows). The 3'-termini of the ancestral Lep1 Helitron and the acquired end sequences are, respectively, composed of CTAY and CTAG motifs (yellow highlighted nucleotides).Alignment of nucleotides for secondary structure of Bombyx mori Lep1 Helitrons.

The 3'-termini of the ancestral Lep1 Helitron and the acquired end sequences are, respectively, composed of CTAY and CTAG motifs (yellow highlighted nucleotides).Although the sequences in region H3 share little interspecific sequence similarity, the secondary structures predicted to form appear to be identical by state with those formed in region H2. Specifically, the 7–9-bp 3'-stem-loops (hairpins), respectively, formed in region H3 of BmLep1_87 and BmLep1_335 Helitrons (<U+0394>G = –7.90 kcal mol-1) are more highly stable compared with the analogous structure in the ancestral region H2 (<U+0394>G = –2.99 kcal mol-1; Fig. 3). This evidence may suggest that Helitrons are dependent upon a 3'-stem-loop directly upstream of the 3'-CTAG terminus for RCR function,5 and that acquired sequences undergo selection for the capacity to support propagation by RCR.20 A functional switch from use of ancestral to derived Lep1 Helitron ends may have been influenced by the comparatively higher stability we predicted for 3'-stem-loops within the Lep1 acquired sequence. Thereby, functional shifts could occur when equally or more efficient terminal structure are encountered by change within flanking DNA or swapped between other Helitrons. In contrast, reduction in 3'-stem-loop stability in region H2 also could have resulted from degradation following the relaxation of selective constraints, and would mirror the degradation of a Helitron-like 3'-CTAG terminus that followed accretion by maize Helitrons.20Additionally, intramolecular base pairings we predicted between the 5'-SIRa (region H1) and 3'-SIRa (region H2; Fig. 1A) are analogously formed through interaction of nucleotides within the 5'-SIRa of the ancestral Lep1 region H1 and a 3'-SIRb within the derived region H3 (Fig. 1B). These interactions between the 5'-SIRb and 3'-SIRb in B. mori Lep1_87 and _335-bp Helitrons (<U+0394>G = -2.56 kcal mol-1) is lower than between the 5'-SIRa and 3'-SIRa (<U+0394>G = -5.92 kcal mol-1; Fig. 3), but remain consistent with the characteristic secondary structures described previously for insect Helitrons.7,45 The formation of a hairpin between the 5'-SIR and 3'-SIRs within both the ancestral and acquired regions indicates that, in addition to the 3'-stem-loop structure, the base pairing between SIRs at proximal and distal ends of Lep1 may potentially be required from RCR. Furthermore, the requirement for a 3'-SIR within the independently acquired DNA sequences in proximity to a 3'-CTAG novel terminal motif could suggest that gain of sequence mutations by Lep1 may be rare. This hypothesis could be supported by our description of two Helitron variations in the B. mori genome, which contrasts with the high number of cryptic Helitrons from the maize genome where functional constraints appear to be relaxed.17The described accretion by lepidopteran Helitrons involves sequences that are relatively small and added in a unidirectional fashion. DNA sequence upstream of the single 5'-CT terminal motif showed no homology among integrations in lepidopteran genomes or conserved secondary structures that would be indicative of a chimeric Helitron.46 These observations are analogous to those described by Yang and Bennetzen.8Lep1 was not shown to capture entire genes, but may be due to inability to accurately describe haplotype variation from available data resources or the possible culling of the mutations from genomes due to negative affects on genome function.47 Smaller non-autonomous Helitrons are better able to evade host repression6 or show greater replication efficiency within the RCR mechanism.48Lep1s also appears to gain sequence only at the 3' end, which contrasts with bidirectional end creation by maize Helitrons.20 This directionality of Lep1s may result from the preferential capture that is known to occur in the same orientation as the RepHel-coding sequence of the autonomous Helitron, but this cannot be ascertained until further research is preformed to identify the parent TE of the non-autonomous Lep1 element.3.3. Lep1 copy number and genome distributionThe variation in non-autonomous Helitrons copy number among species of Lepidoptera may result from differential effects of replicative repression via DNA methylation,49 mutation-selection balance within the overall genome architecture,50 or random genetic drift at the population scale. We showed that Lep1 Helitron integration densities range from 1.04 × 10-5 to 1.8 × 10-4 based upon annotation of full BAC insert sequences. These estimates indicated that Lep1s have an ~13-fold copy number difference across species' genomes (Table 1), and is comparable to the ~11-fold variance observed among DINE-1 insertions within Drosophila genomes.7 The highest Lep1 copy number density was estimated for the butterfly P. dardanus, wherein Lep1 abundance was significantly higher than for all other species except for B. anynana (P-values =0.0089; Student's-t values not shown). The mean Lep1 integration density among butterflies (6.9 × 10-5 ± 6.8 × 10-5) is not significantly different from the densities estimated among moth species (mean: 2.5 × 10-5 ± 2.0 × 10-5; F-statistic = 1.4; d.f.num = 1; d.f.den = 2; P-value = 0.3583).

Respective GenBank accessions and positional information is provided in Supplementary Table S1.Estimated frequency of Lep1 Helitrons per mega base (Mb) in species of LepidopteraEstimates from BAC full-insert sequences. Respective GenBank accessions and positional information is provided in Supplementary Table S1.The only whole genome sequence available for use to directly estimate the TE frequencies in Lepidoptera is the 432 Mb B. mori assembly (build v.2.3),30 from which we estimated 5541 putative BmLep1 integrations. Each putative BmLep1 Helitron was assigned a unique identifier (BmLep1_000001 to BmLep1_005541), and further categorized as containing either the BmLep1_87 or BmLep1_335 variant downstream sequence described previously (Supplementary Table S3). The ancestral regions of the Lep1 Helitron (regions H1 thru H2;) within build v. 2.3 showed =94.3 ± 1.9% similarity with the B. mori Lep1 elements from accessions DQ242656.1 and D86623.1 (Fig. 1B). This paucity of Lep1 sequence evolution within the B. mori genome may indicate a recent burst in transposition,7,8 or a high degree of functional conservation. The density of B. mori Lep1s estimated from the genome sequence (1.3 × 10-5) is ~2-fold lower than that estimated from BAC full inserts (2.5 × 10-5; Table 1), and highlights the error that may be associated with subsampling from BAC sequences. Mapping the positions of BmLep1 onto chromosome assemblies indicated that integrations are co-localized with protein-coding genes (Supplementary Fig. S1; chromosome 1 shown in Fig. 4), which agrees with seminal evidence of Lep1 being within gene intervals.36 Furthermore, Lep1 proximity to B. mori gene-coding regions suggests that Lep1s may affect gene structure and function on a genome-wide scale.9,20 The effects of Lep1 Helitron integrations upon gene structure and function are for the first time presented in Section 3.4.

Lep1 elements modify gene structureThe movement and propagation of TEs introduce haplotype variation,51 and alter gene functions when integrated within coding regions of a genome.28 TEs are present within insect ESTs52 and mature transcripts of D. melanogaster,53 and can cause alternative the modification of cis-regulatory function,54 introduction of frameshift and premature stop codon mutations,28 and be involved in exon shuffling18 or insertion of introns.55 Evidence that Lep1s co-localize with protein-coding genes in B. mori genome (section 3.3) suggests that integrations may affect the structure and function of lepidopteran genes, and that presence/absence mutation at orthologous loci may be a source of function genetic variation among species. Comparison among orthologs of the cadherin gene from B. mori, H. armigera, and O. nubilalis genomes showed that Helitron copy number variation is present. Specifically, a nucleotide sequence with 68.7% similarity to the Lep1 consensus was predicted within the H. armigera cadherin intron 1, whereas orthologous introns from B. mori or O. nubilalis show no Lep1-like sequence (Fig. 5A). Although the effects of this integration upon gene function was not investigated, TE integrations within introns are known to affect splicing efficiencies56 and indicated that Lep1s are a source of genome copy number variation between lepidopteran species.

(B) Integration of a Lep1 element within the O. nubilalis allatotropin neuropeptide precursor gene that is compared with the Spodoptera frugiperda homolog (AJ566903.1) (integration is underscored by <). Gaps in the alignment and missing data are represented by - and *, respectively.Analogously, Lep1 Helitron integrations were described within cDNA-RACE products from 46 O. nubilalis clones (29.6 kb total; mean insert size: 616.1 ± 244.5 bp; GenBank accessions: JG732059–JG732089; JG744027–JG744041). Sequence from RACE products were assembled into 8 contigs and 14 singletons (3.56 ± 1.94 reads per contig), and 21 of these contigs were subsequently annotated as having a Lep1 integration (Supplementary Fig. S3). Functional annotation of these contigs indicated that all transcript-derived O. nubilalis Lep1 Helitrons were within intron or untranslated regions (data not shown), with the exception of contig04. Contig04 was predicted to show 85% amino acid similarity to the S. frugiperda allatotropin neuropeptide (at2a; GenBank accession CAD98809.1) and that a Lep1 Helitron integration had occurred within the protein-coding regions in the O. nubilalis ortholog (Fig. 5B). When compared to the 53 aa S. frugiperda at2a gene sequence, the C-terminal 37 aa of the 64 residue O. nubilalis ortholog was predicted to be encoded by regions H2 and H3 of an integrated Lep1 Helitron (Fig. 5B). The integration inserted a novel protein-coding sequence that contains a TAA stop codon and changed the predicted molecular weight and isoelectric point of the O. nubilalis at2 protein (pI ~10.87; 13.6 kDa) compared with that of S. frugiperda (pI = 11.4; 6.1 kDa). The affect of these changes on protein function was not investigated further, but indicated that the Lep1 Helitron can affect the structure and function of gene coding sequences in Lepidoptera.In conclusion, a comparative genomics approach was used to identify novel sequences acquired by the highly conserved ancestral Lep1 Helitron. Although the primary sequence among gained sequences are variable, a conservation of secondary structures showed that sequence identity by state is an important factor in determining the success of acquired genomic regions for in subsequent transposition events within the genome. Lep1 provides insight into the structural requirements for RCR in animal Helitrons. Furthermore, the prevalence and preference of Lep1 integrations in proximity to gene-coding regions shows that this class of Helitrons impacts the structure and function of genomes in which they reside.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the USDA Current Research Information System (CRIS) project number 3625-22000-017-00D.This research was a joint contribution of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA), Agricultural Research Service and the Iowa State University outreach station, Ames, IA (Project 3543).

IntroductionTheobroma cacao L. is a diploid species (2n = 2x = 20) with a small genome ranging in size from 411 to 494 Mb.1 According to Cheesman,2 its centre of origin is at the lower eastern equatorial slopes of the Andes.Theobroma cacao is grown as a major cash crop that provides income to 14 million small-scale farmers in more than 50 tropical countries. However, cocoa production is markedly affected by a number of major diseases caused by several Phytophthora species, or by Moniliophthora perniciosa and Moniliophthora roreri. Several sources of disease resistance have been identified and the search for sustainable disease resistance by cumulating the different resistance genes is one of the major challenges facing T. cacao-breeding programmes.3 The quality of chocolate is another important trait in cocoa breeding, and consumer demand for high-quality chocolate is increasing. A better understanding of the molecular and genetic bases of these traits is a key goal of cocoa genetic research.High-density genetic maps are essential tools for trait genetic studies. Several molecular marker types have been developed in T. cacao in recent decades: restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), microsatellites or simple sequence repeats (SSRs), random amplified polymorphic DNA, amplified fragment length polymorphism and isozymes.4–6 Among them, only RFLP, SSR and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) are co-dominant markers, and therefore more powerful for genetic analyses. Compared with RFLP, the advantage of SSR and SNP markers is that they can be revealed using high-throughput technologies with scant amounts of DNA. Semagn et al.7 made a detailed comparison of the characteristics of each kind of marker. A high-density cocoa linkage map enriched with SSR genomic markers, including only co-dominant markers, was developed by Pugh et al.8 More recently, that map was supplemented with 114 EST-SSRs.9In recent years, the use of SNP markers has substantially increased in plant genetics such as in Arabidopsis,10 grapevine,11 wheat,12 and also a few woody perennial species.13–15 SNP is one of the most abundant types of DNA sequence polymorphism and the SNP markers are suitable for large-scale genome analysis using high-throughput automated genotyping techniques. SNPs have been used to construct high-resolution genetic maps16,17 or to trace evolution, particularly in the human genome, using large-scale SNP datasets.18,19 Knowledge of nucleotide substitution dynamics is an important basis for molecular evolutionary studies, phylogeny reconstruction and natural selection studies.20,21 Transitions are generally observed with higher frequencies than transversions. During natural selection, transitions are better tolerated because they generate more likely synonymous mutations in protein-coding sequences than transversions.22–25Of existing SNP markers, EST-SNPs (i.e. SNPs located within a gene expressed sequence) are of particular interest for studying functional genetic diversity and identifying candidate genes as the functional base of quantitative trait loci (QTLs). EST-SNPs have been developed for numerous plant models such as melon,26,27Brassica rapa,28 barley,29 poplar,14 and sugarcane30 to detect QTLs for many traits and facilitate the selection of resistant and productive plants. In T. cacao, a few SNPs were detected in ESTs from expression libraries representing T. cacao/M. perniciosa interactions.31In our study, we discovered and mapped several hundred EST-SNP markers detected in an exhaustive collection of cocoa ESTs32 homologous to genes with a known function. These SNP markers were supplemented by 163 new SSR markers to construct a very high-density genetic map suitable for large-scale genetic studies.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Plant materialSNP polymorphisms were screened in a collection of diverse germplasm representing the major part of the T. cacao diversity and two existing mapping populations denominated UPA402 × UF676 and F2.The collection of diverse germplasm consisted of 249 genotypes from various genetic groups and geographical origins (Table 1). Most of these accessions are maintained at the International Cocoa Genebank (ICG) at the Cocoa Research Unit (CRU), University of the West Indies, Trinidad and Tobago. Theobroma cacao genotypes of various geographical origins used to screen the polymorphism of the 1536 GoldenGate SNP panelTheobroma cacao genotypes of various geographical origins used to screen the polymorphism of the 1536 GoldenGate SNP panelThe UPA402 × UF676 mapping population consisted of 264 individuals derived from a cross of two unrelated heterozygous tree accessions; UPA402, an Upper Amazon Forastero from Peru, and UF676, a Trinitario (Forastero × Criollo hybrid) selected in Costa Rica. This progeny was maintained by Centre National de Recherche Agronomique (CNRA) in Bingerville and Divo, Côte d'Ivoire. It was used to establish genetic map as a reference in our laboratory.4,6,8,9 We mapped the new SSR and SNP markers in this population.The F2 second progeny of 132 individuals was obtained by selfing a hybrid between two heterozygous parents: Scavina 6, an Upper Amazon Forastero collected in Peru, and ICS1, a Trinitario selected in Trinidad. This progeny was produced by Comissão Executiva do Plano da Lavoura Cacaueira (CEPLAC) at Itabuna, Brazil.Most of the ESTs screened for SNPs had been obtained from the contrasting genotypes Scavina 6, an upper Amazon Forastero genotype from Peru and ICS1, a Trinitario selected in Trinidad, a hybrid between a Criollo from Central America and a Forastero from Lower Amazonia of Brazil.These two genotypes, which represent the three distinct genetic origins, Upper Amazon Forastero, Lower Amazon Forastero, and Criollo, were also the parents of the F2 population from Brazil used to map SNPs.Eleven other genotypes were involved in the construction of the cDNA libraries and SNP identification: B97-CC2, a Criollo from Belize, P7, IMC47, UPA 134, Upper Amazon Forastero genotypes from Peru, Jaca, an Upper Amazon Forastero from Brazil, GU255V, collected in French Guiana, B240 and 33–49, two Nacional genotypes from Ecuador, UF676, UF273, two Trinitario, and seedlings from a hybrid selected in Papua New Guinea.SSRs were screened in three T. cacao genotypes: the two parents of the reference map (UPA402 and UF676), and the sequenced Criollo genotype (B97-61/B2).2.2. DNA extraction and purificationGenomic DNA was extracted according to a protocol using MATAB buffer already described for the isolation of genomic DNA.6 DNA was resuspended with 1 ml of TE (10 mM Tris–HCl and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0).DNA was purified with the Nucleobond® PC 20 kit (Macherey-Nagel, Cat. No. 740.571.100) with the modification that steps 1 and 2 were omitted and the DNA was purified directly after its isolation. A 1 ml mixture composed of 200 µl of crude DNA (20 µg DNA maximum), 450 µl water and 350 µl S3 buffer + RNAse (buffers provided with the kit) was passed through the column (step 3). This solution was homogenized on a rocking table for at least 1 h. After precipitation of the eluate with an equal volume of isopropyl alcohol, the pellet was resuspended in 70 µl of TE.The quality and quantity of DNA were first checked on 0.8% agarose gel, compared with a standard range, and then the Quant-iT™ PicoGreen® dsDNA Assay from Invitrogen™ was used. A quality test was performed for each sample by amplifying microsatellite markers in a PCR mixture with a high DNA concentration (100 ng DNA in a 10 µl reaction volume). The purification step was repeated when the amplification failed.2.3. In silico SNP discovery and verificationA collection of 149 650 ESTs (EMBL accession number CU469588 to CU633156), corresponding to 48 594 unigenes, was produced after sequencing 56 cDNA libraries constructed from material collected from different organs, genotypes, and under different environmental conditions.32SNPs were detected in silico and quality checked using the QualitySNP pipeline,33 as reported in Argout et al.32 and in ESTtik (http://esttik.cirad.fr).QualitySNP uses quality information related to each EST and a haplotype-based strategy to predict reliable SNPs. In order to detect SNPs in known homologous coding sequences, we selected contigs displaying a significant similarity with proteins from a non-redundant protein sequence database (NR), with entries from GenPept, Swissprot, PIR, PDF, PDB, and NCBI RefSeq, and as described in Argout et al.322.4. Validation of SNPs via golden gate assayA total of 30–50 ng of genomic DNA per plant was used for Illumina SNP genotyping with the Illumina BeadArray platform at the French National Genotyping Centre (CNG, CEA-IG, Evry, France), according to the GoldenGate Assay manufacturer's protocol. Three 3-day assays were carried out to genotype the progeny samples for the 1536 SNP set revealed by the GoldenGate assay (Supplementary Table S1). The protocol was similar to that briefly described by Hyten et al.34 except for the number of oligonucleotides involved in a single DNA reaction, thus comprising 4608 custom oligos assembled in the oligo pooled assays (OPA) designed by Illumina Inc. Raw hybridization, intensity data processing, clustering, and genotype calling were performed using the genotyping module in the BeadStudio/GenomeStudio package (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Illumina has developed a self-normalization algorithm that relies on information contained in each array, as described by Akhunov et al.35The clustering and genotype calling of each of the 1536 SNP markers were checked for their conformity and correct genotype distribution using known homozygous and heterozygous genotypes, included in the collection of diverse genotypes, as standards.2.5. SSR in silico discovery and genotypingThe MIcroSAtellite identification tool (MISA http://pgrc.ipk-gatersleben.de/misa) was used to perform SSR searches, and primers were designed with Primer3 software.36Primers flanking microsatellite loci were designed at each end of the scaffolds to orient and anchor them to the genetic map.SSRs identified in the scaffolds were mapped only on the reference map established from the UPA402 × UF676 cross.A total of 409 primer pairs (Supplementary Table S2) were defined in the 100 larger non-anchored scaffolds using Primer3 software36 and screened for their ability to segregate in the UPA402 × UF676 progeny.For a given SSR locus, the forward primer was designed with a 5'-end M13 tail (5'-CACGACGTTGTAAAACGAC-3'). PCR amplifications were performed in a Mastercycler ep384 thermocycler (Eppendorf, Germany) with 5 ng of purified DNA in a 10 µl final volume of buffer containing 10 mM Tris–HCl (pH 8), 50 mM KCl, 0.001% glycerol, 2.0 mM MgCl2, 0.08 µM of the M13-tailed forward primer, 0.1 µM of the reverse primer, 200 µM of dNTP, 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, USA), 0.1 µM of M13 primer-fluorescent dye 6-FAM™, NED®, VIC®, or PET® (Applied Biosystems, CA, USA). The DNA and buffer were distributed in 384 plates using a Biomek NX automatic pipetting robot (Beckman Coulter, CA, USA). The touchdown PCR programme used was as follows: initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 min, followed by 10 cycles at 95°C for 45 s, Tm of 56–46°C (-1°C/cycle) for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min 30 s. After these cycles, an additional round of 25 cycles were performed at 95°C for 45 s, Tm of 50°C for 1 min, and 72°C for 1 min, with a final elongation step at 72°C for 30 min.PCR products were diluted specifically for each dye and pooled for multiplex SSR genotyping (revealing two SSRs having different sizes of amplified product per dye). A mixture of 15 µl of Hi-Di™ formamide (Applied Biosystems) and 0.12 µl of size marker GeneScan™ 600-LIZ-Size® Standard V2.0. (Applied Biosystems) was added to 2 µl of the diluted PCR pool. This pool was then analysed using the ABI 3500xL automatic sequencer (Applied Biosystems).Images were analysed using Genemapper 4.0 software (Applied Biosystems) and exported as a data table.2.6. Genetic mappingThe UPA402 × UF676 population was the result of a cross between two heterozygous cocoa clones, UPA402 (<U+2640>) an Upper-Amazon Forastero and UF676 (<U+2642>) a Trinitario. In this case, there were three segregation possibilities: loci that were homozygous for one parent and heterozygous for the other, segregation (1:1), and those that segregated in both parents (1:2:1 or 1:1:1:1).Segregations were checked for goodness-of-fit to the expected Mendelian ratio using a chi-square test at significance levels of 0.05 and 0.01.Individual and consensus maps were constructed using Joinmap software, version 4.0.37Joinmap is able to combine data of several segregation types to construct a consensus genetic map. Here we used population type CP for the UPA402 × UF676 map, and population type F2 for the F2 population from Brazil. A lod score of 6 was used to identify 10 linkage groups (LGs) independently for each map. A consensus genetic map was established from the two distinct genetic maps. The corresponding groups were associated in pairs with JoinMap software. The Kosambi mapping function, with a lod score of 5 and a jump threshold of 3, was used to convert recombination frequencies into map distances.38This consensus map combined the new EST-SNPs and genomic SSRs defined from the scaffolds, in addition to the previously mapped markers.9 This map contained only markers with a known nucleotide sequence.3. Results3.1. Identification of SNPs and development of the golden gate assayThe assembly made from the 149 650 T. cacao EST sequences (see Materials and Methods) generated 12692 T. cacao contigs. The number of ESTs per contig ranged from 2 to 5102. To detect good quality in silico SNPs, we assumed that contigs with more than 100 members contained paralogous sequences.13,39 We therefore first selected 4818 contigs that contained at least 4 but no more than 100 EST members. A total of 5246 SNPs were identified in silico in 2012 contigs.We selected 4150 in silico SNPs detected in 1834 contigs that had a significant BlastX annotation similarity with known proteins of the NCBI non-redundant protein sequence database (NR) with entries from GenPept, Swissprot, PIR, PDF, PDB, and NCBI RefSeq, and as described in Argout et al.323.2. SNP performance and qualityThe set of 4150 in silico SNPs was selected in the EST contigs and the SNP-harbouring sequences were then submitted to Illumina for processing using the Illumina® Assay Design Tool (ADT). ADT generates scores for each SNP that can range from 0 to 1; SNPs with scores >0.6 have a high probability of being converted into a successful genotyping assay. In the set of 4150 submitted SNPs, 83.5% showed a high conversion success rate (>0.6), 9.2% showed a moderate conversion success rate (between 0.4 and 0.6), and 7.3% showed either a low conversion success rate or no score. A total of 1536 SNP sites having ADT scores >0.4 and without any other SNPs within the adjacent 60 bp was selected for the OPA design (Supplementary Table S1).3.3. Analysis of base changesOne thousand and forty-four in silico SNPs (68%) were transitions and 462 (32%) were transversions (Table 2). This ratio of transition/transversion SNPs tallies with the results observed in other plant species, where transition SNPs are always more frequent than transversion SNPs.

SNP polymorphismFrom the 1536 SNPs, 841 (55%) with a non-ambiguous polymorphic pattern across accessions were retained as true and verified SNPs and denominated TcSNP. Of the rest, 113 (7%) failed to be genotyped, 436 (28%) had a monomorphic pattern, and 146 (10%) were polymorphic but did not show any clear fluorescent pattern suitable for reliable genotype classification.Of the 841 polymorphic SNPs, 461 segregated in the mapping population (UPA402 × UF676) and could be mapped on the reference map. Five hundred and thirty-one were polymorphic and mapped on the F2 population map. Two hundred and thirty-nine SNP markers were segregating in both maps, thus enabling construction of a consensus map between them.3.5. SSR polymorphismA high-density genetic map is a key tool to order the scaffold assembly needed to generate a complete cocoa genome sequence. SSR markers were defined in the largest non-anchored scaffolds in order to improve anchoring of the T. cacao genome assembly provided by the International Cocoa Genome Sequencing consortium1 on the genetic map.From the 409 screened SSRs (Supplementary Table S2), 163 were polymorphic for the UPA402 × UF676 progeny and could be mapped.The new SSR markers defined from scaffolds were named mTcCIR450 to mTcCIR613 to extend the previously identified SSR marker series; mTcCIR 1 to mTcCIR 2918 from genomic DNA and mTcCIR 292 to mTcCIR 4479 from ESTs.3.6. Individual genetic linkage mapsA new set of 624 markers with their corresponding sequences, including 461 EST-SNP and 163 new SSR markers located on scaffolds of the genome assembly,1 were added to the reference map (Fig. 1, Supplementary Table S3).

Consensus genetic linkage mapTwo hundred and thirty-nine SNP markers were mapped in both populations.The complete consensus map (Table 5) contained 1262 codominant markers including 681 EST-SNPs, 523 SSRs (163 scaffold-tagged-SSRs, 110 EST-SSRs, 250 SSRs from genomic DNA) and 58 RFLPs including 14 resistance gene analogues (Rgenes-RFLPs), arranged in 10 LGs corresponding to the haploid chromosome number of T. cacao (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S5).

The average distance between adjacent markers on this map was 0.6 cM, and thus shorter than the 1.3 cM of the map of Fouet et al.9The number of mapped loci varied substantially between LGs on the consensus map; from 63 in LG10 to 201 in LG1. The average distance between two markers in the different LGs ranged from 0.4 cM in LG1 to 0.9 cM in LG10.In total, 844 new markers (681 SNP markers and 163 SSR defined in scaffolds) were mapped. These new markers were well distributed over all chromosomes allowing to fill some gaps in the previous maps, for example on chromosome 10.4. DiscussionA large set of EST-SNP markers was generated and mapped in T. cacao. New SSR markers were added to these SNPs, providing an efficient tool for high-throughput genotyping of cocoa populations.SSR markers are multiallelic and well adapted for fine analysis of population diversity structure.40–43 In T. cacao, an average number of 5.8 alleles per SSR was observed by Loor Solorzano44 after genotyping a collection of genetic resources of various genetic origins, and with a maximum of 15 alleles revealed by one SSR (mTcCIR322). This is not the case for SNPs that are only biallelic, but a higher number of SNP markers (several thousands) can be easily revealed at once using high-throughput technologies.We used our new SNP and SSR markers to construct a very high-density genetic map. Sixty-five per cent of the markers were from within genes and the average distance between adjacent markers was 0.6 cM.Several chromosome regions include markers with skewed segregations, particularly on LG 1, LG 3, LG 4, and LG 6. The region on LG 4 includes the locus for self-incompatibility previously identified by Crouzillat et al.5 The gameto-sporophytic incompatibility system existing in T. cacao45,46 could possibly explain the segregation distortion on this LG 4 region. Other factors which could explain segregation distortion, such as chromosome rearrangements in banana47 which are responsible for highly skewed marker segregations, have not been reported in T. cacao.This high-density genetic map can be used as a major tool for efficient genome-wide association studies (GWASs) in T. cacao populations. This method, first applied in human and animal genetics,48–51 was also found to be highly effective for studying the determinism of useful traits in plants,52–56 particularly in cocoa with the analysis of some recent hybrid populations.8,57,58 GWAS is an alternative to QTL analyses in cross progenies for the purpose of studying genetic control of phenotypic traits in cocoa.GWASs can be carried out on unrelated genetic resources such as wild or cultivated populations or germplasm collections. Large cocoa germplasm collections are maintained in many countries and characterized for useful traits. Two international cocoa collections are hosted at the International Cocoa Genebank, Trinidad (ICG,T, preserving 2300 accessions),59 and at the Centro Agronomico Tropical de Investigacion y Ensenanza, Turrialba, Costa Rica (CATIE, preserving 1150 accessions).60 The markers identified here will now certainly facilitate such GWASs, providing added-value to this wide characterization work, thus boosting knowledge on the genetic determinants of useful cocoa traits.Another benefit of this large set of mapped markers is the possible integration of molecular information in conventional cocoa breeding schemes using marker-assisted selection (MAS).In cocoa, few MAS experiments are currently underway.3,61 The efficiency of MAS in selecting P. palmivora-resistant cocoa plants has been reported by Lanaud et al.3Until now, MAS studies have mainly been focused on traits controlled by a small number of genes, using only markers close to QTLs. However, such methods are of limited use for traits that are determined by a large number of genes of small effects.Substantial genome-wide molecular data can now be generated at lower cost by high-throughput technologies, such as SNP genotyping. This progress has paved the way for the development of new methods to predict genotype value via MAS. The genome-wide selection or genomic selection (GS) method was recently successfully applied in animal or plant breeding62–66 and allows to predict phenotypes using all marker information.The integration of molecular markers in cocoa recurrent breeding programmes67–72 could be facilitated by the GS approach in order to accelerate genetic gains. The GS strategy seems particularly suitable for the selection of multigenic traits such as yield and disease resistance. Cumulating a large number of resistance alleles is one of the main objectives of cocoa breeding for sustainable cocoa resistance. The large set of available SNP markers could facilitate the selection of resistant and high yielding cocoa trees via GS approaches enabling the use of all genome regions tagged by SNP markers, even those with very small effects.The search for candidate genes underlying trait variation is another major challenge for plant biologists, with the aim of gaining further insight into the mechanisms underlying trait variation, and producing tools to efficiently screen and exploit genetic resources.The consensus map produced in this work has been used efficiently for anchoring an assembly of T. cacao Criollo genome sequences, and for constituting pseudomolecules.1 Recently, two different cocoa varieties, i.e. Criollo1 and Forastero from the Lower Amazon region (http://www.cacaogenomedb.org/), were sequenced, with 28 798 and 35 000 annotated genes, respectively. These sequences will greatly facilitate the identification of candidate genes, allowing integration of both genetic and genomic (functional and structural) data. Overall, about 300 QTLs or marker/trait associations have already been identified in T. cacao. High-throughput genotyping associated with a high marker density will facilitate fine mapping of genes involved in trait variation (with GWAS or classical QTL analyses conducted on large progenies), thus allowing to refine the QTL position in the genome, while facilitating the search for candidate genes in corresponding genome sequences. Several functional studies have already been conducted in cocoa, focused mainly on genes generally expressed in specific physiological conditions or metabolisms.73 It will be now possible to focus more specifically on the expression of genes directly responsible for trait variation after candidate gene validation.Analysing genome evolution during domestication processes or adaptation to climate change can also help us to identify key genes underlying adaptive traits.74 Loss of diversity generally occurs during genome evolution, and some genes are selectively involved in natural selection or domestication. A large set of SNPs defined in expressed genes, such as those identified in this study, provides a key tool for identifying selection signatures or adaptive substitutions, and then highlighting candidate genes potentially involved in the adaptation60 or domestication processes and their corresponding molecular functions.75 All SNPs reported in this paper were identified in orthologous genes or gene families, thus facilitating comparative genomic approaches, and benefiting from gene knowledge accumulated in other species to accelerate cocoa breeding.5.

IntroductionLow temperature and dehydration affect plant growth and productivity, and many genes respond to both stressors at the transcriptional level, and their gene products function in stress tolerance and response.1–4 These genes include key metabolic enzymes, late embryogenesis-abundant (LEA) proteins, detoxification enzymes, chaperones, protein kinases and transcription factors.1–4 The cis-acting elements that function in stress-responsive gene expression have been analysed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms of gene expression in response to these stresses.5 The dehydration-responsive element (DRE), containing the core sequence A/GCCGAC, is a cis-acting element that regulates cold- and dehydration-responsive gene expression in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).6 A similar motif was identified as the C-repeat and low temperature-responsive promoter element.7,8 The abscisic acid (ABA) -responsive element (ABRE), containing the core sequence ACGTGG/T, is a cis-acting element that regulates dehydration- and high salinity-responsive gene expression in Arabidopsis and rice (Oryza sativa).5,9 ABA-responsive gene expression requires multiple ABREs or an ABRE with a coupling element as a functional promoter.10–15Arabidopsis cDNAs encoding the ethylene-responsive element-binding factor/APETALA2-type DRE-binding (DREB) proteins (CBF1, DREB1A, and DREB2A) have been isolated by one-hybrid screening in yeast,16,17 and they specifically bind to the DRE/C-repeat sequence to activate gene transcription in Arabidopsis. Arabidopsis has three DREB1/CBF proteins encoded by genes that lie in tandem on chromosome 4 in the order DREB1B/CBF1, DREB1A/CBF3, and DREB1C/CBF2.17,18 Arabidopsis also has DREB2A and DREB2B proteins.17 Although expression of all three DREB1/CBF genes is induced by cold but not by dehydration, both DREB2 genes are induced by dehydration and high salinity.17 Both DREB1/CBF and DREB2 proteins bind to DRE, but DREB1/CBFs function in cold-responsive gene expression, and DREB2s function in dehydration-responsive gene expression.CaMV 35S promoter-driven overexpression of DREB1/CBFs increases stress tolerance to freezing, dehydration, and high salinity in transgenic Arabidopsis.17,19,20 More than 100 downstream targets of DREB1A/CBF3 have been identified by microarray analysis.21–25 Overexpression of the constitutively active form of DREB2A (35S:DREB2A-CA) significantly increases dehydration tolerance but only slightly increases freezing tolerance.26 Microarray analyses of 35S:DREB2A-CA plants revealed that DREB2A regulates expression of many dehydration-responsive genes; however, some genes regulated by DREB1A are not regulated by DREB2A.26Promoter analysis of DREB1A- and DREB2A-regulated genes and gel mobility shift assays revealed that DREB1A has the highest affinity for A/GCCGACNT, and DREB2A preferentially binds ACCGAC,23,26 thus controlling the induction of different downstream genes. DREB2A expression also is regulated by heat-shock stress, and thermo-tolerance is significantly increased in 35S:DREB2A-CA plants.27 Heat shock-inducible proteins and transcription factors are upregulated in 35S:DREB2A-CA plants but not in 35S:DREB1A plants. DREB2A-regulated genes are involved in dehydration, high salinity, and heat-shock stress tolerance but not freezing stress.27 DREB1A and DREB2A downstream gene products mostly have similar functions, but they encode different enzymes for carbohydrate metabolism.25ABRE-binding (AREB) proteins or ABRE-binding factors (ABFs) have been isolated using ABRE sequences as baits in one-hybrid screens in yeast.28,29 AREB/ABFs encode basic-domain leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factors, and they comprise a family with nine members in Arabidopsis.28–35 Among the nine members, AREB1/ABF2, AREB2/ABF4, and ABF3 are induced by dehydration and high salinity in vegetative tissues,36 and their gain-of-function mutants show enhanced dehydration stress tolerance.36–38 The areb1 areb2 abf3 triple mutant displays enhanced ABA insensitivity and reduced dehydration stress tolerance compared with control plants, and these effects are accompanied by disruption of dehydration-responsive gene expression.39In this study, the promoter sequences in cold- and dehydration-inducible genes of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean (Glycine max) were analysed. Previously, we reported cold- and dehydration-responsive genes in Arabidopsis.25 In the current study, we used oligo microarrays to identify cold- and dehydration-responsive genes in rice and soybean. The observed frequencies of all (46 = 4096) hexamer sequences in cold- and dehydration-inducible promoters were compared with standardized promoters to estimate conserved sequences and to determine representative cold- and dehydration-responsive transcriptional pathways in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and growth conditionsWild-type rice plants (Oryza sativa L. cv. Nipponbare) were grown in plastic pots filled with nutrient soil for 2 weeks under flooded lowland conditions with a 12-h light (28°C)/12-h dark (25°C) regimen (50 ± 10 µmol photons/m2/s). The plants were then: (i) transferred from 28 to 10°C and grown for 1 day for the cold treatment; or (ii) grown for 3 days at 28°C without watering to a 15.6% (SD 1.1) (w/w) soil moisture content for the dehydration treatment. Wild-type soybean plants (Glycine max (L.) Merr. cv. Nourin No. 2) were grown in plastic pots filled with nutrient soil for 3 weeks under a 12-h light/12-h dark regimen (50 ± 10 µmol photons/m2/s) at 28°C. The plants were then: (i) transferred from 28 to 4°C and grown for 1 day for the cold treatment; or (ii) grown for 4 days at 28°C without watering to <10% (w/w) soil moisture content for the dehydration treatment.2.2. Microarray analysesA rice oligo microarray (RAP-DB) was used for transcriptome analysis (Agilent Technologies). We constructed a new oligonucleotide microarray for soybean transcriptome analysis capable of detecting 43 640 protein-coding genes using eArray software with soybean protein-coding genes.40 Oligo microarray construction was performed by Agilent Technologies Inc. The RNAs are labelled with a Low RNA Input Linear Amplification/Labeling Kit™ (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Aliquots of Cy5-labelled cRNA of the samples and Cy3-labelled cRNA of the control samples are used for hybridization in the microarray. Biological and technical (dye swap) replicate sample sets are analysed. After hybridization, microarray slides are scanned (scanner model G2505C with scan control software, version A.8.5.1; Agilent Technologies) and the data are analysed using Feature Extraction software, version 10.10.1.1 (Agilent Technologies). All microarray data analyses were performed according to the Agilent methodology. Raw data were analysed by GeneSpring GX software, version 11.5.1 (Agilent Technologies) and normalized using the Lowess normalization method. Expression log ratios and Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate P-values of the cross-gene error model were also calculated by GeneSpring GX. Microarray design and data were deposited at MIAMExpress (accession numbers E-MEXP-2294, E-MEXP-2295, E-MEXP-2725, E-MEXP-2726, and E-MEXP-3164).2.3. Measurement of ABA levelsThe ABA level in 100 mg of each plant was quantified as described41 using a liquid chromatography-mass chromatography system (UPLC/Quattro Premier XE; Waters) with an ODS column (AQUITY-UPLC BEH-C 18, 1.7 µm, 2.1 × 100 mm; Waters). Reproducibility was assessed using three biological replicates in each experiment.3. Results3.1. Identification of cold- and dehydration-responsive genes in rice and soybeanMicroarray analyses were used to identify cold- and dehydration-responsive genes in rice and soybean. The 389-Mb rice genome and the 1115-Mb soybean genome have been sequenced, and 37 544 and 46 430 protein-coding genes, respectively, have been predicted.40,42 A rice oligo microarray (RAP-DB) including 29 690 rice genes was used for transcriptome analysis (Agilent Technologies). In rice plants exposed to cold or dehydration, 4022 (cold) and 4632 (dehydration) genes were significantly upregulated [Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR): P < 0.05; fold change (FC): >2], and 4704 (cold) and 5189 (dehydration) genes were significantly down-regulated (FDR: P < 0.05; FC: <0.5) (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). Because a soybean oligo microarray was not available, we constructed a new oligo microarray for transcriptome analysis capable of detecting 43 640 protein-coding genes using eArray software with soybean protein-coding genes.40 In soybean plants exposed to cold or dehydration, 5993 (cold) and 4433 (dehydration) genes were significantly upregulated (FDR: P < 0.05; FC: >2), and 6350 (cold) and 5098 (dehydration) genes were significantly downregulated (FDR: P < 0.05; FC: < 0.5) (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4).3.2. Molecular function of cold- and dehydration-responsive genes in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybeanWe annotated cold- and dehydration-responsive genes in rice and soybean with Gene Ontology (GO) data, and we re-annotated these genes in Arabidopsis. First, all amino acid sequence data were downloaded from TAIR10,43 RAP-DB,44 and Phytozome (http://www.phytozome.net/), and motifs were searched using the HMMER program.45 Pfam entries were then converted to GO terms according to the methods of Hunter et al.46 Secondly, data for Enzyme Commission (EC) numbers were downloaded from KEGG,47 AraCyc,48 Plantcyc,49 and Kappa-view50 and then converted to GO terms.51 Thirdly, we downloaded data for GO terms from TAIR10, RAP-DB, Phytozome, AgriGO,52 GRAMENE,53 and AmiGO.54 Based on the GO data, 3717 molecular functions were categorized into 27 classes according to the KEGG PATHWAY. Among the genes detected by the oligo microarrays, 10 005 (Arabidopsis), 11 271 (rice), and 17 416 (soybean) genes were annotated in the databases (Supplementary Tables S5–S9), and our Arabidopsis transcription profile was similar to that of rice and soybean. For each species, dehydrin/LEA- and photosynthesis-related genes were representative of up- and downregulated classes, respectively, whereas helicase genes were representative of a cold-induced upregulated class (Fig. 1).

Base composition in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean promotersTo identify conserved sequences in cold- and dehydration-inducible promoters, we collected sequence data for 10 000 promoters of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean genes. As we previously reported 10 000 promoter sequences of Arabidopsis genes,23 we used these data and also collected promoter sequences of rice and soybean genes. Sequences of 10 000 independent promoters from -1 to -1000 were randomly selected from genomic sequences of rice and soybean genes that have data for the full-length cDNA sequences to obtain the mean value of base compositions. We estimated positions of transcriptional start sites using sequences of more than 10 000 independent full-length cDNA clones for each species, which were previously compiled into databases.55,56To understand aspects of the promoter sequences of each species, we estimated base composition of the promoter sequences. Previously, we analysed base composition in Arabidopsis promoters.23 In this study, we analysed base composition in rice and soybean promoters, and we re-analysed that in Arabidopsis promoters. To estimate the sample mean of base composition in 10 000 promoters of three species, single random sampling (n = 100) was conducted for 1000 replicates, based on the central limit theorem. Base compositions of rice and soybean promoters were compared with Arabidopsis promoters. Promoter base compositions were AT-rich in Arabidopsis (A:C:G:T = 33.7:17.0:16.5:32.8), rice (A:C:G:T = 29.2:22.0:20.4:28.3), and soybean (A:C:G:T = 37.2:14.1:13.2:35.5) (Fig. 2A–C). In addition, the Smirnov–Grubbs test (P < 0.05) was used to detect outliers in promoter regions. In each species, high-frequency AT regions were found ~30 bases upstream of the transcriptional start sites, with high-frequency C regions from -1 and -100, except in AT-enriched regions (Fig. 2D–F; Supplementary Tables S10–S12). Base composition in promoters of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean.

Adenine (A, green), thymine (T, red), guanine (G, yellow), and cytosine (C, blue) base composition in promoter regions from -1 to -1000 (A–C) or from -1 to -100 (D–F).3.4. Frequency of promoter hexamer sequences in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybeanSeveral core sequences of cis-acting elements are hexamer sequences,6,7,9,57 including the core sequences of DRE (A/GCCGAC), ABRE (ACGTGG/T), and G box (CACGTG). To estimate biases in the frequency of promoter hexamer sequences, the number of all (46 = 4096) hexamer sequences was determined for 10 000 independent promoters (-1 to -1,000) of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean. Single random sampling (n = 100) of 1000 replicates was used to determine standardized promoters. We calculated sample means of frequencies of each hexamer sequence in the standardized promoters, and considered those sample means as observed frequencies in the standardized promoters (Supplementary Tables S13–S15). The most-frequent and second most-frequent hexamers were AAAAAA and TTTTTT, respectively, in standardized promoters of each species. The 10 most-frequent hexamers in standardized promoters of Arabidopsis were similar to those in standardized promoters of rice and soybean, with only W (Weak 2H bonds) residues (Supplementary Tables S13–S15). The 10 least-frequent hexamers in standardized promoters of Arabidopsis and soybean were not similar to those in standardized promoters of rice, and they had only S (Strong 3H bond) residues. The promoter hexamer sequences with the lowest frequency were GGGCGC (Arabidopsis), CGCCCG (soybean), and GCGTTA plus other sequences with W residues (rice) (Supplementary Tables S13–S15).To estimate over-represented hexamer sequences, first, expected frequencies were calculated using the base compositions of promoter sequences in each species (Supplementary Tables S16–S18). Then, the observed and expected frequencies of all hexamer sequences were compared (Z-test: P < 0.05). In Arabidopsis, GGCCCA had the highest (5.5) and TGGGCC had the second highest (5.4) fold-change between observed and expected frequencies (Supplementary Table S19). These were representative over-represented promoter hexamer sequences named site IIa, which act as cis-acting elements for basic helix-loop-helix or TCP-family transcription factors.58,59 Additionally, several repeat sequences (TCTCTC, CTCTCT, AAAAAA, TTTTTT, GAGAGA, and AGAGAG) were over-represented in Arabidopsis promoters (Supplementary Table S19). Rice and soybean promoters were similar to those of Arabidopsis, but they also had hexamer sequences with S residues (GGGGGG, CCCCCC, GGGCCC, GCGGCG, GGCGGC, and CGCCGC) (Supplementary Tables S20 and S21).3.5. Distribution of promoter hexamer sequences in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybeanTo estimate distribution biases of promoter hexamer sequences, all hexamer sequences were localized in 10 000 independent promoters (from -1 to -1000) in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean. The number of hexamer sequences was calculated and standardized for every 50 bases within promoters, and two major peaks (from -1 to -50 and from -51 to -100) were found. Distribution patterns of representative hexamer sequences are illustrated by heat maps (Fig. 3A–I). Heat maps of representative sequences in promoters of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean genes. The number of hexamer sequences was calculated and standardized for every 50 promoter bases to show high (red) and low (blue) frequencies (Z-scores) in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean. All (26 = 64) W (A–C) or Y (D–F) residue sequences in promoters are shown. Arrows in (A)–(F) indicate the 10 most-frequent hexamers identified (TTCTTC, TCTTCT, CTTCTT, TCTCTT, TTCTCT, TATAAA, ATATAA, TTTCTT, TATATA, TCTCTC). Several cis-acting element sequences like DRE (ACCGAC), ABRE (ACGTGG, ACGTGT, ACGTGG, CCACGT, CGTGGC, GCCACG), G box (CACGTG), CE3 (AACGCG, CACGCG), RE1 (GCCCAT), and site IIa (AGCCCA, GGCCCA, TGGGCC) were over-represented between -51 and -100 and are also marked by arrows (G–I).Heat maps of representative sequences in promoters of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean genes.

Arrows in (A)–(F) indicate the 10 most-frequent hexamers identified (TTCTTC, TCTTCT, CTTCTT, TCTCTT, TTCTCT, TATAAA, ATATAA, TTTCTT, TATATA, TCTCTC). Several cis-acting element sequences like DRE (ACCGAC), ABRE (ACGTGG, ACGTGT, ACGTGG, CCACGT, CGTGGC, GCCACG), G box (CACGTG), CE3 (AACGCG, CACGCG), RE1 (GCCCAT), and site IIa (AGCCCA, GGCCCA, TGGGCC) were over-represented between -51 and -100 and are also marked by arrows (G–I).The over-represented hexamer sequences (from -1 to -50) in Arabidopsis were similar to those in rice and soybean (Supplementary Tables S22–S24). The 10 most-frequent hexamers (Fig. 3A and B; TCTTCT, TATATA, TTCTTC, TCTCTC, CTCTCT, CTTCTT, TATAAA, TCTCTT, TTCTCT, and TTTCTT) in Arabidopsis were classified into two groups, one consisting of W residues (WR) and the other consisting of pyrimidine residues (YR). The frequencies of all possible (26 = 64) WR (Fig. 3A–C) and YR (Fig. 3D–F) hexamers in each species were determined and are presented as heat maps. Among the 64 WR in each species between -1 and -50, TATAAA and TATATA were over-represented while the others were under-represented in all species. The peak position of the TATATA sequence in promoters was at -33 (Arabidopsis), -32 (rice), and -31 (soybean) (Supplementary Fig. S1). Most YRs in each species were over-represented between -1 and -50, with peak positions near TATAAA and TATATA sequences. Similar YR hexamers have been reported to be over-represented as plant-specific sequences in Arabidopsis and rice promoters.60 In each species, the over-represented hexamer sequences between -51 and -100 included several cis-acting elements (Fig. 3G–I; Supplementary Tables S25–S27), such as DRE (ACCGAC), ABRE (ACGTGG, ACGTGT, ACGTGG, CCACGT, CGTGGC, and GCCACG), G box (CACGTG), CE3 (AACGCG and CACGCG), RE1 (GCCCAT), and site IIa (AGCCCA, GGCCCA, and TGGGCC). In contrast, these sequences were under-represented between -501 and -1000. We also found several novel over-represented sequences in promoters from -51 to -100 (Fig. 3G–I; Supplementary Tables S25–S27), which were not present in the plant cis-acting regulatory DNA elements (PLACE) database.613.6. Conserved promoter sequences of downstream genes of DREB1A, DREB2A, and AREB familyWe previously reported downstream genes of the transcription factors DREB1A and DREB2A using an oligo microarray.23 In 35S:DREB1A and 35S:DREB2A-CA plants, 259 and 373 genes were significantly upregulated, respectively (FDR: P < 0.05; FC: >2). In our present study, we selected the 100 most highly upregulated downstream genes with promoter information and counted all promoter hexamer sequences. To determine conserved promoter sequences, the observed frequencies of all promoter hexamer sequences of downstream genes of DREB1A or DREB2A were compared with standardized promoters (Z-test: P < 0.05). The Z-scores of all hexamer sequences are illustrated by scatter plots (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Table S28). In promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A, the ACCGAC sequence had the highest Z-score (a core sequence of DRE was the most conserved), with 3.8-fold more ACCGAC sequences than in standardized promoters. DRE also had the sequence with the second highest Z-score (TGTCGG), and other parts of DRE sequences (GTCGGC and GCCGAC) were found in promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A. The third highest Z-score (ACGTGG) was part of ABRE, with 2.4-fold more ACGTGG sequences than in standardized promoters (Fig. 4A; Supplementary Table S28). These results confirmed our previous findings showing that DRE and ABRE are conserved in promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A.23 In addition, we found that a portion of Evening element (EE: ATATCT) was also highly conserved in promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A ((Fig. 4A; Supplementary Table S28). In promoters of downstream genes of DREB2A, DRE had the most conserved sequence (ACCGAC), with 3.9-fold more ACCGAC sequences than in standardized promoters. The second (CCGACT) and third (GTCGGT) highest Z-scores were also part of DRE (Fig. 4B; Supplementary Table S29). These results also confirmed our earlier finding that DRE is highly conserved in promoters of downstream genes of DREB2A.26Scatter plots showing Z-scores (y axes) for the observed frequencies of all hexamer sequences (x axes) in promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A (A), DREB2A (B), and the AREB family (C) compared with standardized promoters. The highly conserved sequences DRE (blue), ABRE (red), EE (green), and G box (purple) are shown.Scatter plots showing Z-scores (y axes) for the observed frequencies of all hexamer sequences (x axes) in promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A (A), DREB2A (B), and the AREB family (C) compared with standardized promoters. The highly conserved sequences DRE (blue), ABRE (red), EE (green), and G box (purple) are shown.AREB1, AREB2, and ABF3 are members of the AREB family, which is a subgroup of the bZIP-type transcription factors, and they are key transcription factors under conditions of dehydration. Many downstream genes of the AREB family are expressed under dehydration stress in the areb1 areb2 abf3 triple mutant.39 In promoters of downstream genes of the AREB family, the most conserved sequence (CGTGTC in the ABRE motif) was 5.4-fold more abundant than in standardized promoters. ABRE also had the sequence with the second highest Z-score (ACACGT), and other parts of ABRE and G box were highly conserved in promoters of downstream genes of the AREB family (Fig. 4C; Supplementary Table S30). Hence, our comprehensive promoter analyses could detect conserved sequences in a select promoter set.3.7. Conserved sequences in cold- and dehydration-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybeanIn cold-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis, the most conserved sequence (ACCGAC in DRE) was 3.6-fold more abundant than in standardized promoters (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Table S31). The second most conserved sequence (AATATC) was part of EE (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Table S31). Several hexamers in DRE (CCGACA and GTCGGT), EE (ATATCT and GATATT), and ABRE (ACGTGG) sequences also were highly conserved in cold-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis (Fig. 5A; Supplementary Table S31). In dehydration-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis, the most conserved sequence (ACACGT), second most conserved sequence (ACGTGT), and other highly conserved sequences were part of ABRE and G box (CACGTG) (Fig. 5B; Supplementary Table S32).

The highly conserved sequences of DRE (blue), ABRE (red), EE (green), G box (purple), T/G box (light blue), CE3 (light green), and novel sequences (black) are shown.In cold-inducible promoters of rice, the most (CGTACG) and second most (GTAGTA) conserved sequences were 2.8- and 2.1-fold, respectively, more abundant than in standardized promoters (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Table S33). These sequences were not registered with PLACE.61 Other highly conserved sequences in cold-inducible rice promoters were part of ABRE (ACGTAC and GTACGT) (Fig. 5C; Supplementary Table S33). The dehydration-inducible rice promoters had the most (ACACGT in ABRE) and second most (CACGCG in CE3) conserved sequences, as well as other highly conserved ABRE (CGCCAC), CE3 (ACGCGT and CGCGTC), and novel (CCGATC, CGATCG, and GCACGC) sequences (Fig. 5D; Supplementary Table S34).The cold-inducible soybean promoters had the most (ACACGT in ABRE; 2.6-fold more abundant than in standardized promoters) and second most (ACGCGT in CE3) conserved sequences, as well as other highly conserved sequences (ACGTGG in ABRE; CGCGTT in CE3; ATGTCG in DRE; and CACGTT, CCGTGT and AACACG sequences) (Fig. 5E; Supplementary Table S35). CACGTT is part of pABRE3, T/G box, QAR, WAR, and OsBP-5 binding site, all of which have been identified as cis-acting elements that regulate gene expression in response to ABA62 or jasmonates.63–65 The dehydration-inducible soybean promoters had the most (ACGTGG in ABRE; 3.5-fold more abundant than in standardized promoters) and second most (CACGTG in G box) conserved sequences, and there were other highly conserved parts of ABRE (Fig. 5F; Supplementary Table S36).3.8. Six most-frequent core motifs known as cis-acting elements in cold- and dehydration-inducible promoters in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybeanWe found that several cis-acting elements were conserved in promoters of cold- and dehydration-inducible genes using our comprehensive promoter analysis. Then, we focused on the six most-frequent cis-acting elements (DRE, ABRE, EE, G box, CE3, and T/G box) in cold- or dehydration-inducible promoters and illustrated the Z-score of each cis-acting element using heat maps.In cold-inducible Arabidopsis promoters, DRE and EE were highly conserved motifs, and ABRE, G box, and T/G box also were conserved; in contrast, in dehydration-inducible Arabidopsis promoters, ABRE and G box were highly conserved motifs, and DRE, EE, CE3, and T/G box also were conserved. The DRE and EE motifs occurred more frequently in cold-inducible promoters, whereas the ABRE and G box motifs occurred more frequently in the dehydration-inducible promoters (Fig. 6). In cold-inducible soybean promoters, ABRE and T/G box were highly conserved, and DRE, G box, and CE3 also were conserved. The observed frequencies of six representative motifs in dehydration-inducible soybean promoters were similar to those in dehydration-inducible Arabidopsis promoters. In dehydration-inducible soybean promoters, ABRE and G box were highly conserved, and DRE and T/G box also were conserved. ABRE and G box occurred more frequently in dehydration-inducible soybean promoters (Fig. 6). In our promoter analyses, there were no extremely highly conserved motifs in rice promoters similar to DRE or ABRE in cold- or dehydration-inducible Arabidopsis promoters. In cold-inducible rice promoters, ABRE, EE, and CE3 were conserved. In dehydration-inducible rice promoters, CE3 was a highly conserved motif, and DRE, ABRE, and G box were conserved. EE motifs were more frequent in cold-inducible rice promoters, and ABRE, G box, and CE3 motifs occurred more frequent in dehydration-inducible rice promoters (Fig. 6).

Each small square indicates the conserved level of the cis-acting elements. Solid gray and white squares show conserved and non-conserved cis-acting elements, respectively (Z-test: P < 0.05).The observed frequencies of the six cis-acting elements in promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A were similar to those of cold-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis. In promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A, DRE and EE were highly conserved motifs, and ABRE and G box also were conserved. In contrast, the observed frequencies of the six cis-acting motifs in promoters of downstream genes of DREB2A were not similar to those of cold- or dehydration-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis. Only DRE was highly conserved in promoters of downstream genes of DREB2A. In promoters of downstream genes of the AREB family, ABRE and G box were highly conserved motifs, and DRE and CE3 were conserved (Fig. 6). The frequencies of the six cis-acting elements in promoters of downstream genes of the AREB family were similar to those of dehydration-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis.3.9. Quantification of ABA in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean exposed to cold or dehydrationWe found that ABRE was highly conserved in cold- and dehydration-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean. To clarify relationship between these ABRE sequences and ABA effects on the dehydration- and cold-inducible genes, we measured ABA levels in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean plants exposed to cold or dehydration. ABA levels in cold-treated Arabidopsis and rice plants were 1.8- and 3.8-fold higher, respectively, than in untreated controls. In contrast, the level of ABA in soybean plants decreased under cold conditions and was 3.7-fold lower than in untreated controls. Under dehydration conditions, ABA levels increased 21.2-, 34.6-, and 5.1-fold in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean, respectively, when compared with untreated controls (Supplementary Fig. S2).4. DiscussionIn this study, transcriptome and comprehensive promoter sequence analyses demonstrated general characteristics of promoter sequences in cold- or dehydration-inducible genes of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean. Rice and soybean transcription profiles were similar to those of Arabidopsis, showing representative upregulated (dehydrin and LEA genes) and downregulated (photosynthesis-related genes) classes after exposure to cold or dehydration. In contrast, the profiles for cold- or dehydration-inducible promoter sequences displayed various characteristics in each species.In our promoter analyses, DRE was a highly conserved motif in cold-inducible Arabidopsis promoters and in promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A. Indeed, 56% of cold-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis contain single or multiple DRE core sequences (25.6% standardized promoters of Arabidopsis contain single or multiple DRE core sequences). In addition, the observed frequencies of the six most-frequent cis-acting elements in cold-inducible Arabidopsis promoters were similar to those in promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A (Figs 4A, 5A, and 6). CaMV 35S promoter-driven overexpression of DREB1A increases freezing stress tolerance in transgenic Arabidopsis.17,19,20 Microarray analyses identified >100 downstream targets of DREB1A/CBF3, and gel mobility shift assays revealed that DREB1A has the highest affinity for the DRE core sequence.21–25 These results suggest that the DRE/DREB1A-dependent transcriptional regulatory pathway plays an important role in cold-inducible gene expression in Arabidopsis.In dehydration-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis and in promoters of downstream genes of DREB2A, DRE also was conserved, revealing that 41% of dehydration-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis contain single or multiple DRE core sequences. In Arabidopsis, overexpression of the constitutively active form of DREB2A (35S:DREB2A-CA) significantly increases dehydration tolerance, and microarray analyses revealed that DREB2A regulates the expression of many dehydration-responsive genes26,27 by preferentially binding ACCGAC.27 However, the observed frequencies of six representative cis-acting elements in dehydration-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis were not similar to those in promoters of downstream genes of DREB2A. These results suggest that DRE/DREB2A-dependent transcriptional regulation has a particular role in the expression of dehydration-inducible genes in Arabidopsis. DRE also was a conserved motif in dehydration-inducible soybean and rice promoters; 22% (soybean) and 49% (rice) of dehydration-inducible promoters contain single or multiple DRE core sequences compared with 12.7 (soybean) and 40.3% (rice) for standardized promoters. Orthologous DREB2A genes in soybean (Glyma06g03110, Glyma17g37350, Glyma14g06080) and rice (Os01g0165000, Os05g0346200) were significantly upregulated in plants exposed to dehydration (Supplementary Tables S2 and S4). These results suggest that DRE-dependent gene expression also occurs in both soybean and rice in response to dehydration.ABRE was a highly conserved motif in dehydration-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis, soybean, and rice (Figs 5B, D, F and 6) and in promoters of downstream genes of the AREB family (Figs 4C and 6). Notably, 82 (Arabidopsis), 70 (soybean), and 71% (rice) of dehydration-inducible promoters contain single or multiple ABRE core sequences compared with 44.8 (Arabidopsis), 39.5 (soybean), and 53.5% (rice) for standardized promoters. The ABRE motif is a cis-acting element for the AREB family transcription factors, including Arabidopsis AREB/ABFs and ABI5 and rice TRAB1 proteins, which can bind to ABRE and activate dehydration-inducible gene expression.28–35,66 The areb1 areb2 abf3 triple mutant has impaired dehydration-inducible gene expression and reduced dehydration stress tolerance.39 The AREB/ABF genes were reported to be induced by dehydration in Arabidopsis plants,36 and our microarray analyses revealed that AREB/ABF orthologs in soybean (Glyma19g37910, Glyma03g00580, Glyma04g04170, Glyma13g03880, Glyma10g08370) and rice (Os02g0766700: OsAREB1, Os01g0859300: OsAREB3, Os06g0211200: OsAREB8, Os08g0472000: TRAB1) were significantly upregulated in response to dehydration (Supplementary Tables S2 and S4). Hence, ABRE/AREB family-dependent gene expression likely plays a major role in dehydration-inducible gene expression in Arabidopsis, soybean, and rice.In our study, ABRE was also conserved in cold-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean (Figs 5A, C, E), and 62 (Arabidopsis), 63 (soybean), and 67% (rice) of cold-inducible promoters contain single or multiple ABRE core sequences. Expression levels of several AREB/ABFs and their orthologous genes, including Arabidopsis At1g49720: ABF1 and At4g34000: ABI3 and rice Os02g0766700: OsAREB1 and Os07g0686100: OsAREB7, were slightly increased in response to cold (Supplementary Tables S1 and S3). The ABRE functions as a cis-acting element that regulates ABA-responsive gene expression.5,9 We showed that ABA levels increased significantly in all three species in response to dehydration, but they decreased (soybean) or slightly increased (Arabidopsis and rice) in response to cold (Supplementary Fig. S2). These results suggest that cold-inducible ABRE-dependent gene expression occurs in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean, but most of this expression is independent of ABA in the three species, especially soybean.EE was a highly conserved motif in cold-inducible Arabidopsis promoters and had a higher observed frequency in cold-inducible than in dehydration-inducible promoters in all three species (Fig. 6). In Arabidopsis, EE has a cis-acting element for CCA1 and LHY transcription factors, which are related to circadian clock-regulated genes that control cold-inducible gene expression.67–70 Orthologous rice genes for CCA1 and LHY have similar expression patterns as in Arabidopsis.71 Hence, EE-dependent transcription likely regulates cold-inducible gene expression more than dehydration-inducible gene expression in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean. We identified novel highly conserved CGTACG and GTAGTA sequences in cold-inducible rice promoters that were not highly conserved in cold- or dehydration-inducible promoters in Arabidopsis or soybean (Fig. 5). These sequences have never been reported as cis-acting elements for cold- or dehydration-inducible gene expression, and thus they are novel candidates for cis-acting elements involved in cold-inducible gene expression in rice.Several cold- or dehydration-inducible promoters contained one or more cis-acting elements. DRE and ABRE have an interdependent relationship in the rd29 promoter.14 We analysed the colocalization of six kinds of cis-acting elements in cold- or dehydration-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean (Fig. 6). In cold-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis, the most and the second most colocalized motifs were DRE + EE and DRE + ABRE, respectively. In addition, promoters of downstream genes of DREB1A had similar colocalized motifs to cold-inducible promoters of Arabidopsis (Figs 4A and 6). Several downstream genes of DREB1A also are induced by dehydration or regulating by the circadian clock.23 In cold-inducible gene expression in Arabidopsis, parts of the DRE-dependent transcriptional regulatory pathway overlapped with the ABRE-dependent and EE-dependent pathways. Multiple ABRE motifs are necessary for the expression of ABA-inducible genes in seeds and vegetative tissues. Either an additional copy of ABRE or coupling elements is necessary for ABA-inducible gene expression.10–15 Most of the known coupling elements are similar to ABREs and contain an ACGT motif. The representative coupling element, CE3, was identified using the promoters of barley or rice ABA-inducible genes.12,13 In our analyses of dehydration-inducible promoters in Arabidopsis and soybean, the ABRE motif was highly co-localized with its likely coupling elements ABRE, DRE, G box, or EE (Fig. 6). In dehydration-inducible promoters in rice, the ABRE motif was highly co-localized with CE3 (Fig. 6), suggesting that the ABRE coupling elements in monocots differ from those in dicots.Based on our comprehensive promoter sequence analyses, we can estimate the evolution of dehydration- or cold-responsive transcriptional pathways. The dehydration-inducible promoter sequence profiles displayed similar characteristics in Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean. ABRE is the most conserved sequence in dehydration-inducible promoters of all three species (Figs 5B, D, F and 6). In response to dehydration, ABA levels increased in all three species (Supplementary Fig. S2). It has been reported that most dehydration-inducible genes are also induced by ABA,3,72 and ABA is thought to be involved in dehydration-inducible gene expression in all land plants.3,72,73 These results suggest that the ABA-responsive ABRE-dependent transcriptional pathway is fundamental to dehydration-responsive gene expression in land plants, including Arabidopsis, rice, and soybean, and that it arose during land colonization of plants before the divergence of monocots and dicots. In contrast, the cold-inducible promoter sequence profiles displayed different characteristics among the three species we studied (Figs 5 and 6), suggesting that cold-responsive transcriptional pathways diversified after land colonization of plants.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported partly by grants from the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries of Japan (in part by Genomics for Agricultural Innovation, Development of Abiotic Stress Tolerant Crops by DREB Genes), the Program for Promotion of Basic and Applied Research for Innovations in Bio-oriented Industry (BRAIN), Science and Technology Research Partnership for Sustainable Development (SATREPS) of Japan Science and Technology Agency/Japan International Cooperation Agency, and the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.We are grateful to E.

IntroductionThe Brassiceae tribe consists some of the world's most important oilseed and vegetable crops, such as Brassica napus L., (rapeseed, genomes = AACC, 2n = 4x = 38), Brassica rapa L. (Indian mustard, genome = AA, 2n = 2x = 20), Brassica juncea L. (genomes = AABB, 2n = 4x = 36), and Brassica oleracea L. (cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprout, cabbage, and kale, genome = CC, 2n = 2x = 18). Brassica napus originated as a result from spontaneous hybridization between B. rapa and B. oleracea1 and is believed to be originated in the Mediterranean region of south-western Europe where native B. rapa and B. oleracea overlap,2 although no wild populations exist. Today, rapeseed is one of the leading sources of vegetable oil, oil-meal, fodder, and serves as the raw material for a broad range of industrial products including bio-fuel, especially in European countries.Various molecular marker system based upon restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP), randomly amplified polymorphic DNA, amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP®), simple sequence repeats (SSRs), sequence related amplified polymorphisms, and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) have been developed3–7 and further applied in rapeseed genetics and breeding research.2,8–15 Most of these markers are assayed on low-throughput agarose or polyacrylamide gel system, although markers based upon SSR and AFLP can be assayed on highly parallel genotyping platforms such as capillary electrophoresis systems, yet they are expensive to assay per data point.16Rapeseed breeding programmes require an efficient, cost-efficient and reproducible marker platform that is amenable for whole genomic analysis especially for pedigree and association analysis,17,18 mapping-as-you-go,19 large-scale molecular evaluation of germplasm collections and for genome-wide selection of desirable alleles.20 Current polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based marker technologies are not practicable in terms of consumable and labour costs for such applications.DNA hybridization-based technologies such as some SNP technologies and Diversity Arrays Technology (DArT) are suitable for such applications. SNP markers are recognized as ‘markers of choice’ due to their abundance and distribution in the genomes and the ability to screen populations at relatively low cost.21 In the recent years, a large number of SNP markers has been identified in B. napus and related species.22,23 However, the identification of SNPs and validation in the relevant germplasm especially those identified by sequencing candidate genes remains costly to implement for the routine marker-assisted selection, as it requires high-quality sequence information. This limits the broad application of SNP markers for rapeseed improvement using these strategies. Many genes of agronomic importance such as flowering time genes; Flowering Locus C (FLC) and Flowering Locus T (FT) occur in multiple copies in Brassica genomes.24,25 The presence of multiple copies of genes in amphidiploid rapeseed poses a great challenge to develop allele-specific SNP markers. To date, only a few genome-specific SNP markers are currently available for marker-assisted selection although the ability to resolve allelic variation in members of gene families has been demonstrated.26,27 In addition, a large number of SSR and SNP markers have been developed in private consortia and are not readily accessible to the rapeseed breeding programmes. The development of ‘genotyping by sequencing’ and multiplex sequencing strategies using next generation DNA-sequencing technologies offer to generate massive amount of genetic data for various applications.28,29 However, these technologies are currently in the development stage and bioinformatics tools to handle such massive data in polyploid Brassica species are still being developed.30 These limitations currently restrict the capacity of breeding programmes to routinely conduct genome-wide marker surveys.DArT performs well in many polyploid species and does not require any DNA-sequence information. DArT marker analysis is a sequence-independent microarray-based genotyping platform, and enables high multiplexing; simultaneous typing of several hundred to several thousands of polymorphic loci spread over the genome.31,32 DArT polymorphisms results from nucleotide polymorphisms within restriction enzyme (RE) recognition sites and indels, and the high fidelity of the RE can provide better reproducibility compared with PCR-based assays that are based on lower fidelity selective primer annealing. DArT markers have been developed in more than 40 plant species including in wheat, durum, barley, oats, lupin (www.diversityarray.com) and have been employed extensively for construction of molecular maps,33–36 identifying trait-marker associations,37–40 assessment of genetic diversity,34,41,42 association mapping,43 and routine genotyping in various crops for varietal identification.In this study, we report on (i) the development of a robust, cost-effective, and high-throughput DArT marker platform for rapeseed, and (ii) demonstrate the usefulness of DArT markers in the assessment of genetic diversity and linkage mapping.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialEighty-nine accessions of B. napus, B. juncea, B. rapa and B. carinata comprising contemporary rapeseed cultivars and elite lines from Australian breeding programmes were chosen for molecular diversity analyses along with accessions from China, Germany, Japan, India, France, and Ethiopia (Table 1). Seed samples were procured from the Australian National Brassica Germplasm Improvement Programs (Wagga Wagga and Horsham) and Australian Temperate Field Crops Collection, Horsham.

Sass (Norddeutsche Pflanzenzucht Hans-Georg Lembke KG, Hohenlieth, Germany). Monty is an Australian spring variety with typical canola quality seed oil characteristics;46 Monty-028DH seed was provided by Canola Breeders Western Australia Pty Ltd (Perth, Australia). The DH parental lines Lynx-037DH and Monty-028DH were crossed reciprocally to produce F1 seeds. A single F1 plant from each reciprocal cross was used as microspore donor for microspore culture using the same methods as used for the parental DH lines production. Self-seed of the primary DH progeny were multiplied either during the summer of 2004–05 at Manjimup Horticultural Research Centre (Manjimup, Australia) or during the winter of 2005 at The University of Western Australia's Shenton Park field station (Perth, Australia).2.2. DNA isolationDNA was obtained from 131 ‘BnaLMDH’ lines along with parental and F1 controls using a standard CTAB method44 or using Illustra Nucleon Phytopure Genomic DNA Extraction Kits (GE Healthcare).2.3. Development of B. napus DArT arrayInitially, the most frequently used seven methods of complexity reduction (all based on a combination of PstI RE and a single ‘frequently cutting’ RE) were tested in several Brassica accessions by resolving products of representation amplification on 1.2% agarose gel. After this initial test, two methods with the most heterodispersed (no observable banding) smears of PCR products were selected: PstI/BstNI and PstI/BanII (data not reported). The DArT markers were designated with the prefix ‘BrPb’ where ‘Br’ indicates for Brassica, ‘P’ for PstI (primary enzyme used) and ‘b’ for BanII (secondary RE used) followed by a number corresponding to their unique clone ID.2.4. Preparation of genomic representationsThe PstI/BstNI genomic representations were prepared as described before for barley,32 while PstI/BanII representations were prepared similarly as for sorghum according to a previous report.36 Briefly, ~50 ng of genomic DNA was digested with either PstI and BstNI or PstI and BanII RE combinations and resulting fragments ligated to a PstI overhang compatible oligonucleotide adapter. A primer annealing to this adapter was used in PCR reaction to amplify complexity reduced representation of a sample. Amplification products were either used for cloning in marker development process or labelled with fluorescent dyes and hybridized to DArT array in genotyping process.2.5. Library construction and array printingFor library construction, we used 107 Brassica genotypes (Supplementary Table S1). Amplified PstI restriction fragments from all accessions were cloned into pCR2.1-TOPO vector (Invitrogen, Australia) and 10 libraries were generated (Supplementary Table S2) as described by Jaccoud et al.31 The white colonies containing genomic fragments inserted into pCR2.1-TOPO vector were picked into individual wells of 384-well microtitre plates filled with ampicillin/kanamycin-supplemented freezing medium. There were 7680 clones in PstI/BstNI and 3840 clones in PstI/BanII libraries (a total of 11 520 clones). Inserts from these clones were amplified using M13F and M13R primers in 384 plate format, a subset of PCR products were assessed for quality (10% of 25 µl PCR reaction) through gel electrophoresis and all remaining PCR products dried, washed and dissolved in a spotting buffer as described previously.47 Microarrays were printed with spot duplication on SuperChip poly-l-lysine slides (Thermo Scientific, Australia) using a MicroGrid arrayer (Genomics Solutions, UK).2.6. DArT genotypingEach sample was assayed using methods described above for library construction. Genomic representations were assessed for quality through gel electrophoresis in 1.3% agarose and labelled with fluorescent dyes (Cy3 and Cy5) as described previously.32 Labelled targets were than hybridized to printed DArT arrays for 16 h at 62°C in a water bath. Slides were washed as described by Kilian et al.,47 dried initially by centrifugation at 500 × g for 7 min and later in a desiccator under vacuum for 30 min. The slides were scanned using Tecan LS300 scanner generating three images per array: one image scanned at 488 nm for reference signal measures the amount of DNA within the spot based on hybridization signal of FAM-labelled fragment of a TOPO vector multiple cloning site fragment and two images for ‘target’ signal measurement: one scanned at 543 nM (for Cy3-labelled targets) and one at 633 nm (for Cy-5-labelled targets).2.7. Array image processing and polymorphism scoringAll the images were analysed with the DArTsoft v. 7.4.7 (DArT P/L, Canberra, Australia) software. The same software was used to score polymorphic markers in a binary manner (for the presence of marker in the representation as ‘1’ and for the absence as ‘0’) as described previously.32 For quality control, 30% of genotypes were genotyped in full technical replication. Clones with P > 77%, a call rate >97%, and 100% allele-calling consistency across the replicates were selected as markers. P-value represents the allelic-states variance of the relative target hybridization intensity as a percentage of the total variance.34 The informativeness of the DArT markers was determined by calculating the polymorphism information content (PIC), within the panel of diverse accessions (Table 1) according to Anderson et al.482.8. Genetic diversity analysisPair-wise genetic similarity matrix was calculated from binary DArT matrices using the Jaccard's coefficient (J) where J = a/(n – d) and ‘a’ is the number of fragments in common, ‘d’ is the number of fragments absent, and ‘n’ is the total number of DArT loci scored.49 Similarities matrices were converted to genetic distances according to Swofford and Olson.50 The dendrogram was generated based on Jaccard's coefficient with Unweighted Pair-Group Method using Arithmetic average (UPGMA) method in Sequential, Agglomerative, Hierarchical and Nested Clustering module51 of Numerical Taxonomy and Multivariate Analysis System for personal computers software (NTSYS-pc), version 2.21.52 The marker data were processed using the SIMINT module in NTSYS to compute a correlation among the columns for the 1000 bootstrap samples. The dendrogram was visualized using the program TREEVIEW implemented in NTSYSpc. The MXCOMP subroutine was used to calculate a cophenetic correlation matrix between the genetic similarity matrix and the tree matrix to measure goodness-of-fit implemented in the NTSYSpc package. Multivariate principle component analysis (PCA) based on genetic similarity matrices were used to resolve the genetic relationship and overall diversity among different accessions.2.9. Linkage map constructionThe ‘BnaLMDH’ mapping population of 131 DH lines along with parental and F1 controls were genotyped with the initial marker discovery DArT array (Version 1.0). Highly polymorphic DArT clones in the set of diverse rapeseed germplasm (Supplementary Table S1) were selected and arrayed for routine DArT analysis (Version 2.0). A subset of 91 DH lines was also genotyped with Version 2.0 DArT array as described previously.SSR primer sequences were obtained from Lowe et al.53 and from the Agriculture and AgriFood Canada Brassica Microsatellite Consortium (for more information, see http://brassica.agr.gc.ca). Genetic map locations for the majority of these markers were reported previously.54 PCR and fragment analysis methods were as described by Nelson et al.55 In addition, intron polymorphism (IP) primer sequences and methods were reported by Panjabi et al.56 New gene-based markers were developed based on publicly available cDNA sequences for fatty acid desaturase and FLC genes.44 All polymorphic markers were scored using genotype codes ‘A’ (Lynx-037DH allele), ‘B’ (Monty-028DH allele), and ‘–’ (missing value).Linkage mapping was conducted with the aid of MultiPoint 2.1 (MultiQTL Ltd, Haifa, Israel), which uses the ‘evolutionary optimization strategy’.57 We followed the general approach described by Nelson et al.58 with minor modifications. Markers showing significant allele segregation distortion (i.e. diverging from the Mendelian expectation of 1A:1B) were excluded from the analysis with DArT markers (which were scored in a dominant manner) and treated more strictly than the other markers types (which were codominant). DArT markers with very severe segregation distortion (<U+03C7>2, P < 0.0001) were discarded before commencing linkage mapping on the basis that these may represent >1 locus, while DArT markers with less extreme segregation distortion (<U+03C7>2, P < 0.001) were included in the analysis but only as ‘attached’ markers (see explanation of this term below). Some codominant SSR, IP, and gene-based markers with very significant segregation distortion (<U+03C7>2, P < 0.0001) were included in the linkage analysis but were only permitted to act as ‘attached’ markers.Iterative clustering analysis began at recombination frequency: rf = 0.14 and was increased at 0.02 increments to a maximum of 0.30. Linkage groups were assigned chromosome names and orientated using microsatellite markers mapped in reference populations.54 Recombination frequencies between high-quality ‘framework’ markers were transformed to Kosambi distances in centiMorgans. ‘Redundant’ markers (those with identical map positions to their respective framework markers) and lower quality ‘attached’ markers (those with less well-supported map positions) were integrated into the most appropriate positions in framework marker map. As a quality control measure, marker genotyping scores that introduced singletons into the genotyping matrix of framework markers were re-checked to distinguish apparently true double crossover events from scoring errors. Care was taken not to over-correct the data such that apparently true double crossover events were retained in the scoring matrix. After correcting clear marker scoring errors, genetic interval sizes were recalculated.3. Results3.1. Assessment of genetic diversityA total of 1547 high-quality DArT markers were polymorphic in a set of 89 contemporary cultivars and elite rapeseed lines from breeding programmes. The call rate ranged from 78.9 to 100% with an average of 96.7% and scoring reproducibility was 100% for all selected markers. The PIC values of individual DArT markers ranged from 0.02 to 0.5 (original data not shown), with an average of 0.3. Similarity coefficients (J) based on the binary matrix between individual lines ranged from 0.50 to 0.93.The hierarchical cluster analysis discriminated all 89 genotypes of rapeseed into three major clusters (I, II, and III; Fig. 1), but clear differences were observed within these clusters, which were generally consistent with their phenology and genetic lineage. The cluster I consisted of a large number of accessions requiring vernalization for flowering such as ‘Fan023’, ‘Fan 028’, ‘Fan168’, ‘Qu1104’, ‘Yu178’, ‘Zhongyou821’, ‘P624’, ‘03-p74-6’, ‘04-p34’, ‘Carousel-10’, ‘Major’, ‘Expander’, ‘Drakker’, and ‘Mutu 98-1’ (Fig. 1). These varieties originated from China, France, and Japan (Table 1). Clusters II and III consisted of the Australian cultivars or their derivatives. In Cluster III, ‘RocketCL’, ‘Surpass400’, ‘Surpass402CL’, ‘Surpass404CL’, ‘Surpass501TT’, ‘Surpass603CL’, ‘Hyola 50’, and ‘Hyola60’ (bred by Pacific Seeds); ‘Marnoo’ and ‘Tatyoon’ (bred by Department of Primary Industries, Victoria); and ‘TawrifficTT’ (bred by Nuseed) showed strong grouping. Several subclades were evident in cluster II, and comprised a range of rapeseed cultivars bred by different Australian breeding programmes (Table 1), as many of them share the same parents in their pedigrees.59 The cultivars released by Pioneer: ‘46C40’, ‘45C05’, ‘46C76’, ‘44C73’, ‘46Y78’, ‘45Y77’, and ‘44Y06’ showed tight genetic relationship with ‘Ag-Spectrum’ and ‘Rainbow’ and grouped together in subclade in cluster II. Likewise, a discrete grouping of triazine tolerant cultivars (‘ATR’- and ‘TT’) was also evident in cluster II. These groupings were strongly related to geographic origin, parentage and selection history (http:/www.ipaustralia.gov.au/pbr/). For example, ‘45C05’ and ‘46C76’ had Rainbow and Dunkeld in their pedigrees, respectively. Despite being of the same parentage ‘Major’ and ‘Wesreo’ (Major/Oro) varieties did not show tighter grouping, and may be heterogeneous or heterozygous.

Three principal components (first three axes), explaining 25% of variation, were sufficient to represent most of the structured information generated with multivariate analysis and reconfirmed the groupings of different accessions resultant from the UPGMA-based phenogram (Supplementary Fig. S2).In order to test if the current DArT array is suitable for genetic analysis of other Brassica species, we analysed a subset of 32 genotypes representing B. rapa, B. juncea, B. carinata and investigated their genetic relationships in relation to selected B. napus cultivars representing ‘spring’ and ‘winter’ types from different breeding programmes (Table 1). Both cluster and PCA analyses differentiated different species of Brassica, as expected (Fig. 2, Supplementary Fig. S3). For example, cultivars/breeding lines of B. napus, B. rapa, B.carinata, and B. juncea clustered into distinct I–III groups. Within the B. napus cluster, two distinct subclades representing ‘winter and semi-spring cultivars’ (‘Carousel-10’, ‘Major’, ‘Norin 22’, ‘Iwao natame’, and ‘Mutu’) and ‘spring cultivars’ were clearly evident. Clustering of genotypes was consistent with their pedigrees and/or their origin (breeding programmes). Likewise, ‘Ag-Outback’ and ‘Ag-Muster’, and cultivars with suffix ‘Surpass’ share ancestry among themselves. For a general overview of Australian canola variety pedigrees, see Cowling.59 PCA of DArT data of 32 accessions also supported the grouping identified by cluster analysis. The top three principal components (dimensions) explained 58.6% of the genetic variation (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Identifying single-copy DArT markers for linkage mappingIn the 131 DH lines screened with the DArT array Version 1, 1171 DArT markers passed the standard DArT quality criteria. These criteria include minimal call rate for markers (>80%) and high reproducibility of technical replicates (average scoring consensus >99.7%). Given that B. napus is an allotetraploid species with strong residual homoeologous relationships among chromosomes, it was considered likely that some DArT markers would detect pairs of homoeologous loci rather than single loci. Therefore, <U+03C7>2 tests were used to test each DArT marker for goodness-of-fit for a one-locus model (1:1 segregation ratio of parental alleles) and for two-locus models (1:3 or 3:1 ratio of parental alleles). Only those fitting the single-locus model were retained for linkage mapping purposes. Of 1171 DArT markers scored, 644 were monomorphic, 415 had allelic ratios consistent with the one-locus model (1:1; P < 0.001), and 112 had allelic ratios consistent with the two-locus model (3:1 or 1:3; P < 0.001). In the 91 DH lines screening the Version 2 array, 1020 DArT markers passed the standard DArT quality criteria (as above). Of these, 552 were monomorphic, 351 had allelic ratios consistent with the one-locus model (1:1; P < 0.001) and 117 had allelic ratios consistent with the two-locus model (3:1 or 1:3; P < 0.001). Markers that were putatively single-locus were combined from both DArT analyses to give 444 DArT loci that were used for subsequent linkage mapping. There were few inconsistencies between independent DArT analyses, which were entered as missing values in the combined DArT marker set.3.3. Linkage mappingIn total, 584 marker loci (comprising 437 DArT, 135 SSR, 6 IP, and 6 gene-based markers) were used to generate a B. napus linkage map based on the BnaLMDH mapping population (Fig. 3, Supplementary Fig. S4; all scoring data provided in Supplementary Table S3, and summarized in Supplementary Table S4). Of these 584 loci, 329 were high-quality, non-redundant ‘framework’ markers, 209 were ‘redundant’ markers (i.e. co-segregated with respective framework markers), and 46 were lower quality ‘attached’ markers with less well-defined map positions. In consistent with the haploid chromosome number for B. napus (n = 19), there were 19 linkage groups with the shortest linkage group (A08) being 61.3 cM, the longest (C4) being 186.2 cM, and a total map length of 2288 cM (Supplementary Table S4). There were also two small clusters (Cluster-1 and Cluster-2) comprising four and three loci, respectively. There were also four markers (brPb-661033, brPb-662131, brPb-809033, and sN2675) that remained unlinked.

Map distances are given in centiMorgan (cM) on the left of sample linkage groups.Using SSR markers with known map locations, all linkage groups were unambiguously assigned chromosome names and orientated relative to the reference map.54 Alignment to the reference map revealed that this map encompasses ~90% of the known B. napus genome with notably incomplete coverage of chromosomes A07 (bottom half) and A08 (top half). DArT marker were unevenly distributed, with the proportion of DArT loci ranging from 31% (chromosome C5) to 90% (chromosome A03), with an average of 70% across all chromosomes (Supplementary Table S4).Several regions of the linkage map comprised markers with allelic segregation ratios diverging from the Mendelian expectation (1:1 for a DH population; Supplementary Table S3). The most significantly skewed deviations (<U+03C7>2, P < 0.001) were on linkage groups A01, A03, and A06 and encompassed both DArT and SSR markers. We found evidence of high frequency of homoeologous recombination between chromosomes A07 and C6, as shown by the tendency of A07 and C6 to cluster together during the linkage mapping process, which had to be manually separated.4. DiscussionWe developed and applied a high-throughput DArT marker array for the first time in rapeseed. We demonstrated that this whole-genome profiling technology is useful for establishing phylogenetic relationships among varieties and elite breeding Brassica lines and for construction of linkage map that has extensive genome coverage of the rapeseed genome.4.1. DArT markers for genetic diversity assessmentIn this study, we utilized up to 1547 DArT markers for the assessment of genetic diversity among accessions of rapeseed and related species. A number of these markers were distributed across the genome in the ‘BnaLMDH’ population (Fig. 3). Previously, only a limited number of markers were used to analyse genetic diversity in rapeseed. For example, Wang et al.12 used 18 SSR primer pairs to generate 112 polymorphic features for genetic diversity analysis of 48 Australian rapeseed cultivars while Chen et al.60 used 55 SSR primer pairs to generate 287 polymorphic features for genetic diversity analysis of 72 cultivars. DArT markers with extensive genome coverage, developed in this study, will provide better estimate of the extent of genetic diversity. DArT markers have the additional advantage of being based largely on SNP variation, which more closely reflects normal genome evolutionary behaviour compared with SSRs that have high rates of mutation.61 Therefore, this DArT resource constitutes a significant improvement in marker density, and possibly quality, compared with that possible with marker technology previously available for rapeseed.We employed both cluster and PCA analyses for studying genetic diversity and population structure. Results suggested that genetic diversity exists within the rapeseed germplasm. Most of the Australian varieties were grouped into distinct clusters according their common ancestry.59,62 For example, ‘Yickadee’, ‘Maluka’, ‘Eureka’, ‘Shiralee’, ‘Rainbow’, ‘45C75’, ‘44Y06’, ‘Ag-Spectrum’, ‘46C76’, and ‘45Y77’ share pedigrees with each other59 (Patel personal communication. http://www.ipaustralia.gov.au/pbr/index.shtml). This confirms that gene flow into Australian breeding programmes was restricted before the time of release of these varieties.59 Furthermore, all Australian varieties up to the year 2000 were developed from the same set of donor sources collected from Japan, France, Poland, Germany, Sweden, and Canada.59 However, some accessions overlapped or distributed across well-defined clusters, for example ‘Karoo’ (Fig 1). This could be due to the fact that rapeseed (syn canola) is a predominantly self-pollinated crop; however, outcrossing may occur, ranging from 5 to 36% under field conditions.63,64 Therefore, heterogeneity and heterozygosity in some varieties, such as ‘Karoo’, is very likely. This phenomena has been reported in previous studies,11 especially in the Australian cultivars which were developed using open-pollinated pedigree selection without ‘intentional selfing’.62 Furthermore, many breeding programmes have intentionally released ‘genetically mixed’ varieties to cope with environmental variation and biotic stresses.63,64 Phenograms also clearly differentiated ‘winter’ and ‘spring’ types, which represent to different gene pools as described previously using RFLP markers.8,65 Our results are consistent with previous studies which showed that rapeseed accessions can be grouped on the basis of flowering habit (winter and spring type), and on the basis of origin by geographical region and breeding organizations.8,9,12,65–67DArT markers also enabled us to assess genetic diversity among four agricultural Brassica species that are extensively being used in rapeseed improvement programmes. Although we have not sampled extensively these species, DArT markers allowed us to differentiate B. rapa (AA), B. napus (AACC), B. juncea (AABB), and B. carinata (BBCC) on their polymorphism patterns. Therefore, the current DArT platform is suitable for genotyping of different Brassica species especially those having ‘A’ and ‘C’ genomes and may facilitate alien gene introgression from related species.4.2. Implication of diversityThis DArT marker analysis supports previous studies that show that rapeseed accessions from Australia, Europe, and China are genetically differentiated.60 Crossing between these differentiated sources can be used to enlarge genetic diversity in rapeseed breeding programmes.59 Genetic distance estimates would assist breeding programmes to maximize the level of variation in their germplasm and to exploit high heterosis in hybrid varieties. DArT allelic profiles produced in this study will also be useful for fast and accurate DNA fingerprinting of elite Australian rapeseed genotypes and identifying loci associated with traits of agronomic importance using association mapping strategy.4.3. Genome-wide coverage of DArT markersA genetic map of ‘BnaLMDH’ was constructed using 437 DArT, 135 SSR, 6 IP, and 6 gene-based markers. These markers provided good coverage across all 19 linkage groups, corresponding to all 10 chromosomes of A and 9 chromosomes of C genome of B. napus. Good genome coverage could be partly attributed to the enrichment of the genic regions with the use of PstI. The map of ‘BnaLMDH’ population covering 2288 cM is comparable with the previous genetic linkage maps of B. napus, spanning distances of 1173–2619 cM.68–70 Approximately 10% of the DArT loci were found to be duplicated in this study. Therefore, a limited effect of homoplasmy is anticipated on the usage of DArT in diversity analysis in allotetraploid B. napus.5. ConclusionWe developed the DArT platform for genetic analysis of Brassica genomes and demonstrated its usefulness in genetic diversity assessment and genetic map construction. Our results have proved that DArT technology is amenable for various downstream applications such as cluster analysis and map construction, including for trait-marker association analyses.66 It can supplement marker systems that cannot be analysed in a highly parallel genotyping format, such as SSR markers. SSRs are suitable to distinguish heterozygotes due to their, in general, co-dominance. Besides, excessive stutter bands and overlapping bands due to coamplification of loci also limit the usefulness of SSR markers in rapeseed. In light of the current paucity of high-density SNP assay formats for rapeseed and the embryonic nature of genotyping by sequencing technologies, the development of the DArT platform for rapeseed is a significant development for identifying trait-marker association, genetic diversity, and population genetics studies and whole-genome selection in this important crop species.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingAuthors are thankful to the NSW Agricultural Genomic Centre funded under BioFirst Initiative of NSW Government, and various organizations for supporting research under the DArT International Rapeseed Consortium led by Dr Kilian.

IntroductionCyanobacteria are capable of oxygenic photosynthesis; they are thought to be the progenitor of plant plastids. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is one of the most widely used cyanobacterial species for genetic studies for several major reasons; (i) it is naturally competent by incorporating exogenous DNA into cells that is integrated into the genome by homologous recombination at high frequency;1–3 (ii) it grows heterotrophically in the presence of glucose;3,4 (iii) the entire genome sequence was determined early on by Kaneko et al.5 The availability of the entire genome sequence facilitated post-genomic investigations such as transcriptome-, proteome-, and functional genomics studies.6The original strain of Synechocystis was isolated from California freshwater by Kunisawa and colleagues and called the Berkeley strain;7 it was deposited in the Pasteur Culture Collection (PCC strain) and the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC strain). Williams3 subsequently isolated the glucose-tolerant (GT) strain from the ATCC strain.3 The Kazusa strain, whose genome sequence was published in 1996,5 is a derivative of a GT strain. A single representative clone of the GT strain was established for complete genome sequencing as the Kazusa strain; other strains were maintained and transferred without further cloning such as single colony isolation.8 Therefore, four substrains, PCC-, ATCC-, GT-, and Kazusa strains, all derived from the original Berkeley strain, were distributed to a number of laboratories although all of them were grouped together under the name Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803.9 Ikeuchi and Tabata8 reported that each substrain had specific mutations such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and indels, and some exhibited a specific phenotype. Some of the mutated loci that were different from the sequence in the database derived from the Kazusa strain have been identified such as a SNP,10 indels,6,11–13 and IS mobilization.14 However, the total number of mutations in the whole genome of each strain remained unknown and sequence variations in these major strains can be expected to raise problems in the evaluation of phenotypes of mutants constructed from these strains. The history of these major substrains and additional substrains, isolated as a single colony from the PCC- and GT strain (GT-I strain; the standard strain in Dr Ikeuchi's group) was summarized by Ikeuchi and Tabata.8 The single colonies isolated from the PCC strain were designated PCC-P (positive phototaxis) strain and PCC-N (negative phototaxis) strain based on the direction of phototactic movement.15 A derivative of the GT-I strain that acquired high light tolerance and a glucose-sensitive phenotype was designated the WL strain, which has an SNP in the pmgA gene.16,17 Thus, there are two fundamental problems for post-genomic research in bacterial molecular genetics. One is the heterogeneity of cells in the frozen stock of the culture collection centres; the other is the frequent spontaneous mutation in bacterial genomes, an event that may be unavoidable during the long cultivation of bacterial cells. As revealed in Bacillus subtilis, whole-genome resequencing is a powerful solution for obtaining the sequence information of such spontaneous mutants.18Without question, laboratories should start their post-genomic research with genome sequence data of the ‘reference’ or ‘standard’ strain. We deciphered the three substrains of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, i.e. PCC-P, PCC-N, and GT-I, to reconstruct the informatics basis of the molecular biology of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. We identified a number of SNPs and indels in these substrains and introduced a genetic strategy to identify the mutated loci on a genome-wide level using the massive parallel sequencer. Especially, determination of the genome sequence of PCC substrains will widely contribute cyanobacterial researches using the frozen stock cells supplied from the PCC.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Bacterial strains and genomic DNASynechocystis PCC-P, PCC-N, and GT-I strains were maintained as frozen stocks in the laboratory of Dr Masahiko Ikeuchi at The University of Tokyo, Japan. The PCC-P and PCC-N strains that exhibited positive- or negative-direction movement under phototaxis test conditions, respectively, were isolated by Yoshihara et al.19 as a single colony from frozen stock obtained from the French Pasteur Culture Collection (PCC strain; see catalogue of strains.9). Genomic DNA was extracted with the hot-phenol method.162.2. Sequencing methodsDNA was uniformly sheared into 300-bp portions using Adaptive Focused Acoustics (Covaris Inc., Woburn, MA, USA). We constructed a DNA library with a median insert size of 300 bp for a paired-end read format. The quality of the DNA library was checked with the Sanger method by Escherichia coli transformation of aliquots of the library solution. The library was sequenced on a Genome Analyser II (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA). Sample preparation, cluster generation, and 50-base paired-end sequencing were according to the manufacturer's protocols with minor modifications (Illumina paired-end cluster generation kit GAII ver. 2, 36-cycle sequencing kit ver. 3) with multiplex method using the single lane of the 8 lane flow-cell. Image analysis and ELAND alignment were with Illumina's Pipeline Analysis software ver. 1.6. Sequences passing standard Illumina GA pipeline filters were retained.2.3. Mapping analyses using short-read sequencesFor short-read alignment and calling variants (SNPs and InDels), we used the short-read mapping software MAQ version 0.7.1,20 BWA ver. 0.5.1,21 and SAMtools ver. 0.1.9.22 MAQ alignments were done using the ‘easyrun’ option of the maq-pl script using the default parameter settings. The SNP filtering was performed using the default parameters except for the minimum consensus quality for SNPs (-q 40). BWA alignments and the subsequent variants calling using SAMtools were done using the default parameter settings. Finally, we applied the following filtering criteria to the lists of SNPs/indels: minimum read depth for SNPs calling = 3, minimum read depth for indel calling = 10, and a 60% cut-off of the percent of aligned reads calling the SNP/indel per total mapped reads at the non-reference allele sites. We also used BWA to estimate the sequence read depth affecting the coverage and accuracy of the variant calls. Structural variations were identified using BreakDancer23 with default parameters.2.4. Mapping analyses using contigs assembled de novoRead sequences were assembled de novo with the Velvet assembly programme.24 For optimization of the hash value of the assembly process we used the N50 size. The de novo assembled contigs were mapped on the genome sequence of a database derived from the Kazusa strain using MUMmer sequence alignment package25 with default settings. We then employed show-SNPs functions of the MUMmer program to produce lists of SNPs/indels which were applied the filtering criteria describe above.2.5. Annotation and creation of the SNP/indel listThe list of SNPs/indels was then annotated with in-house developed software Variant Annotator (VA) that was specifically designed to check amino acid substitutions attributable to the large number of identified SNPs/indels using Genbank annotation files. We used the GenBank, RefSeq, cyanobacterial database Cyanobase (http://genome.kazusa.or.jp/cyanobase), CyanoClust,26 and also ORF information of the GT-S strain,27 which is the recently resequenced substrain of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, for precise annotation of each ORF.2.6. Capillary sequencing with the Sanger method for SNP/indel confirmationAbout 200-base genomic regions around the SNPs and indels called by the mapping programmes were amplified by PCR and sequenced on a capillary sequencer with the Sanger method using the commercial sequence service of MACROGEN (Tokyo, Japan). To confirm the SNPs located near IS elements or repetitive regions, the longer DNA fragments were amplified to avoid the amplification of other homologous regions in the Synechocystis genome. The primers used for confirmation are listed in Supplementary Table S1.2.7. Uploading the genome sequence in the databaseShort-read data, obtained on a Genome Analyzer II (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA), of the substrains of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, PCC-P, PCC-N, and GT-I, were deposited in the DRA (DDBJ Sequence Read Archive; http://trace.ddbj.nig.ac.jp/DRASearch/); the accession number is DRA000401. The genome sequences and gene annotations of the substrain GT-I, PCC-P, and PCC-N were also deposited in the DDBJ/GenBank/EMBL database with the accession numbers for each substrain, GT-I (AP012276), PCC-P (AP012278), and PCC-N (AP012277).2.8. Phylogenetic analysis of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 substrainsPhylogenetic relationship of various strains was estimated by the maximum parsimony method by assuming that both base change and indel are treated as a single event. The computation was performed by the dolpenny software of the Phylip package version 3.67,28 using the polymorphism option. Each branch length was set as the number of events occurring along the branch.3. Results3.1. Analytical scheme applied to the massive short-read data obtained by next-generation sequencingThe amplified DNA library was sequenced by GAII with 50-base paired-end methods using the parameter settings described in Materials and methods section. We obtained 250, 257, and 221 Mb read data for GT-I, PCC-N, and PCC-P substrains, respectively (Table 1). These read depths correspond to more than 60 times the genome size of Synechocystis. Read data were mapped using three analyses to identify the genomic position of the SNPs, indels, and rearrangements (Fig. 1): (i) BWA21 and MAQ20 for mapping analysis using raw read data; (ii) Velvet24 and MUMmer25 for mapping analysis using de novo assembled contigs; and (iii) BreakDancer23 for rearrangement analysis such as IS movement. The number of mutations was called by each programme and passed through the filter settings of the SAMtools program22 (Table 1). Distributions of averaged read depth in each 1 kb along with the entire genome, obtained by BWA and MAQ were shown in Supplemental Fig. S1. At least 15 times read depth was obtained even in the lowest read depth region. It also indicates that patterns of the read depth distribution depend on the algorithm of each mapping programme. The mapping programmes BWA, MAQ, and MUMer called 76, 69, and 85 potential mutation points, respectively, for the GT-I strain as primary data, 89, 75, and 109 points for the PCC-P strain, and 78, 79, and 104 points for the PCC-N strain. To confirm these results, we checked the sequence around all these loci by Sanger sequencing; regions of ~200 bp were amplified around the position of the mutations. Depending on the parameter settings, read depth and sequence specificity, it happens that common SNPs in all three substrains were detected only in one or two substrains in each programme. Even if the SNP is called only in one strain, we performed Sanger sequencing of the same locus in all three strains. Whole oligo DNA primers prepared for PCR reactions are listed in Supplemental Table S1.

Combinatorial use of the mapping programmes contributes to the identification of SNPs and indelsConfirmation by Sanger sequencing alerted to a number of false-positive SNP- and indel-calls. Final numbers of SNPs/indels in each substrain were only about 20–40% of the called numbers by each programme as shown in Table 1. Most of the false-positive SNPs or indels were located in repetitive regions or in highly homologous genes in the Synechocystis genome. We expected that the cut-off value of mapping programmes as 60% is enough to detect a number of heterogeneous SNPs of Synechocystis which has multi-copy genome, because 80% SNPs were called as heterogeneous SNPs by BWA in case of GT-I strain. However, we could not detect any heterogeneous SNPs among them by the Sanger method. It indicates that there are technical problems in expecting the total number of the heterogeneous SNPs in the whole genome using cut-off value settings or base-call percentage data obtained by these mapping programmes. On the other hand, all 16 SNPs called homogeneous SNPs by BWA in GT-I strain were also confirmed by the Sanger method. The total number of mutations confirmed by the Sanger method is shown in Fig. 2 with the number of mutations including false-positive data in parenthesis. These numbers are the sum of results obtained for the three substrains. We found that the combinatorial use of several programmes is necessary for the comprehensive detection of SNPs/indels and for the identification of mutations. Mutation loci detected commonly by all three programmes were more reliable than that detected by only the single programme (Fig. 2). Difference of the distribution pattern of the read depth in each mapping programme also suggests that combination use of several programmes is more adequate (Supplemental Fig. S1). However, it is worth noting, SNPs/indels identified commonly by three programmes covered only 60% of the total number of mutations. The correct detection of IS movements reported by Okamoto et al.14 was possible only with BreakDancer, a programme developed for the detection of genome rearrangements.23Diagram of the mutations identified by each programme.

Numbers labelled with an asterisk contain miss-called results indicated by parenthesis in Tables 2 and 3.3.3. Comparison of the identified SNPs/indels and the genome sequence in the databaseThe confirmed mutations are listed in Tables 2 and 3. The three substrains, GT-I, PCC-P, and PCC-N, manifested at least 22 common different sites compared with the sequence of the Kazusa strain in the database. Among these mutation sites, 15 sites were different from the database sequence, but not real differences in the genomic loci as revealed by Tajima et al.27 (Table 2). We also found that there are totally 14 mutations between the GT/Kazusa- and the PCC-P/PCC-N strains (Table 3). The PCC-P and PCC-N substrains contained three and eight additional specific mutations, respectively (Table 3). These may be potential mutations that elicited the known difference in the phototactic phenotype of the PCC substrains. For example, the PCC-N substrain has mutation in the gspE2 (pilB2) gene for pilus assembly, which also moderately affects the transformation efficiency.15 The PCC-N strain also has a 12-base deletion in the kinase domain of the hik33 gene for the histidine kinase without a frameshift. Hik33 is the multi-stress sensor in Synechocystis and it is conserved in all cyanobacterial species.29–31 This suggests that this substrain may lose the Hik33-dependent regulation of global gene expression, although the relationship between hik33 and phototaxis remains to be determined.

Several indel regions miscalled as SNP by MAQ and BWA were shown in parentheses.A part of the indel regions was miss-called as SNPs by the mapping programmes. We aligned the genome sequence of the substrains around the indels (Fig. 3) and found that these indels were located in the middle of two direct repeat- or direct repeat-like sequences. Interestingly, these direct repeats found in the deleted regions were not common sequence. Mapping analyses using de novo assembled contigs (Velvet and MUMmer) help to correct the false-positive SNP/indel-calls made by mapping programmes such as BWA and MAQ (Table 2).

At these SNP loci, we detected a second peak from the other nucleotide. As the Synechocystis genome is multi-copy, some of the genome copies may harbour heterogeneous SNPs. These loci were not in a multi-repeat region of the genome.A phylogenetic scheme of the history of the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 substrains is presented in Fig. 4. The predicted phylogenetic relationship of various strains indicated that the putative root may exist between the PCC branch and the GT branch.

Problems associated with the heterogeneity of frozen stocks of bacterial strainsFrozen stocks in culture centres are basically stored as heterogeneous cell groups of the particular bacteria, such as E. coli K-12 MG1655.32 Thus, when aliquots of the frozen cells are thawed, selection bias due to the growth conditions arises; this affects the major genotype of the cells in culture. We posit that the heterogeneity of cells in different laboratories affected the results of genetic research or phenotypic analyses and we suggest that post-genomic research on cyanobacteria in the next generation should be based on resequenced strains as the new reference for each laboratory. In studies on post-genomic science using various mutants, it is better to prepare the frozen stock cells of single colonies one by one and also of the parental cell as soon as possible after the isolation of the mutants. It is also unquestionable that long-term cultivation of the cells on the gels or in the liquid cultures is not appropriate to keep the genotype of the cells.4.2. Potential factors that affect phenotypic differences in 6803 substrainsWe found a small number of substrain-specific mutations in PCC-P and PCC-N strains. It can be expected that a mutation accounts for the difference in the phototactic phenotype of PCC-P and PCC-N strains.19 Furthermore, the 14 mutations found in the GT/Kazusa- and the PCC-P/PCC-N strains suggest that their loci may affect the cell motility of these strains8 or their glucose tolerance.3 Our findings may be useful in functional studies on the gene that is disrupted by SNPs or indels in specific substrains. As Kamei et al.12 or Okamoto et al.14 suggested, the real function of several genes could only be studied in specific substrains which have the original nucleotide sequence without any SNPs, indels, or IS insertions.4.3. Indels located between two direct repeats result in miss-calls by the mapping programmeConfirmation of our results with the Sanger method revealed that specific deletion patterns were miss-called or undetected at high frequency by mapping analysis of short-read type data. Several deleted regions in the middle of direct-repeat sequences were miss-called as SNPs or undetected (Tables 2 and 3). Alignment of the DNA sequence of the three substrains clearly showed direct repeats on both sides of the deletion locus (Fig. 3). After the deletion event only a single direct repeat sequence remained, leading to the hypothesis that the deletion was due to self-crossover. At present we do not know what mechanisms or factors trigger these deletions, but caution should be exercised when we perform long-term cultivation of cyanobacterial cells. This is also a technical problem of mapping analysis to detect the exact positions of SNPs and indels using massive short-read data of next-generation sequencers.4.4. Problems raised by heterozygous and homozygous SNPsIn this analysis, we found that the threshold value for SNP detection by BWA and MAQ was more than 60% of read data covering the SNP positions. However, Synechocystis sp. strain PCC6803 has a multi-copy genome,33 suggesting that the genome contains unidentified heterozygous SNPs below the threshold value. It is technically difficult to identify all heterozygous SNPs in the genome; if we lower the threshold, the number of false-positive SNPs increases drastically. Mutations hidden as minor heterozygous SNPs may become major SNPs under specific conditions and affect the cell phenotype, an observation reported by Hihara and Ikeuchi16 and Hihara et al.,17 who studied the pmgA mutant. The active retention of heterogeneity may be a strategy of cyanobacteria for acclimation to environmental changes. Heterogeneous SNPs found in the same locus in several substrains such as the loci 1192983 and 3098707 were the candidates to understand such mechanisms. The detection of minor heterozygous SNPs is a future problem for mapping using massive parallel sequencing.In this study, we identified a number of differences in the genome sequence of laboratory strains and published sequence data derived from the Kazusa strain. Resequence data on PCC substrains will be useful for considering evolutionary events among Synechocystis intra-species. For the reconstruction of informatics in post-genomic studies on Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, resequence analysis is effective and represents a powerful genetic strategy to identify potential mutation loci in spontaneous mutants with altered phenotypes.Supplementary dataSupplementary data is available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (S0801025).Supplementary data"

IntroductionThe observation that specific DNA sequences favour the formation of nucleosomes1–6 raises the possibility that sequence plays a significant role in organizing nucleosomal arrays.7,8 Recently, computational models for sequence-based prediction of nucleosome positioning in Saccharomyces cerevisiae were proposed.9,10 These models are generative and used dinucleotide and pentanucleotide frequencies collected from a training set of aligned nucleosome-bound sequence to predict histone–DNA interactions. Peckham et al.11 proposed a complementary computational model that is discriminative, rather than generative, and that focuses on only sequences that show the strongest signals of nucleosome occupancy or vacancy in a microarray-based assay of S. cerevisiae. Miele et al.12 used sequence-dependent DNA flexibility and an intrinsic curvature to predict the nucleosome occupancy along the genomes of S. cerevisiae and Drosophila melanogaster. Morozov et al.13 used bending data to design both strong and weak histone-binding sequences, and measured the corresponding free energies of nucleosome formation in order to provide a physical explanation for the intrinsic sequence dependence of histone–DNA interactions. A reference map of nucleosome positions in S. cerevisiae has recently been compiled through the analysis of several genome-wide data sets produced in various laboratories and reported at http://atlas.bx.psu.edu/, where it has been made available as a Microsoft Excel worksheet named ‘additional data file 1’.14 In yeast, non-random positioning of nucleosomes has been established mainly at promoters, where a nucleosome-free region (NFR) is followed by a highly positioned nucleosome at the +1 position. The +1 nucleosome forms a barrier against which subsequent nucleosomes with a decreasing stability are located.15 The role of intrinsic DNA sequences either in in vitro or in vivo nucleosome positioning has recently been at the centre of a debate16–19 about the existence of a genomic code for nucleosome positioning. One central topic of the debate concerns the correct use of the terms ‘positioning’ and ‘occupancy’, which are both connected to the uncertainty on the location of the histone dyad axis on the DNA sequence. In this paper, we adopt the following simple nomenclature: ‘positioning’ locates the dyad axis with an uncertainty of a few base pairs, whereas ‘occupancy’ allows reaching a few tens of  base pairs, and this error in location is called fuzziness. It is generally accepted that the DNA sequence influences, to some extent, in vivo nucleosome positioning, which is regulated by many other additional epigenetic factors. In yeast, the role of chromatin-remodelling enzymes, such as isw2, has extensively been studied and a map of genome-wide nucleosome positions in an isw2 deletion strain has been reported in the ‘additional data file 1’.14 The study of isw2 has implications for the predictions of nucleosome positions on the basis of the DNA sequence alone and it has been hypothesized that the loss of isw2 would allow nucleosomes to adopt their inherent positioning preference.20 In previous papers,21,22 we reported a correlation between the stability of nucleosomes and the presence of a symmetrical distribution of distances from the nucleosomal dyad axis at specific points. These points represent the locations of phosphates along the DNA minor groove, where histone–DNA electrostatic bonds are formed. These symmetric distances were calculated by means of a tetranucleotide helical rise code22 applied to known nucleosome-positioning sequences. In that paper, the presence of symmetric distances was mainly correlated to the probability of finding nucleosomes, and on the other hand, we succeeded in observing the absence of symmetric distances in NFRs, which are usually found in vivo at the transcription start sites (TSSs) of human promoters. We recently extended our analysis to yeast promoters and observed that helical rise profiles of NFR sequences exhibit lower mean values than those obtained for adjacent sequences where nucleosomes are usually found. In addition, we argued that the generation of mean helical rise curves and the presence of a symmetric shape in their profile could be related to the presence of nucleosomes. These preliminary results prompted us to analyse the whole yeast genome in a systematic way, so that we generated profiles of helical rise values averaged by various smoothing windows (see methods) and searched for possible correlations between helical rise profiles and known nucleosome positions. We hypothesized that the histone protein begins to interact with DNA exploring at least 26 bp, a length where six principal interactions between the DNA phosphates and the basic amino acids of H3 and H4 histones are formed.23 Once the optimal site of interaction has been found, DNA continues to wrap around the histone protein and 56 bp are involved in the formation of six additional interactions. When 90 bp are engaged in the complex, about a complete turn of DNA is wrapped, while the final form of the nucleosome is achieved when ~150 bp make one and three quarters of a turn of DNA wrap around the histone protein. We obtained then our helical rise profiles by a set of smoothing windows of 26, 56, 90 and 150 bp, respectively, in order to account for the start and the end of histone–DNA interaction. We also compared our helical rise profiles with those obtained by the dinucleotide frequency method developed by Segal et al.9,10 and the results are available at http://genie.weizmann.ac.il/software/nucleo_prediction.html.2. Materials and methods2.1. Nucleosome positionsData referring to nucleosome positioning in S. cerevisiae and D. melanogaster were collected from reference maps of nucleosome positions reported at http://atlas.bx.psu.edu/. Nucleosome positions of Plasmodium falciparum were downloaded from plasmoDB (www.plasmoDB.org) and those of human chromosome 20, derived from the experimental data of Schones et al.,24 were downloaded from http://www.gri.seu.edu.cn/icons.25Nucleosome positions derived by computational analysis of human chromosome 20 were derived from http://www.gri.seu.edu.cn/icons.2.2. DNA sequencesThe whole nucleotide sequences of S. cerevisiae, D. melanogaster and P. falciparum were downloaded from the NCBI database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The DNA sequence of human chromosome 20 was downloaded from the UCSC genome database, built hg 18 (http://genome.ucsc.edu). DNA sequences of 1-kb long (symmetric with respect to the potential dyad axis) were extracted (hg 18 built).2.3. Computational analysis3. Results and discussion3.1. Symmetrical helical rise profilesThe DNA sequences were downloaded from the NCBI database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) and transformed, by our tetranucleotide code, into an array of consecutive helical rise values. In yeast, this primary array was averaged by means of four different smoothing windows and, for each window, 61 110 mapped dyad nucleosome positions, belonging to the reference set included in the additional data file 1,14 were used to obtain 61 110 profiles of 1-kb-long mean helical rise, each containing 500 bp located upstream of the central dyad axis and 500 downstream. For each window, the average of the 61 110 profiles was performed for the reference data set and reported in Fig. 1A as a solid black line. Same approach was used for any of the six other data sets contained in the additional data file 1,14 returning helical rise profiles (data not shown) closely similar to those generated for the reference set. An analogous procedure was executed for the 54 907 nucleosome positions of an isw2 deletion strain of S. cerevisiae20 reported in the same additional data file 1.14Helical rise profiles of nucleosome positions.

Nucleosome dyad positions are aligned at bp number 0; 500 bp upstream and downstream of this point are shown. Black dots with (146-bp long) horizontal bars mark positions of mapped nucleosomes. Colour figures can be found in the online version of this paper.The results obtained for the isw2 deletion strain are shown in Fig. 1A as a solid pink line. In the same figure are shown, as markers, the positions of five nucleosomes that cover 147 bp each and are mutually separated by 18 bp of linker DNA as reported for yeast.14 In each of the four panels both the reference and the isw2 curves are symmetric with respect to the dyad axis located at bp number 0. This behavior is more pronounced for the 90-bp long smoothing window, which represents a length equivalent to a full turn of DNA wrapped around the histone core. When applied to the DNA sequence alone, the helical rise method shows that yeast nucleosomes are positioned at higher helical rise values than their linkers. The symmetry of the central peak supports our early results22 on the correlation between nucleosome stability and symmetrical distribution of helical rise values around the nucleosomal dyad axis. In the four panels of Fig. 1A, the mean helical rise values of each isw2 profile are systematically larger than those of the reference set. Moreover, the reference profiles corresponding to the 26- and the 56-bp-long smoothing windows, unlike their isw2 counterparts, are both characterized by a central peak clearly split into two adjacent maxima. These maxima are separated by ~60 bp and their disappearance is therefore evident in the helical rise profiles obtained with smoothing windows of 90 and 150 bp reported in Fig. 1A. An explanation for the differences in the rise value and peak shape between the isw2 and reference samples may be found considering the role of the isw2-remodelling enzymes in S. cerevisiae. It has been reported that isw2 enzymes’ reposition nucleosomes near promoter regions in order to suppress antisense transcription; the repositioning can range from a few bp to ±73 bp and in an isw2 deletion strain, nucleosomes tend to place themselves at their preferred targets, selected on the basis of the DNA sequence alone.20 Our algorithm, based on a sequence-dependent approach, correctly shows preferential sites when the effect of isw2 is silenced. The presence of the double peaks, shown in Fig. 1 for the 26- and the 56-bp-long smoothing windows in the wild-type profiles, is due to the action of isw2, which repositions nucleosomes on the DNA sequence. The helical rise can actually render nucleosome occupancy; indeed, in the reference sample, isw2 remodellers are active and the mapped nucleosome positions are split away from the central position; on the other hand, due to the convergence of the isw2 nucleosome positions towards a single maximum value in the central peak, the isw2 average profiles are always higher than those corresponding to the reference set.Shown in Fig. 1B are the helical rise profiles obtained for the single chromosome I of S. cerevisiae. The shape of the black and pink curves (reference and isw2 data set, respectively) is identical to that reported for the whole yeast genome shown in Fig. 1A at the smoothing window of 56 bp. Also shown in Fig 1B with a grey continuous line is a control curve obtained for the DNA sequence of chromosome I with dyad positions scrambled with those of chromosome II. The loss of symmetry and the random shape of the scrambled curve are evident.3.2. Peak height and nucleosome occupancyAnother characteristic of the profiles shown in Fig. 1 is represented by the lower values of the mean helical rise for nucleosomes adjacent to the central one. As to this feature, a preliminary attempt was made to understand how the peak height of the helical rise profiles is correlated to nucleosome stability. We reprocessed the reference data set in the additional data file 1,14 where nucleosome occupancy is expressed in the range from 1 to 7 arbitrary units, classifying nucleosome positions as: very stable (peak height >4, comprising about 24 600 samples), stable (2< peak height <4, comprising about 29 800 samples) and weak (peak height <2, comprising about 5600 samples). The results obtained for a smoothing window of 90 bp are reported in Fig. 2, where the corresponding overall profile from Fig. 1A is also shown. Data displayed in Fig. 2 state a clear direct relationship between the helical rise peak height and nucleosome occupancy; therefore, our method can be considered to unambiguously assess nucleosome occupancy in a quantitative manner. Furthermore, once again the peaks neighbouring the central maximum exhibit a lower height, except for those marked as weak and represented by a blue solid line. A statistical test (Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney) was performed between the distribution of helical rise at dyad positions and the distribution of the helical rise at random positions. A P-value smaller than E-16 assures us that the helical rise is not randomly distributed with respect to nucleosome maps. Peak height analysis of nucleosome positions.

Helical rise profiles of promotersThe above-mentioned features should reflect the general organization of yeast nucleosomes covering transcribed genes. Figure 3 presents the helical rise profiles of YAL053W, an RNA-polymerase II transcribed gene lying on chromosome 1 whose mapped nucleosome positions are reported in the additional data file 1.14 In panel A, the helical rise profile of YAL053W smoothed at 90 bp, is shown as a solid black line. Nucleosome positions and peak heights are reported as horizontal bars on the bottom and the top of the figure, respectively. Near the TSS and the transcription termination site (TTS), marked by a green and a red dot, respectively, the rise values reach ~3.05 Å, while in the regions where the most stable nucleosomes named +2, +3, +4 etc. are located, the rise values exceed 3.25 Å. The difference of ~0.2 Å between the helical rise values of NFRs and those of stable nucleosomes may appear a modest amount, but it must be remembered that the main force involved is of electrostatic nature26 and follows Coulomb's law, which establishes that the attraction between two charges is proportional to the inverse square of the distance. In addition, the damping down of the attraction depends on the dielectric constant of the medium as well, and free DNA and histone proteins share a hydration shell with a value of dielectric constant equal to 80 due to water. When nucleosomes are formed, the hydration shell gets partially lost and the value of the dielectric constant, although not easy to calculate, is considerably reduced, with a consequent increase in coulombic attraction. The balance between the distance of charges and the stiffness of the hydration shell is likely to be involved in nucleosome formation and mobility. Moreover, it is a known fact that the DNA double helix, when wrapping around a histone in a counterclockwise sense, unwinds and gets stretched,27 with a consequent variation in the distance between charged phosphate groups along the DNA. In our opinion, the observed preference for higher helical rise values in nucleosome formation is correlated to the lower energetic cost required to stretch DNA in order to form stable interactions between negative DNA phosphates and positive histone groups. In other words, DNA wrapped around a histone protein is constrained and the release of the constraint is better achieved when the mean helical rise is >3.2 Å. In panel A of fig. 3A, the positions of isw2 nucleosomes are marked by blue horizontal bars. R emodeling of nucleosomes is manifest near NFRs, as well as in regions where the helical rise profile exhibits lower values. This feature is highlighted by the pink profile as well, that shows the occupancy level of YAL053W calculated according to the dinucleotide frequency method by Segal et al.9 The black and pink profiles share a few similarities either in the regions from position +2 to +7, where a high value of nucleosome occupancy and of helical rise are found, and in the regions surrounding NFRs like TSS and TTS where to low occupancy values high helical rise ones correspond. At positions +8 and +11 a different shape of the helical rise profiles can be observed, characterized by a dyad position at the minimum values of a ‘V’-shaped curve instead of the more usual maximum values of a ‘peak’-shaped curve. A logical inference is that the central peaks reported in Figs. 1 and 2 are averaged by the sum of both types of helical rise profiles, ‘peak’- and ‘V’-shaped, so that the average central peaks are always symmetrical but their maximum values are somehow lowered by the contribution from the ‘V’-shaped profile. It must be considered that the major contribution to the mean helical rise profile is due to the peak-shaped curves. Helical rise profiles of nucleosome positions at promoters.

Colour figures can be found in the online version of this paper.The similarities observed, in Fig. 3, between our curves and those by Segal et al. can be explained, considering that nucleosome formation depends on a first step characterized by the bending of DNA and correlated to the dinucleotide distribution, as demonstrated by Segal et al.9 The following step is associated with the stability of bonds formed between DNA and histone proteins, and the second stage is correlated to DNA helical rise.22We analysed the helical rise profiles of all transcribed genes in yeast in order to compare their average peak heights with those reported in Fig. 1A for the reference data set. In Fig. 3B, the helix rise profile of YAL053W, smoothed at 90 bp, is marked by a black solid line. In the same figure, average profiles for nucleosomes characterized by the same position number are shown. Black horizontal bars mark the nucleosome numbers, whereas red horizontal bars show the average peak height calculated for all the nucleosomes having the same number. It can be seen that the average peak height of the +1 nucleosome is larger (4.3 arbitrary units) than the heights of the following ones, in agreement with the barrier model.15In Fig. 3, average helical rise profiles for nucleosomes sharing the same position number are marked by solid red lines. As apparent from the graph, average helical rise profiles for nucleosomes at positions 0 and +1 are characterized by the lowest values. Statistical tests (non-parametric Wilcoxon–Mann–Whitney) were performed in order to asses the difference between +1 and +2 (and +3, +4, …, +7) rise value distribution (dyad rise values mediated on a window of 90 bp). P-values smaller than E-16 were computed, assessing that the distributions do no't belong to the same population, strongly rejecting the null hypothesis. It has recently been reported16,17 that, in nucleosomes assembled in vitro, the usual barrier-model pattern, with the +1 nucleosome being the most stable, is not seen. This result supports our idea that the obtained helical rise profiles are mainly correlated to the DNA sequence and can mirror in vitro occupancy. In Fig. 3C, average helical rise profiles for nucleosomes sharing the same position number (solid red line in Fig. 3B) are shown on a magnified scale and marked by a solid black line. The presence of a barrier beginning at position +2 is now clearer. Note here that the number of nucleosomes used to get the average profiles varies from 7497 (for position +1) to ~1000 (for position +15), reaching the final value of ~48 000 positioned nucleosomes instead of the 61 110 reported in the additional data file 114 and used to construct Figs 1 and 2. About half of the 7497 nucleosomes at position +1 reside on opposite strands (3758 on the Watson and 3739 on the Crick strand) and this trend is fulfilled by the following nucleosomes (at increasing position numbers) as well. As a consequence, the global nucleosome pattern must be represented as due to the presence of a mirror image of the original black profiles, as shown in Fig. 3C (pink solid line). Here the blue diamonds represent the average between peak heights belonging to black and pink profiles. The mean helical rise of the blue diamonds ranging from position +2 to position +12 shows an almost constant value of 3.175 Å, similar to the mean rise of the central peak shown in Fig. 1 (black continuous line with a smoothing window of 90 bp). The mean helical rise of the blue diamonds derived from positions 0, +1, +14 and +13 shows a value of about 3.168 Å similar to the peaks neighbouring the central one in Fig. 1. The adoption of the mirror image in Fig. 3C allowed us to interpret the shape of Fig. 1 mainly due to the contribution of the peaks that constitute the dynamic barrier as shown in Fig. 3C.3.4. Helical rise profiles of additional genomesFigure 4 presents the helical rise profiles derived from experimentally mapped nucleosome positions in D. melanogaster,28P. falciparum29 and in chromosome 20 of human genome.25 All the curves were obtained with smoothing windows of 56 bp in order to assess the presence of peaks split in two adjacent maxima as previously observed in yeast. This pattern is not evident in the helical rise profiles shown in Fig. 4, and only in the case of D. melanogaster (Fig. 4A) the presence of three peaks around the central zone of the reference dyad position may be related to the action of remodelling enzymes as previously shown and discussed in Fig. 1 in the case of yeast. The nucleosome positions mapped in yeast have been derived by six different experimental data sets and the best accuracy20 of tiled microarrays covering the entire yeast genome was extended up to a 5-bp spacing. Only one data set of nucleosome positions is still available for D. melanogaster, P. falciparum and Homo sapiens while the spacing of their tiled microarrays comprises 36, 36 and 25 bp, respectively, therefore the results shown in Fig. 4 must be considered as preliminary ones. A general conclusion is evident from the analysis of the three genomes, i.e. the preferential nucleosome occupancy occurs where the mean helical rise reaches its largest values. Probably the different shape of the three curves reflects the different organization of nucleosome near the +1 position at promoters. In yeast, the +1 nucleosome is usually found at +75 bp from TSS and in D. melanogaster this position is shifted at +135.28 In Plasmodium, near promoters are present NFRr that are devoid of nucleosomes;29 in human expressed and inexpressed genes exhibit differential positioning of nucleosome +1.24 Figure 4D shows the helical rise profiles derived by nucleosome positions in chromosome 20 of the human genome computationally mapped from the DNA sequence. Dyad positions were elaborated by Liu et al.25 either from their curvature profile method or from curves obtained according the dinucleotide frequency method of Segal et al.9 A comparison of the helical rise profile reported in Fig. 4C for the experimentally determined dyad positions of human chromosome 20 with the two computationally derived curves of Fig. 4D shows that the predictive power of the curvature profile method (black continuous line) is higher than that attainable with the dinucleotide frequency method (grey continuous line) although for the curve obtained with the curvature profile a remarkable shift of ~40 bp in the position of the central peak is observed. We are not able at the moment to explain the reason for this shift. Helical rise profiles of nucleosome positions of various genomes.

Helical rise and GC contentThe GC content of DNA sequences was found to be correlated to the intrinsic nucleosome occupancy in yeast and in Caenorhabditis elegans,30 and a high GC content was found at human regulator sequences enriched in well-positioned nucleosomes.31 Chen et al.32 reported that in C. elegans, the nucleosome-enriched regions are GC-rich when compared with the nucleosome-free sequences and, recently, the GC content has played an important role in the determinants of nucleosome organization in human cells.33 We have reanalysed the helical rise values of the 136 possible tetranucleotides reported in our previous study22 and in Fig. 5 we plot the distributions of their values as a function of the five different GC contents. At 100 and 0% GC, the distribution of the helical rise is represented with only 10 samples, the profiles are almost flat and the mean helical rises are similar, 3.13 and 3.12 Å, respectively. The profiles of the 25, 50 and 75% GC show that the mean helical rise increases with the increasing of the GC content ranging from 3.07 to 3.3 Å. The correspondence of high helical rise and GC-rich sequences may constitute a very simple explanation of why our helical rise profiles resemble maps of nucleosome occupancy currently reported in the literature and why nucleosomes are mainly found at positions where helical rise reaches its largest averaged values. Helical rise and GC content. The helical rise values of the 136 unique tetranucleotides are shown divided according to their GC content.Helical rise and GC content. The helical rise values of the 136 unique tetranucleotides are shown divided according to their GC content.4. ConclusionsWe used genomic maps of yeast nucleosome positions as primary standards to study the role of DNA helical rise in chromatin organization. Preferential positions for nucleosomes were found where the mean helical rise reaches its largest values at GC-rich DNA sequences. This result was confirmed by a preliminary survey of genomic maps of positioned nucleosomes of the D. melanogaster and P. falciparum genomes and of the human chromosome 20. We suggest that, in order to relieve the constraint imposed by the bending of the double helix, DNA regions characterized by high helical rise values are favoured when compared with shorter ones, i.e. the former do not need further stretch in order to reach their interaction points and, therefore, the stability of nucleosomes is directly correlated to the mean value of helical rise. In a previous paper,22 we reported a correlation between the stability of nucleosomes and the presence of a symmetrical distribution of distances from the nucleosomal dyad axis at specific points. The same feature is now observed in yeast helical rise profiles as a series of ‘peak’- and ‘V’-shaped curves. The difference between the two shapes resides in the lower stability of the ‘V’-shaped profiles, due to their lower helical rise values. In descending order of preference in nucleosome formation, DNA sequences characterized by the smaller helical rise values (i.e. TSS) are placed last.Preferential nucleosome occupancy was found downstream of NFRs, as observed in the barrier nucleosome model15 for statistical positioning of nucleosomes in yeast.Authors’ contributionsF.P. and D.S. equally contributed to the project, both in terms of computational analysis and drafting of the manuscript.

IntroductionIt is generally accepted that chloroplasts evolved from a photosynthetic prokaryote that entered into an endosymbiotic relationship with a non-photosynthetic host cell.1 It is also accepted that this photosynthetic prokaryote was an ancestor of the phylum Cyanobacteria.2 It is plausible, therefore, that most of the genes encoding chloroplast-localized proteins, including components of the photosynthetic machinery, are derived from this ancestral cyanobacterium.3 Cyanobacteria and chloroplasts of higher plants share common features in many biological contexts, including photosynthesis and cell division.4,5 In addition, the lipid compositions of biological membranes (photosynthetic membranes in particular) show high degrees of similarity between cyanobacteria and chloroplasts.6 Thylakoid membranes within a chloroplast are ~80% galactolipids, whereas the biological membranes of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells are generally composed of phospholipids. Monogalactosyldiacylglycerol (MGDG) is the most abundant lipid in thylakoid membranes of both cyanobacteria and higher plants. Thus, it is likely that genes encoding enzymes of the galactolipid synthetic pathways were acquired in higher plants through the endosymbiotic event.MGDG is essential for oxygenic phototrophs. Crystal structure analyses of cyanobacteria have revealed that MGDG binds to photosystem complexes, suggesting that MGDG is an important component of the photosynthetic machinery.7,8 Furthermore, in MGDG-deficient Arabidopsis thaliana, photosynthetic activity is completely absent, and development is arrested at the early seedling stage.9 Thus, MGDG is involved in both photosynthesis and chloroplast development.The pathways for MGDG synthesis in cyanobacteria and higher plants, however, are quite different.10 Higher plants utilize uridine diphosphate galactose (UDP-Gal) and diacylglycerol (DAG) to synthesize MGDG. In contrast, cyanobacteria must first synthesize monoglucosyl-DAG (MGlcDG) using UDP glucose (UDP-Glc) and DAG, which is subsequently epimerized to produce MGDG. In addition, sequence comparison indicates that MGDG synthase (MGD) genes belong to the glycosyltransferase 28 (GT28) family, whereas MGlcDG synthase (MGlcD) genes belong to the family GT2 [according to the Carbohydrate-Active Enzymes database (www.cazy.org)].11–13 In Viridiplantae (green algae and land plants), therefore, the precise origin of the pathway for MGDG synthesis is not clear.As MGDG is essential for photosynthesis, understanding the evolution of this pathway could potentially reveal important details concerning phototroph evolution in general. MGDG is found in some anoxygenic phototrophs as well as oxygenic phototrophs.14 Chloroflexi is an anoxygenic phototrophic group of bacteria whose divergence preceded that of Cyanobacteria.15–17 The MGD homolog of Chloroflexus aurantiacus, a member of the phylum Chloroflexi,18 belongs to the GT28 family and one of the encoded proteins has an MGDG producing activity.19 However, the phylogenetic relationship between these prokaryotic MGD homologs and higher plant MGDs has not been well established. Here, we performed comprehensive phylogenetic analyses on MGD homologs from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and revealed that eukaryotic MGDs including Viridiplantae, Rhodophyta, and Heterokontophyta are monophyly and probably have a single ancestor. Moreover, we found that some of Chloroflexi MGD homologs are highly associated with the eukaryotic MGDs. Analyses of the sugar specificity and anomeric configuration of the sugar head groups for three MGD homologs in Chloroflexi, Roseiflexus castenholzii,20 revealed that only one of the MGD homologs in R. castenholzii exhibits a genuine MGD activity, suggesting a possible origin of higher plant MGDs.To understand plastid evolution, it is also important to characterize MGD gene duplication. In A. thaliana, there are two types of MGD enzymes, type A (MGD1) and type B (MGD2 and MGD3).21 Type A MGDs reside in membranes of the inner envelope and, under normal circumstances, generate most MGDGs found in the chloroplast. In contrast, type B MGDs are found in membranes of the outer envelope and are involved in membrane remodeling under phosphate-starved conditions.22 MGDG synthesized in this context is converted into digalactosyl-DAG, which is used to generate cell membranes when phospholipids are not available. As type B MGDs are only found in angiosperms, this type of membrane lipid remodeling is an important characteristic of angiosperms.23–26 Under normal growth conditions, interestingly, the expression of type B MGD are low in leaves but high in floral organs.27 Thus, it is possible that the emergence of type B MGDs was an important step toward Angiospermae (angiosperm) or Spermatophyta (seed plant) evolution. Two types of MGDs are essential for plants to survive under low-phosphate conditions, and yet a detailed analysis of MGD gene divergence has not been reported. In this study, we present detailed data concerning MGD gene divergence. Our data provide a new insight into the plastid evolution based on the biogenesis of photosynthetic membranes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Phylogenetic analysesTo obtain MGD gene sequences, blastp and tblastn searches were performed against the Protein (nr), GenBank, and EST databases at the National Center for Biotechnology Information website (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), using Arabidopsis MGD amino acid sequences as queries. In addition, a blastp search was conducted against genomic data at the Department of Energy Joint Genome Institute (DOE-JGI) website (www.jgi.doe.gov/). The resulting data are listed in Supplementary Table S1.MGD amino acid sequences were aligned using MACSIMS28 and MUSCLE,29 followed by a partial manual correction. To refine these data for phylogenetic analysis, the 5'- and 3'-terminal regions of MGD gene and regions where >15% of the species had a sequence gap were eliminated from the alignment. The refined data were then subjected to phylogenetic analyses with Bayesian inference and maximum likelihood (ML). MrBayes ver 3.1.230 was used for Bayesian inference under the WAG + G4 model. Two runs with four chains of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) iterations were performed for 4 000 000 generations. Trees were sampled every 100 generations, and the first 10 000 trees (1 000 000 generations) were discarded as burn-in. Treefinder ver. October 200831 was used for ML analyses under the WAG-F + G8 model. Approximate bootstrap supports (LR-ELW; expected likelihood weights by the local rearrangement) were calculated with 10 000 replicates. RAxML ver. 7.0.432 was also used for ML analyses under the WAG-F + G4 model with 1000 bootstrap replications.To calculate the divergence time of type A and type B MGDs, the nucleotide sequences of land plant MGDs (the first and second codon positions) were subjected to Bayesian and ML phylogenetic analyses. Sequence data are listed in Supplementary Table S2. MrBayes ver 3.1.2 was used for Bayesian-tree inference with 1 000 000 generations under the GTR + G8 model. Trees were sampled every 100 generations, and the first 2500 trees (250 000 generations) were discarded as burn-in. The ML tree was estimated using RAxML ver. 7.0.4 under the GTR + G4 model with 1000 bootstrap replications. In both phylogenetic analyses, different model parameters were estimated between the first and the second codon position data. Divergence times were estimated based on the first and second codon sequences under a relaxed clock model using the MCMCTREE program in the PAML4 package.33 The model parameters were separately estimated between the first and the second codon sequences under the HKY + G5 model. The number of MCMC samples and burn-in were set to 10 000 and 2500, respectively. The following constraints were used for time calibrations (similar to Yoon et al.34): (i) divergence of vascular plants from other land plants <432 million years ago (MYA) (Kenrick and Crane35 provided the origin of land plants), (ii) divergence of seed plants from other vascular plants >355 MYA (Gillespie et al.36 provided the oldest known seeds), (iii) 290–320 MYA for the Angiospermae–Gymnospermae split, and (iv) 90–130 MYA for the Monocotyledoneae–Dicotyledoneae split.372.2. Expression of MGD homologsThe genes of three MGD homologs from R. castenholzii were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and cloned into the pET28a vector, respectively. Vectors were transformed into BL21 (DE3) competent Escherichia coli. Transformed cells were grown in Luria–Bertani medium at 37°C until they reached an OD600 reading of 0.7. Protein expression was induced using 1 mM isopropyl ß-d-thiogalactopyranoside for 3 h [we designated three genes as MGD of R. castenholzii (RcMGD), MGlcD of R. castenholzii (RcMGlcD), and diglucosyl-DAG (DGlcDG) synthase of R. castenholzii (RcDGlcD) according to their functions determined].2.3. Assay for glycolipid synthesisGlycolipid synthetic activity was assayed as described by Awai et al.13 Radiolabeled lipids were separated by one-dimensional thin-layer chromatography (TLC) in chloroform–hexane–isopropanol–tetrahydrofuran–water (50:100:80:1:2, by volume) or hexane–tetrahydrofuran–isopropanol–water (40:0.4:50:10, by volume) and detected by Image Analyzer (STORM860, Molecular Dynamics, Sunnyvale, CA, USA, or BAS2000, FUJIX).2.4. Isolation of glycolipidsCultures of E. coli expressing RcMGD, RcMGlcD, or RcDGlcD were centrifuged at 3500g for 10 min at 4°C. Pellets were homogenized in 5 ml of 50 mM TES-KOH buffer (pH 7.0) and 125 µl of 1 M MgCl2. The enzyme solutions were sonicated and mixed with 115 µl of 30 mM UDP-Gal or UDP-Glc. These mixtures were incubated at 37°C for 3 h and total lipids were extracted as described previously.38 Total lipids were then purified by column chromatography (InterSep SI, GL Sciences). Elution solvents included chloroform, acetone–isopropanol (9:1, by volume), and methanol. Glycolipids were collected in the acetone–toluene fraction and then isolated by one-dimensional TLC as above or using hexane–tetrahydrofuran–isopropanol–water (40:0.4:50:10, by volume). Finally, glycolipids were eluted using chloroform–methanol (2:1, by volume).Roseiflexus castenholzii provided from Prof. Keizo Shimada was grown as described by Yamada et al.39 Roseiflexus total lipid was also extracted as described above.38 This lipid was developed by two-dimensional TLC using chloroform–methanol–7 N ammonium hydroxide (120:80:8, by volume) in the first dimension and chloroform–methanol–acetic acid–water (170:20:15:3, by volume) in the second.2.5. Acetylation of glycolipidsThe glycolipids isolated by one-dimensional TLC were evaporated and then eluted using 0.5 ml of pyridine and 0.25 ml of acetic acid anhydride. These mixtures were incubated overnight in the dark. Subsequently, 5 ml of toluene was added to these mixtures and evaporated. This step was repeated three times. Finally, acetylated lipids were dissolved in chloroform and used for nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR).2.6. Structural analysis of glycolipids by NMRAcetylated lipids were dissolved in CDCl3. These structures were analyzed by 1H-NMR at 600 MHz (Bruker AV-600), 400 MHz (Varian 400-MR), or 270 MHz (JEOL JNM-EX-270) for protons.

Results and discussion3.1. Evolutionary relationship of MGD homologsTo comprehensively understand the relationships among MGD homologs, we compared amino acid sequences of 56 MGD homologs from prokaryotes and phototrophic eukaryotes. The homologs similarly located were excluded from the phylogenetic tree. A complete list of these proteins is shown in Supplementary Table S1. Our phylogenetic analyses identified monophyletic clades of Viridiplantae, Rhodophyta (red algae), and Heterokontophyta (heterokonts), which were clearly supported by both Bayesian inference (MrBayes) and ML analyses (Treefinder and RAxML; node A in Fig. 1). Our data provide compelling evidence that a single origin of MGD in a common ancestor of these groups and the pathway for MGDG synthesis is monophyletic among Viridiplantae, Rhodophyta, and Heterokontophyta. As indicated above, MGDs from Heterokontophyta formed a single group, suggesting that the common ancestor of Heterokontophyta acquired MGDs (node B in Fig. 1). This grouping was strongly supported by MrBayes, Treefinder, and RAxML. Notably, Rhodophyta and Heterokontophyta formed a single group (node C in Fig. 1). Recent phylogenetic analyses of plastid proteins have revealed an extremely close relationship between heterokontophytes and rhodophytes. These data suggest that heterokont plastids originated from endosymbiosis with Rhodophyta.40,41 MGDs of heterokonts were likely acquired from Rhodophyta through this endosymbiotic event.

Our phylogenetic analysis of MGDs, however, indicated that this gene formed a clade with different MGD homologs in green non-sulfur bacteria (C. aurantiacus and Chloroflexus aggregans42) (node D in Fig. 1). Since chloroplasts may be derived from ancient types of cyanobacteria, it was expected that the eukaryote MGDs may be directly evolved from a cyanobacterial MGD origin that might be acquired by the primary endosymbiotic event, although it might be lost in most cyanobacterial species. However, here, the grouping between the Gloeobacter and Chloroflexi MGD homologs was robustly supported by MrBayes, Treefinder, and RAxML (node D in Fig. 1). This result strongly suggests that the G. violaceus MGD homolog is not the origin of MGDs in Viridiplantae and that horizontal gene transfer may have occurred much more recently between Gloeobacter and Chloroflexi.However, notably, other MGD homologs of Chloroflexi strains, Chloroflexus and Roseiflexus, were located closest to the clade of chloroplasts (node E in Fig. 1). Chloroflexus au. 1, an MGD of C. aurantiacus, belongs to the GT28 family and the encoded protein has an MGDG synthetic activity.19 In addition, R. castenholzii has three MGD homologs that we have named RcMGD, RcMGlcD, and RcDGlcD according to their functions determined (see below). These genes also belong to the GT28 family, and RcMGD and RcMGlcD form a clade with Chloroflexus au. 1. Although MGD homologs from Chloroflexi and chloroplasts were closely related phylogenetically, information regarding substrate specificity was only available for Chloroflexus au. 1. We have therefore examined in more detail the enzymatic properties of Chloroflexi MGD homologs.3.2. Glycolipid synthetic activities of R. castenholzii MGD homologsTo characterize the glycolipid synthetic activities of the three R. castenholzii MGD homologs, we expressed these recombinant proteins in E. coli. When radiolabeled UDP-Gal was used as a substrate, RcMGD was capable of synthesizing a radiolabeled lipid (Fig. 2). We used UDP-Gal as a substrate because the proposed pathway for MGDG synthesis of higher plants utilizes UDP-Gal. Cucumber (Cucumis sativus) MGD1 (CsMGD) was used as a positive control for MGDG synthesis in this experiment. In contrast, RcMGD extract did not contain a radiolabeled product, when UDP-Glc was provided as a substrate, suggesting that lipid synthesis via RcMGD was UDP-Gal-dependent. On the other hand, the enzyme encoded by RcMGlcD synthesized MGlcDG when UDP-Glc was provided as a substrate. The MGlcD of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 (Sll1377) was used as a positive control for MGlcDG synthesis in this experiment. Analysis of sugar transferase activity. Radiolabeled UDP-Gal (+Gal) or UDP-Glc (+Glc) were used as substrates. The resulting lipids were separated by TLC (chloroform-hexane-tetrahydrofuran-isopropanol-water, 50:100:1:80:2 by volume) and visualized by autoradiography. CsMGD and Sll1377 (pET24b and pQE-32) were used as controls for MGDG and MGlcDG, respectively.Analysis of sugar transferase activity. Radiolabeled UDP-Gal (+Gal) or UDP-Glc (+Glc) were used as substrates. The resulting lipids were separated by TLC (chloroform-hexane-tetrahydrofuran-isopropanol-water, 50:100:1:80:2 by volume) and visualized by autoradiography. CsMGD and Sll1377 (pET24b and pQE-32) were used as controls for MGDG and MGlcDG, respectively.Using TLC, lipids from two samples (RcMGD/UDP-Gal and RcMGlcD/UDP-Glc) were purified and subjected to 1H-NMR analysis to reveal the sugar head groups of these lipids (Fig. 3). In Figs 3A and B, the doublet peak indicated by the black arrow at 4.5–4.6 ppm indicates H1 of the hexose moiety of the lipid. These peaks demonstrated that the sugar head group was bound to a glycerol backbone via a ß-anomeric configuration at the C3 position, an MGDG structure that is characteristic of land plants.14 Consequently, the clade in Fig. 1, which includes Chloroflexus and Roseiflexus, represents green non-sulfur bacterial MGDs. The present results indicate that MGD genes occur at least at the time of Chloroflexi divergence (an ancient bacterial lineage). Botté et al.43 has independently performed phylogenetic analysis of MGDs. Although they indicated similar results for phylogeny of MGDs, they have not included prokaryotic MGD homologs except for Chloroflexi in their phylogenetic analysis, and thus, the phylogenetic relationship between eukaryotic and prokaryotic MGD homologs remains uncertain. Our detailed analyses suggest that this ancestral type of MGD genes is the origin of higher plant MGDs. Analysis of glycolipids by 1H-NMR. Each glycolipid synthesized by RcMGD and RcMGlcD was analyzed by 1H-NMR at 600 MHz. (A) MGDG synthesized by RcMGD expression and (B) MGlcDG synthesized by RcMGlcD expression were isolated from E. coli.

H-1 doublet peaks (arrows) indicate that these glycolipids formed ß-anomeric configurations to the glycerol backbone.RcDGlcD synthesized a glycolipid that consisted of a number of sugars, using UDP-Glc as a substrate (Fig. 2). The crude lipid extract from E. coli overexpressing RcDGlcD contained much phospholipids derived from E. coli. To remove phospholipids and concentrate glycolipids, the extract was purified by silica column chromatography. The separated fractions were further developed by TLC and stained using the anthrone reagent (Fig. 4A). The lipid mobility was associated with DGlcDG.19 1H-NMR analysis identified this lipid as DGlcDG. The analysis showed two doublet peaks H1 and H'1 (4.4–4.6 ppm) indicating two hexose moieties in the lipid (Fig. 4B). The spectrum including these peaks revealed that this lipid contained two glucoses and these glucoses were bound to each other via a ß-anomeric configuration. Furthermore, one of these glucoses was also bound to a glycerol backbone via a ß-anomeric configuration. MGD gene homologs share a high degree of sequence similarity, yet sugar-donor specificity and the number of molecules involved in the reaction are clearly diverse. Detailed comparisons of MGD homolog sequences could potentially reveal novel protein domains that determine sugar-donor specificity. Analysis of glycolipids synthesized by RcDGlcD. Glycolipids synthesized by RcDGlcD were analyzed by TLC (A) and 1H-NMR at 400 MHz (B). (A) RcDGlcD was incubated with UDP-Glc and DAG (+sub), or without substrate (-sub). Synthesized lipids were purified by column chromatography. Fractions eluted either with chloroform (Chl), acetone-isopropanol (9:1, by volume, Ace-Iso), or methanol (Met) were developed using hexane-tetrahydrofuran-isopropanol-water (40:0.4:50:10, by volume). Glycolipids were detected by the anthrone reagent (MGDG, DGDG, and the lipid indicated by an arrow). (B) 1H-NMR lipid analysis resulted in doublet H-1 peaks (arrows), indicating ß-anomeric configurations.Analysis of glycolipids synthesized by RcDGlcD.

Subsequently, to define whether R. castenholzii possesses MGDG, MGlcDG, and DGlcDG or not, we analyzed the lipid composition of R. castenholzii. Total lipid was extracted and developed by two-dimensional TLC, and three glycolipids were detected by the anthrone reagent (Fig. 5A). We compared the mobility on two-dimensional TLC between A. thaliana and R. castenholzii (Supplementary Fig. S4). The mobility of a Roseiflexus glycolipid was very similar to Arabidopsis MGDG. Using 1H-NMR, we confirmed that this glycolipid was a galactolipid and formed a ß-anomeric configuration to the glycerol backbone (Fig. 5B). From these results, we concluded that this glycolipid is MGDG. Although the peak pattern derived from the glycerol backbone was slightly different from MGDG synthesized by RcMGD in E. coli, it is probably due to the difference in fatty acid composition of these MGDGs (Supplementary Table S3). This result strongly supports that RcMGD actually functions in vivo to synthesize MGDG. Analysis of MGDG isolated from R. castenholzii. (A) Description of 2-dimensional TLC in R. castenholzii. The TLC analysis was performed with chloroform-methanol- 7 N ammonium hydroxide (120:80:8, by volume) in the first dimension and chloroform-methanol-acetic acid-water (170:20:15:3, by volume) in the second. The lipids were visualized by spraying with primulin reagent and viewing under ultraviolet light.

The MGDG formed a ß-anomeric configuration to the glycerol backbone.As indicated above, we also detected two other glycolipids on two-dimensional TLC. One of them was assumed to be sulfoquinovosyl-DAG (SQDG) from the mobility on TLC. In fact, there is a homolog of Arabidopsis SQDG synthase 1 in Roseiflexus and the presence of SQDG in C. aurantiacus was reported in a previous paper.44 On the other hand, in another one (UL4, unknown lipid 4, in Fig. 5A), the corresponding lipid was not existent in A. thaliana. This glycolipid was likely DGlcDG. However, 1H-NMR analysis revealed that this lipid was not DGlcDG, although it consisted of at least two sugar head groups (data not shown). We could not detect MGlcDG in total lipid fraction from Roseiflexus. In Cyanobacteria, MGlcDG is a minor lipid, less than 1% of total lipid.10 Similarly, MGlcDG may not be abundant in Roseiflexus. Therefore, these results suggest that RcDGlcD mainly incorporates glucose to a major monoglycolipid MGDG, not MGlcDG in vivo.To confirm the glucose transfer activity of RcDGlcD, we used MGDG and MGlcDG as sugar acceptors and compared the diglycolipid producing activity (Fig. 6). Obviously, RcDGlcD could transfer glucose to MGDG, although DGlcDG is still produced by it's processive activity. When MGlcDG was used as a substrate, the band corresponding to DGlcDG was increased, confirming that RcDGlcD could also transfer glucose to MGlcDG. However, UL4 was not DGlcDG and MGDG is one of the most abundant lipids in Roseiflexus (Supplementary Table S3). Consequently, we presume that the main sugar acceptor of RcDGlcD in vivo is MGDG and UL4 is glycosylgalactosyl-DAG. However, since we only utilized UDP-Gal and UDP-Glc as in vitro substrates (Fig. 2), its true substrate is still uncertain, and further experiments are needed to determine the structure of UL4. Analysis of sugar transferase activity of RcDGlcD. Radiolabeled UDP-Gal (+Gal) or UDP-Glc (+Glc) were used as substrates. Additionally, MGDG or MGlcDG eluted in EtOH were added as acceptors.

GlcGalDG, glucosylgalactosyldiacylglycerol.Thylakoid membranes or membranous structures of anoxygenic photosynthetic bacteria involve complexes composed of proteins, pigments, and lipids. In particular, these types of membranes are characterized by a unique and conserved lipid composition. Genes related to the photosynthetic membrane biogenesis, therefore, have also played an important role in phototroph evolution. Recently, we reported that a distinct type of MGD belonging to the GT1 family was found in the green sulfur bacterium Chlorobacterium tepidum and proved to be involved in chlorosome biogenesis.45 This work also demonstrated that MGDG is commonly important in both anoxygenic and oxygenic photosynthetic organisms, although green sulfur and non-sulfur bacteria have independently acquired different types of MGDG synthetic machineries. Given the conservation of MGD gene families and the presence of MGDG in Chloroflexi, a functional association between the photosystem and the membrane galactolipid MGDG was established before endosymbiosis event, leading to the establishment of highly organized photosynthetic membranes.Our results suggested that the photosynthetic eukaryote has acquired MGD gene from ancestral Chloroflexi in an early event, even though Cyanobacteria has a different MGDG synthetic pathway. These pathways were subsequently conserved during the course of evolution and have played important roles in chloroplast biology. A recent large-scale phylogenetic analysis also revealed that a considerable amount of non-cyanobacterial genomic material has contributed to the establishment of the plastid before the split of red and green algae.46 Eukaryotic MGD genes may be acquired through this kind of large-scale gene transfer from ancestral Chloroflexi.3.4. The divergence point of type A and type B MGDsDetermining the time at which the two types of MGDs (type A and type B) diverged is important to understand the evolution of photosynthetic membranes in land plants. Using both Bayesian inference and ML methods, we performed phylogenetic analyses on MGD gene sequences of land plants, excluding third codon positions (Supplementary Figs S5 and S6). Results from these analyses generally agreed with accepted phylogenetic relationships of land plants. For example, Angiospermae were clearly divided into Monocotyledoneae (monocots) and Dicotyledoneae (dicots) in both types of MGDs. The groupings received strong support from both Bayesian inference and ML methods (Supplementary Figs S5 and S6). These results indicate that MGDs have been conserved throughout the course of land plant evolution. Importantly, one full-length MGD gene sequence of Picea glauca was available among Gymnospermae, and both Bayesian and ML analyses placed the Picea sequence close to the type B MGD clade. Although a Gymnospermae type A MGD has not yet been identified, this result suggests that the type A/B divergence may have preceded that of Angiospermae and Gymnospermae.Based on the phylogenetic tree, we estimated an MGD type A/B divergence time using four calibration points (similar to Yoon et al.34). Our analysis indicated that MGDs likely diverged ~323 MYA, with 298–357 MYA representing the 95% confidence interval (Fig. 7). This divergence time corresponds to the Carboniferous period, which came after Spermatophyta appeared (355–370 MYA). We propose, therefore, that the acquisition of two types of MGDs occurred in the common ancestor of Spermatophyta. The divergence time of type A and type B MGDs.

DE, Devonian; CA, Carboniferous; PE, Permian; TR, Triassic; JU, Jurassic; CR, Cretaceous; CE, Cenozoic.Our data indicate that MGD gene duplication and subsequent functional differentiation occurred in Spermatophyta (Fig. 8). Jiao et al.47 showed that a whole-genome duplication (WGD) event occurred in the common ancestor of all seed plants. This WGD allowed for major adaptive changes in these organisms and contributed to the dominance of seed plants. Interestingly, type B MGD expression is elevated during the reproduction stage of seed plants.27 During the Carboniferous period, spore-producing plants were dominant,48 whereas this dominance shifted to seed plants shortly thereafter. The Carboniferous and Permian periods were also characterized by dramatic changes to the global climate, primarily drying. Expression of type B MGDs is elevated during phosphate deprivation, a response that is regulated by both auxin and cytokinin.49 These regulatory mechanisms may have worked in response to these climate changes. More extensive research concerning the MGDs of Gymnospermae is required for a thorough understanding of MGD gene evolution. It is important to determine whether there is a species of Gymnospermae that has two types of MGDs. The evolution of Gymnospermae, however, has not been adequately mapped, in part because a complete genome sequence is not available. Determining the divergence time of type A and B MGDs in Gymnospermae may prove critical if we are to understand the divergence of land plants. Proposed model for MGD evolution.

ConclusionBased on phylogenetic and enzymatic analyses, we proposed the evolutionary model of MGDs (Fig. 8). Although no cyanobacteria analyzed possessed the ancestral type of higher plant MGDs, we identified the possible MGD ancestor from Chloroflexi. The results suggest that higher plant MGD originated from this type of Chloroflexi MGD. Eukaryotic MGD may be acquired from ancient Chloroflexi via horizontal gene transfer in parallel with the major endosymbiotic event and contributed to the early plastid evolution. After the acquirement, MGD duplication and functional differentiation of two types of MGD, types A and B, occurred along with land plant evolution. This functional differentiation probably had important meanings in further prosperity of seed plants. It is universally accepted that an ancestral cyanobacterium is the origin of the plastid organelle; however, plastid evolution is still heavily debated. These disagreements can be attributed to a very complex process that involved both horizontal and intracellular gene transfer during the course of prokaryotic and eukaryotic evolution.50,51 To generate a more accurate picture of photosynthesis evolution, we believe that focused comprehensive analyses of specific physiological processes are just as important as more global gene sequence comparisons. In particular, galactolipids are highly enriched in photosynthetic membranes, and deciphering the evolution of galactolipid synthetic pathways provides critical information toward understanding the early evolution of photosynthesis.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the Global Center of Excellence Program, from the Earth to ‘Earths’, at the Tokyo Institute of Technology and The University of Tokyo.We would like to thank Dr Robert P.

IntroductionThe genus Mycoplasma, composed of bacteria that have no cell wall and have extremely reduced genomes, includes several species of medical or veterinary significance. Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae is an important swine pathogen, causing worldwide economic losses in the livestock industry.1 In recent years, many Mycoplasma species have had their genomes completely sequenced, including four strains of M. hyopneumoniae.2–4 Their genomes are ~900 kb in length and contain ~700 genes.The analysis of genomic data shows that Mycoplasma genomes contain a small number of genes related to transcription. In the Clusters of Ortholog Groups (COG) classification, there are 20 genes implicated in this process in M. hyopneumoniae strain 7448, corresponding to ~3% of the total coding sequences (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/coxik.cgi?gi=18652). Comparatively, 353 transcription-related genes are found in Bacillus subtilis, accounting for 7.4% of the total CDSs (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sutils/coxik.cgi?gi=27).Like other Mycoplasma species, M. hyopneumoniae lacks many regulatory elements, including two-component systems and the transcription termination factor Rho.5 Furthermore, only a single s factor has been identified in all the Mycoplasma genomes analysed, while Escherichia coli has at least six s factors6 and B. subtilis has at least 18.7 These observations suggest that mycoplasmas have transcriptional regulatory mechanisms that are unique among bacterial species.The identification of promoter sequences is an important step towards understanding gene regulation; however, there are few studies about the nucleotide sequences that control transcriptional initiation in Mycoplasma. A fundamental study was published more than 10 years ago by Weiner et al.,8 in which several putative Mycoplasma pneumoniae promoters were identified by primer extension coupled with analysis using E. coli s70 matrices. The defined sequences were used to derive an improved matrix for promoter prediction in this species.In M. hyopneumoniae, very few promoters or transcriptional start sites (TSSs) have been determined. Therefore, with the goal of investigating M. hyopneumoniae promoters, 23 gene TSSs were mapped, and their adjacent upstream regions were examined for overrepresented sequences. The data gathered were then used to build species-specific position-specific scoring matrices (PSSMs), which were further evaluated in relation to their predictive performance. The best PSSM was utilized to scan for putative promoters upstream of all coding sequences of the M. hyopneumoniae genome.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains and culture conditionsMycoplasma hyopneumoniae strain 7448 was cultured in 15-ml Falcon tubes containing 5 ml of Friis medium9 at 37°C for ~48 h with gentle agitation in a roller drum. Escherichia coli XL1-Blue was cultured at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium, which was supplemented with 100 µg/ml of ampicillin when required. For blue/white colony selection, 40 µg/ml of X-gal (5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-ß-d-galacto-pyranoside) and 0.3 mM isopropyl-ß-d-thiogalactopyranoside were added to the LB agar.102.2. DNA manipulations, oligonucleotides and sequence analysisDNA purifications from agarose gel bands were performed with the NucleoSpin® Extract II kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG, Düren, Germany) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The SmaI-digested plasmid pUC18 was utilized in cloning procedures. DNA ligation, transformation by electroporation, colony polymerase chain reaction (PCR), plasmid extraction and agarose gel electrophoresis were performed using standard methods.10 The 5' RACE adapter, the primers 5' rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) Outer and 5' RACE Inner were provided in the First Choice RNA ligase-mediated (RLM)-RACE kit (Ambion, Inc., Austin, TX, USA). Gene-specific primers employed in the 5' RLM-RACE analysis are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The primers M13 forward and M13 reverse (Invitrogen™, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were utilized in the screening of clones and in the sequencing reactions. Sequencing was performed using the Dyenamic et dye terminator cycle sequencing kit (Healthcare, Waukesha, WI, USA) and a MegaBACE 1000 DNA Analysis System automated sequencer (Healthcare).2.3. RNA isolationTotal RNA was isolated from a 25 ml culture of M. hyopneumoniae strain 7448. Cells were harvested by centrifugation at 3360 × g for 15 min and resuspended in 1 ml of TRIzol (Invitrogen). The cell suspension was then processed according to the manufacturer's protocol. Subsequently, 50 µg of RNA was treated with RQ1 RNase-Free DNase (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA), followed by purification and concentration with the NucleoSpin® RNA Clean-up XS kit (Macherey-Nagel GmbH & Co. KG).2.4. 5' RLM-RACETo identify TSSs, the strategy described by Bensing et al.11 was employed. This methodology was performed using the First Choice RLM-RACE kit (Ambion, Inc.) following the manufacturer's protocol, except that the calf intestinal phosphatase treatment was not carried out. Briefly, a 16 µl of reaction mixture containing 10 µg of DNA-free RNA, tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) buffer and 20 U RNase Inhibitor (Fermentas) was divided into two aliquots, one of which received 2 µl of TAP enzyme (TAP+ reaction) and the other an equal volume of water (TAP- reaction). After TAP treatment, both samples were processed identically in the 5' RACE adapter ligation and reverse transcription steps. Once cDNA was obtained, three nested PCRs were carried out for each gene: TAP+, TAP- and the negative control. All the reactions were performed in a total volume of 25 µl containing 1.25 mM MgCl2, 1× Taq buffer, 0.02 mM of each deoxynucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (Ludwig Biotec, Porto Alegre, Brazil), 10 pmol of the gene- and adaptor-specific primers and 0.5 µl of the template. The outer 5' RLM-RACE PCR was done with cDNA as the template, the 5' RACE outer primer and the gene-specific outer primer. The inner 5' RLM-RACE PCR was done using an aliquot of the outer 5' RLM-RACE PCR as the template, the 5' RACE inner primer and the gene-specific inner primer. Amplifications were performed using the touchdown technique, and the products were analysed in 1.2–2% agarose gels. Differential DNA gel bands present in the TAP-treated samples (fragments derived from unprocessed RNA), but not in the TAP-untreated samples, were purified and cloned. Clones were screened by colony PCR for the presence of the insert and then sequenced.2.5. Sequence logosSequence logos were created using the WebLogo site (http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/).12,13 Experimentally defined s70 promoter sequences of different bacteria were utilized, relying on the alignments proposed by the respective authors (Supplementary Table S2). The following numbers of promoter sequences were used to generate the logos: 25 sites of Sinorhizobium meliloti,14 59 sites of E. coli,15 142 sites of B. subtilis,16 41 sites of Chlamydia trachomatis,17 35 sites of M. pneumoniae,8 25 sites of Prochlorococcus marinus,18 21 sites of Campylobacter jejuni19 and 23 sites of M. hyopneumoniae. Genome size and G + C content were obtained from the genomes deposited in the National Center of Biotechnology Information database (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).2.6. PSSMs constructionThe 5' regions of the TSSs determined by RLM-RACE were examined for sequence patterns using the Local-Word-Analysis tool20 from Regulatory Sequence Analysis Tools21,22 (RSAT) (http://rsat.ulb.ac.be/). The first 50 bases upstream of the TSSs were analysed, searching for motifs composed of six or four nucleotides, applying a window with a fixed width of 10 nts (for motifs of 6 nts) and a fixed width of 5 nts (for motifs of 4 nts), and a background model that considered all upstream regions of the M. hyopneumoniae strain 7448 genes, preventing overlap with upstream open reading frames (ORFs). Overrepresented motifs located four to eight bases upstream of the TSS were manually aligned with BioEdit 7.0,23 and this alignment was used to build a weight matrix of 12 columns. In addition, other two matrices of 14 and 16 columns were derived using the matrix-building programs MEME24 and Wconsensus25 (http://ural.wustl.edu/consensus/), respectively. For building these matrices, 25 bases upstream of the TSSs were analysed with an undefined motif width and the Bernoulli model as the background. In order to mitigate the overfitting problem, the matrices were rebuilt eliminating repeated sites.2.7. Data setAll analyses were carried out with the sequences obtained from the complete genome of M. hyopneumoniae strain 7448, available at NCBI under the accession code NC_007332. The data sets used for both Matrix-Quality and Matrix-Scan procedures were extracted from all the M. hyopneumoniae protein-coding genes using the Retrieve Sequence tool from RSAT. The 657 extracted sequences consisted of up to 250 bases upstream (without overlap with the upstream open reading frame) and 50 bases downstream of the annotated start.2.8. PSSMs performance evaluationThe ability of each of the three PSSMs to discover functional binding sites in the data set sequences was evaluated using the Matrix-Quality26 program from RSAT.The following parameters were applied: one pseudo-count was used for correction of the matrix; pseudo-frequencies were set at 0.01. As background, Markov orders from 0 to 4 were tested using the whole set of upstream noncoding sequences of the M. hyopneumoniae strain 7448 genome. Comparative analyses of the normalized weight distribution (NWD) curves, obtained from Matrix-Quality, were carried out to decide which matrix and Markov order to use. The trade-off between the estimation of the false-positive rate (FPR) and the sensitivity of the matrix was assessed using receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves, containing a leave-one-out (LOO) evaluation of the positive set (sequences used to build the matrix). Finally, as an additional negative control, the empirical and theoretical distributions of the original matrix were compared with the average of 10 column-permuted PSSMs, which were obtained with the Permute-Matrix tool from RSAT.2.9. Prediction of promotersThe putative M. hyopneumoniae promoters were identified using the 12-column weight matrix on the sequence data set through the Matrix-Scan program.27 The parameters were set as in Matrix-Quality, except that the Markov order was set at 1. The score threshold was determined by comparing the score distribution between the predicted promoters from the sequence data set (correct orientation) with those found in the reverse complement of the sequence data set (incorrect orientation). This analysis excluded intergenic sequences present between genes that are transcribed in divergent directions. The score that resulted in a considerable reduction in putative promoters in the incorrect orientation was selected as the threshold value.3. Results3.1. Mapping of TSSsInitially, the genes for the study of M. hyopneumoniae promoters were chosen based on two criteria: (i) genes annotated as hypothetical were excluded, since it was not known whether they were transcribed and (ii) genes chosen had a divergent upstream gene, thus ensuring that they did not lie inside an operon, and that, consequently, there was a promoter immediately upstream of them. About a quarter of the 79 genes that met these criteria were selected (Supplementary Table S3). The mapping of the TSSs was performed using the 5' RLM-RACE technique, which allows distinction between primary and processed transcripts on the basis of the phosphorylation state of their 5' ends. In this process, based on the comparison of 5' RLM-RACE products derived from RNA treated with TAP and from untreated RNA, it is possible to identify full-length transcripts, since TAP-treated samples include both primary and processed transcripts, while untreated samples include only the processed ones. Thus, the amplification products from TAP-treated RNA samples contained a specific or at least an enhanced signal from primary transcripts compared with untreated RNA samples. Amplification products derived from the 5' ends of intact transcripts were cloned and sequenced (Supplementary Table S4).The analysis of 10 or more independent clones for each gene revealed that, in many cases, the 5' end of the transcripts varied by a few nucleotides in length. In general, the longest sequence was the most common among the clones sequenced. One or two shorter sequences, differing by no more than six nucleotides, were also relatively frequent in eight genes (Supplementary Table S4). These could represent alternative TSSs or could have originated from processed transcripts that were co-purified with the primary ones, since both are present in the TAP-treated samples and may have small length differences. Given the latter assumption, the 5' nucleotide of the largest sequence of each gene was considered to be the TSS.Five genes (sips, P97-like, pgk, pyrH and ktrA) had additional nucleotides at the 5' end of their transcripts that were not expected from the genomic sequence (data not shown). The extra nucleotides consisted of one to six adenosines within a homopolymeric region composed of at least three adenosines. In these cases, the last 5' templated nucleotide was considered to be the TSS.Overall, the TSSs for 23 M. hyopneumoniae genes were identified (Table 1). Four TSSs were found inside of their respective genes: 34 bp within licA, 14 bp within gyrA and 1 bp within MHP7448_0279 and dam. In these cases, the next in-frame start codon downstream of the TSS was assumed to be the true start codon. The distances between TSSs and the gene starts ranged from 143 bp in MHP7448_0360 to 1 bp in ktrA. The genes rplJ and MHP7448_0198 also had distant TSSs, 100 and 137 bp from their start codons, respectively, while the TSSs of licA, glyA, MHP7448_0279 and leuS were situated <10 bp from their start codons. Further analysis found that 80% of the transcripts initiated with an adenosine residue.

Identification of promoter elementsThe 23 experimentally determined TSSs were aligned and the sequences immediately 5' to them were examined for nucleotide patterns that could comprise promoter elements. The occurrence of locally overrepresented sequences was detected using the Local-Word-Analysis tool. When looking for motifs of six nucleotides, 21 of the 23 genes had the patterns TATAAT or TAAAAT within 5–8 nts of the TSS (Table 1). Additional variants were found in the remaining two genes with multiple em for motif elicitation (MEME) and Wconsensus, which recognized the motifs AAAAAT and TACAAT in the recA and ktrA genes, respectively (Table 1). Four nucleotide positions of these hexamers were invariant. However, thymidine was the first base in 22 (96%) and the third base in 16 (70%) of them. Therefore, the consensus sequence was TATAAT, which is identical to the canonical s70 promoter -10 element.15The alignment of the sequences using the -10 hexamers revealed additional conserved elements. The base immediately 3' of the -10 hexamer was thymine in 73% of the sequences (Table 1). Moreover, there was considerable conservation in the bases upstream of the -10 element. The Local-Word-Analysis software found the pattern TATG in eight of the genes, one nucleotide upstream of the -10 element (Table 1). This motif matches the consensus 5'-TRTGn-3', an extended -10 region commonly found in Gram-positive bacteria that is also known as the -16 element.28,29 In addition, the dinucleotide TG (the major determinant of -10 extended elements) was found one base upstream of the -10 hexamer in another three genes, so 11 (48%) promoter sequences contained a probable extended -10 element.While it was possible identify the putative -10 and -16 elements, no conserved pattern corresponding to a -35 element was found (Table 1). Instead, a periodic AT-rich sequence was seen when a sequence logo was created (Fig. 1). Sequence conservation in the M. hyopneumoniae promoter region. Sequence logo derived from the alignment of the 23 defined promoter regions showing the high conservation of the -10 element (positions 59–64), the presence of a semi-conserved -16 element (positions 54–57), the absence of a -35 element and the distinct periodic AT-rich signal extending upstream of the -10 element. The region extending between positions 54 and 65 was used to construct the 12-column PSSM. The vertical axis shows information content in bits. The overall height of the stack indicates the sequence conservation at that position, whereas the height of the nucleotide within the stack indicates its relative frequency at that position.Sequence conservation in the M. hyopneumoniae promoter region.

Comparison with other s70 bacterial consensus sequencesMycoplasma hyopneumoniae promoter sequences were compared with other s70 promoters from different microorganisms. The alignments of experimentally identified sequences were retrieved to create logos, which visually represent sequence conservation.The results presented in Fig. 2 suggest that the occurrence of -35 elements in the s70 promoter is related to the G + C content of the organism. The promoters of the species S. meliloti, E. coli, B. subtilis, C. trachomatis and M. pneumoniae, which have a genomic G + C content =40%, have the trinucleotide TTG of the -35 element, whereas the promoters of P. marinus, C. jejuni and M. hyopneumoniae, which have a genomic G + C content =30.8%, do not have this conserved trinucleotide. s70-like recognition sites in different bacterial species.

One noteworthy observation was that this element was preceded by the dinucleotide TG, a feature that is shared with B. subtilis and C. jejuni, indicating the existence of a -16 element. Another distinct characteristic found was the presence of periodic AT-rich sequences upstream of the -10 elements of M. hyopneumoniae and C. jejuni.3.4. Construction of a PSSM for prediction of M. hyopneumoniae promotersManual alignment of the 23 defined M. hyopneumoniae promoters was used to create a PSSM of 12 columns (Tables 1 and 2). In order to validate whether this alignment and the positions included in the matrix were appropriate, two other matrices were independently constructed using MEME and the Wconsensus. Both programs included the same 12 positions used in the initial matrix to build their matrices. However, these latter matrices included a few more positions, generating PSSMs of 14 and 16 columns (Table 1). PSSM based on experimentally determined M. hyopneumoniae promotersPSSM based on experimentally determined M. hyopneumoniae promotersOnce the three PSSMs were obtained, they were rebuilt, excluding the repeated sites, with the aim of minimizing the problem of overfitting, and then their predictive capacity was assessed and compared in order to choose the best one. Matrix-Quality was used to perform this evaluation. This program relies on a combined analysis of theoretical and empirical score distributions to estimate the capability of a PSSM to distinguish putative binding sites from the genomic background.26 The theoretical distribution encompasses the matrix scores along a random sequence of infinite length generated using the background model. This indicates the probability of a site scoring above a given weight score by chance, and thus provides an estimate of the FPR.26 The empirical distribution contains the matrix scores obtained along the sequences of interest (e.g. upstream noncoding sequences), which are composed predominantly of nonbinding sites, interspersed with a few biologically functional sites.26 Both distributions were calculated using the three PSSMs. For the empirical distribution, the sequence set comprised up to 250 bases upstream and 50 bases downstream of the start codon from all M. hyopneumoniae protein-coding genes (downstream bases were also scanned because some TSSs were found within genes). As a background model, the whole set of the upstream noncoding sequences of the M. hyopneumoniae genome was used, testing different Markov orders (0–4), since this affects the weight score computation and, consequently, the performance of the matrices. The discriminatory capability of each matrix coupled with each Markov order was assessed by comparison of the empirical and theoretical score distributions.The difference between the two distributions indicates the discriminative power of the matrix, which can be expressed by computation of the NWD curves.26 In this analysis, the weight score difference (WD) between the weight scores observed in empirical and theoretical distributions is calculated at each frequency value. As larger matrices allow higher scores, the WD is divided by the number of matrix columns to obtain the NWD, which allows that matrices of different lengths to be compared. All matrices performed better using a Markov order of 1 (Supplementary Fig. S1). Comparison of these matrices using this background model showed that the matrix of 12 columns yielded the highest NWD values (Fig. 3), indicating that this PSSM was the best one to discriminate putative promoter sequences from the noncoding genomic background. Performances of the 12-, 14- and 16-column PSSMs using a Markov order of 1 as the background model. Each curve shows the normalized weight score difference (NWD) calculated from theoretical and empirical distributions obtained for each matrix using a Markov order of 1.

Each curve shows the normalized weight score difference (NWD) calculated from theoretical and empirical distributions obtained for each matrix using a Markov order of 1. The higher the NWD value, the better the matrix distinguished putative sites from the noncoding genomic background.Once the PSSM and the background model were defined, additional analyses were performed. In order to generate a complementary negative control, the same data set used for the empirical distribution was scanned using column-permuted matrices derived from the 12-column PSSM. Figure 4 shows that the mean of the score distributions of 10 permuted matrices overlapped the theoretical distribution. This confirmed that the theoretical distribution can be considered an appropriate estimate of the FPR, and that the divergence observed in the original PSSM distribution corresponded to sites specifically detected by this matrix in the genome.26Weight score distributions for the 12-column PSSM. The curves of the theoretical (black; dashed-dotted line) and empirical (orange; dashed line) distributions obtained with the 12-column PSSM began to separate at a weight score of 3, indicating that the promoters were being distinguished from the genomic background. Note that the mean of the score distributions of 10 column-permuted matrices (blue; solid line) overlaps with the theoretical distribution, confirming that the theoretical distribution can be considered an appropriate estimation of the FPR. The theoretical score distribution was estimated with a Markov model of order 1 using the whole set of upstream noncoding sequences of M. hyopneumoniae. The empirical score distribution was obtained with a sequence set composed of the 250 bases upstream and 50 bases downstream of the start codon of all M. hyopneumoniae protein-coding genes. The dCDF (ordinate) indicates the probability of observing a site scoring higher than or equal to a given weight score (abscissa).Weight score distributions for the 12-column PSSM.

Score threshold determinationThe curves of the theoretical and empirical distributions of the 12-column PSSM began to separate from each other around a weight score of 3 (Fig. 4), which is probably indicative of the presence of functional binding sites. At this score value, the decreasing cumulative distribution function (dCDF, indicates the P-value, i.e. the probability to obtain by chance a weight score higher than or equal to a given value) in theoretical distribution is 4.1 × 10-3 (3.86 × 10-3 in the permuted matrix distribution) and in the empirical distribution is 5.8 × 10-3. It means that for ~6 sites found in the upstream gene sequences, one could expect that ~4 of those were false-positives. Hence, the incidence of false-positives in relation to the observed frequency of sites in the target sequences is too high at this point. However, from a score of 3 upwards, the difference between the observed and the expected frequencies gradually increased (Fig. 4). Consequently, the choice of a score threshold that would allow comprehensive promoter identification with a relatively low FPR was necessary.The threshold score was defined using the complementary approach described by Cases et al.30 This procedure compares the score distributions of predicted promoters that are ‘correctly’ oriented – that are in the same direction as the downstream gene – with those found in the reverse strand, which are, therefore, ‘incorrectly’ oriented. The assumption is that false-positives should be homogeneously distributed between both strands, whereas true positives must be correctly oriented.30The target sequences were composed of those from the dataset used for the determination of the empirical distribution, but the sequences located between divergent genes were excluded, as they could have had promoters in both directions. The occurrence of putative promoters in these sequences and their respective reverse complements was determined by Matrix-Scan using the 12-column PSSM and a Markov order of 1 as the background model. The distributions of the correctly and incorrectly oriented promoters are presented in Fig. 5. The incidence of incorrectly oriented promoters considerably diminished with a weight score of 6.5, so this was used as the threshold score for posterior analyses. The estimated FPR at this score was 2.4 × 10-4 (2 × 10-4 in the permuted matrices distribution), whereas the dCDF in the empirical distribution was 1.42 × 10-3. Weight score threshold definition.

Distribution of the scores of the correctly and incorrectly oriented promoters predicted in the M. hyopneumoniae intergenic regions. Note that from score 6.5, the frequencies of incorrectly oriented promoters are much smaller than the frequencies of correctly oriented promoters.The trade-off between the FPR and the sensitivity of the threshold score was assessed using the ROC curve generated by Matrix-Quality analysis (Fig. 6). The sensitivity of a PSSM is the proportion of correct sites detected above the score threshold, and it is estimated by scoring the sites used to build the matrix.26 This estimation was also performed using the LOO validation, which corrects biases in matrix sensitivity.26 Figure 6 shows that a FPR of 2.4 × 10-4 (at a score of 6.5) is associated with a sensitivity of 0.65 for the biased curve, and 0.60 for the LOO curve. It is worth noting that the LOO curve and the unbiased curve are not distant from each other, so overfitting was insignificant. Trade-off between the sensitivity and FPR of the 12-column PSSM.

Predicted promotersAfter the optimum matrix parameters were defined, the upstream sequences of all 657 M. hyopneumoniae CDSs were scanned for the presence of putative promoters using Matrix-Scan. Table 3 shows the general results of this analysis. Using a threshold score of 6.5, 201 sites were identified upstream of 169 different genes, 26% of the total CDSs. Mycoplasma hyopneumoniae promoter prediction analysisMycoplasma hyopneumoniae promoter prediction analysisThe vast majority of the CDSs had a single putative promoter, although there were CDSs that had additional sites. In this promoter prediction analysis, 16 of the 23 promoters experimentally mapped scored between 6.9 and 11, six scored between 4.2 and 6.3, and one, the recA promoter, did not score above zero. Most of them corresponded to the hit with the highest score, but those of the genes uvrC, MHP7448_0198 and ktrA were the second best hits (although none of these scored higher than 6.5).Our analyses detected at least one promoter in 54% of the CDSs that had a divergent upstream gene and in 18% of the CDSs that had an upstream gene oriented in the same direction. However, these proportions were 80 and 31%, respectively, if the threshold score was set at 4.2, the smallest weight score obtained for the experimentally defined promoters.The distance of the promoters from the start codon was also examined. The majority of the predicted promoters, ~67.5%, were located between 1 and 100 bases upstream of the start codon, with a preponderance located 25–50 bases upstream (Fig. 7). Sixteen promoters were found within the coding sequences of 14 CDSs. Distance of the predicted promoters from the annotated start codon of the M. hyopneumoniae CDSs.

DiscussionThe transcripts of 23 genes of M. hyopneumoniae were analysed in order to map their TSSs. As is usually the case in transcripts of other bacteria,8,15,16,18 most of those from M. hyopneumoniae started with a purine. Our data also showed that many of its gene transcripts had variation at their 5' ends, suggesting the occurrence of heterogeneous TSSs. The heterogeneity observed in some M. hyopneumoniae transcripts was due to additional untemplated nucleotides (i.e. nucleotides not expected from the genome sequence), and was probably the result of transcriptional slippage.31 In this process, the RNA polymerase adds nucleotides, repetitively, to the 3' end of the nascent transcript, typically within homopolymeric sequences. Differently, the 5' end of some transcripts had length differences in which the additional nucleotides were identical to the genomic sequence. Such templated heterogeneous 5' ends have also been seen frequently in the M. pneumoniae transcripts.8In addition, a high frequency of transcripts that have just few nucleotides in their 5' untranslated region, reported in M. pneumoniae,8 was also seen in M. hyopneumoniae. Translation can be initiated on the leaderless mRNAs in the three domains of life, but, although they are abundant in Archaea, they are still considered rare in bacteria. Thus, as mentioned by Weiner et al.,8 this high incidence of leaderless transcripts in Mycoplasma could be a result of adaptation to a minimal genome with the aim of reducing the genomic space required for initiation of translation.The only s factor identified in the M. hyopneumoniae genome belongs to the s70 protein family. The s70 factors interact with archetypical promoters that are composed of two main regions: the -35 element (TTGACA) and the -10 element (TATAAT). The upstream regions of experimentally defined TSSs of the M. hyopneumoniae genes contained a -10 element, but no obvious -35 element, a structure shared with other low G + C content bacteria.19 It has been suggested that organisms that have undergone massive reductions in their genome acquired a low G + C content and have also had degradation of their regulatory signals.32Previous studies have demonstrated that transcription can occur when only the -10 element is present, although additional elements, including activator proteins and extended -10 elements (the -16 element), may be involved.32 Forty-eight per cent of the experimentally characterized M. hyopneumoniae promoters contained the -16 element. This proportion is very similar to that found in B. subtilis, in which ~45% of promoters possess this element.33 Studies suggest that the extended elements compensate for the lack of conservation in the -10 and -35 boxes of the promoters.34 The -16 elements are also found in promoters of other species, including E. coli and C. jejuni, but are not seen in M. pneumoniae promoters.8,35The AT-rich stretches upstream of the -10 element in the promoters of M. hyopneumoniae and C. jejuni may result in transcriptional enhancement. Petersen et al.36 suggested that they could play a role as specific binding sites or be implicated in DNA curvature. These stretches could also be related to upstream (UP) elements, which can affect promoter recognition and activity.37 UP elements are AT-rich sequences, typically located in a region from nt -40 to nt -60 (relative to the TSS) that interacts with the C-terminal domain of the a-subunits of RNA polymerase.37 They have been identified in several bacterial species, and their occurrence increases as the genomic G + C content of the organisms decreases.38 UP elements can improve the activity of a TGn/-10 promoter in the absence of a good -35 element,39 and promoters comprising only UP and -10 elements can be recognized by RNA polymerase.40 Thus, in AT-rich organisms, such as M. hyopneumoniae, it is likely that the AT-rich stretches act as UP elements, which may lessen the requirement for -35 hexamers.While the conservation of the -10 element in both Mycoplasma species is evident, the M. hyopneumoniae promoters are particularly similar to those of C. jejuni. Besides lacking the -35 signal and possessing the extended -10 element, they also have periodic AT-rich stretches upstream of the -10 region. Since M. hyopneumoniae (Tenericutes) and C. jejuni (Proteobacteria) are phylogenetically distant, their promoter similarities suggest evolutionary convergence, which could be consequence of their high genomic A + T content (~70%).PSSMs have been widely used to find conserved motifs.27 A PSSM was defined based on the experimentally defined promoters in order to detect promoter-like sequences along the intergenic regions of the M. hyopneumoniae genome.The promoter scan of M. hyopneumoniae sequences found that the pattern detected by the matrix occurred more frequently than expected, indicating that it did not occur by chance and that it was probably functional in initiating gene transcription. Recent studies based on E. coli s70 promoter data were not able to detect these patterns in Mycoplasma genomes,32,41 even suggesting that the existence of promoters in these bacteria was debatable.41 However, as demonstrated by Weiner et al.,8 the identification of Mycoplasma promoters using an E. coli matrix is not efficient. Our study has improved on these previous studies by using a species-specific PSSM that accounted for the variability between bacterial species, avoiding biases that might result from using heterologous PSSMs.Approximately 26% of the CDSs in the M. hyopneumoniae genome had at least one identifiable promoter in their upstream region. However, many of the upstream sequences of the CDSs were too short to contain a promoter sequence of 12 nucleotides and a spacer of four nucleotides preceding the TSS. Therefore, the coverage of CDSs that could contain a promoter was greater than estimated. Adams et al.42 have suggested that the upper limits of the intergenic regions in the M. hyopneumoniae operons is ~50 bases, and studies have shown that genes that are organized in tandem with intergenic distances much larger than 50 bases can be transcribed in large transcriptional units.43 These findings indicate that many CDSs are regulated by common promoters, and therefore that not all CDSs necessarily have a promoter in their adjacent upstream regions.Intergenic regions between divergently oriented genes are the most probable sites to find promoter-like sequences. Our analyses indicated that 54% of the genes with this organization had at least one promoter signal. In contrast, of the 515 genes oriented in tandem, only 93 (18%) had a promoter sequence upstream. The relatively small proportion of in tandem CDSs that possessed promoters was probably attributable to the organization of most of these genes in transcriptional units and, therefore, their transcription might be driven by promoters that are not in the nearest upstream intergenic region.Although experimental studies have detected the presence of large transcripts in M. hyopneumoniae, which could be transcribed from the promoter upstream of the first CDS of the transcriptional unit, our study demonstrates that many internal CDSs may also contain putative promoters. For instance, in the experimentally defined transcriptional unit containing the genes deoC, upp, MHP7448_0525, lon and tuf,44 all the genes, except MHP7448_0525, contain promoter sequences in their upstream regions (with scores varying from 8.4 to 11) (data not shown). This example corroborates the findings of Gardner et al.,43 who demonstrated that, even when transcription does not cease between genes, there is evidence of independent transcriptional initiation by the promoter of the following gene.Most of the CDSs had a single promoter sequence (84%), but CDSs with multiple promoter sequences were also detected. The tuf gene, for example, which is known to be highly expressed, possessed three promoters in its upstream region, two of which overlapped (data not shown). Overlapping signals could promote transcription by recruiting RNA polymerases to the primary promoter sequence.45 In the absence of a strong promoter, overlapping sites could be noncompetitive weak promoters that could produce basal transcription of the downstream genes. On the other hand, they could also negatively regulate transcription through competition between RNA polymerases,46 or through the induction of a pause in the early steps in elongation.47,48The majority of the putative promoters were found between 1 and 100 bases upstream of the start codon. This is congruent with many previous studies performed in different bacterial species.36 Some predicted promoter sequences were found within CDSs. This could be because the start codons of these genes were not assigned correctly, or because these putative intragenic signals have an unknown regulatory function.Although a comprehensive prediction of promoters was performed in this study, many putative signals were not detected using the criteria used for prediction. The main restraint was the threshold score of 6.5. Approximately 30% of the promoters defined experimentally in our study were not detected using this cut-off value. Even the recA promoter was not detected using these criteria. The lowest score for the experimentally defined promoters was 4.2; however, at this threshold, about half of the sequences identified were estimated to be false-positives. There are many promoter-like sequences in the genome with scores >4.2 (dCDF = 3.46 × 10-3), raising the question of how RNA polymerase distinguishes the signals of true promoters from the false-positives. As M. hyopneumoniae only has a small number of known regulatory proteins,2 one might speculate that most of the sequences that score >4.2 are true promoters. Gardner et al.43 found that there is transcription across the majority of the intergenic regions in M. hyopneumoniae. However, studies have demonstrated that this species is able to control transcription;49–53 therefore, the sequence contexts in which the signals are immersed may be a determinant of transcriptional initiation.In summary, our study has contributed to understanding of transcriptional regulation in M. hyopneumoniae, as it has identified basic elements involved in transcriptional initiation and verified their distribution in the upstream regions of protein-coding genes in this species. Possible applications for the PSSM defined in this study would be refinement of genome annotations and investigation of promoters in closely related species, such as Mycoplasma hyorhinis and Mycoplasma flocculare.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by grants from the Brazilian National Research Council, the Fundação de Amparo à Pesquisa do Rio Grande do Sul and the Coordenação de Aperfeiçoamento de Pessoal de Nível Superior.We especially thank Professor Augusto Schrank for valuable suggestions and Alejandra Medina-Rivera for all support with the Matrix-Quality program.

Our draft genome of the pearl oyster thus provides a platform for the identification of selection markers and genes for calcification, knowledge of which will be important in the pearl industry.1. IntroductionWe sequenced the genome of the pearl oyster Pinctada fucata (Fig. 1A) with two major goals in mind. First, we sought to obtain genomic information that could be used in future studies of the molecular mechanisms underlying the biosynthesis of pearl in the bivalve mollusc. Pearls are of significant value industrially and as jewels; better understanding of the mechanism is essential to further improvement of pearl production in the fisheries industry. To date, mechanisms involved in the nacreous layer formation in the pearl oyster have been studied extensively.1–4 The shell of pearl oysters consists of two distinct structures: inner nacreous layers composed of aragonite and outer prismatic layers composed of calcite. An intriguing question in the field of bio-mineralization research is how the two polymorphs of calcium carbonate are produced in the same organism. Previous studies that explored these bio-mineralization processes identified and characterized a wide variety of genes and proteins; their functions have also been examined in association with shell formation.4–6 For example, Kinoshita et al.7 conducted an expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis of P. fucata genes expressed in the pallial mantle, which forms the nacreous layer, and in the mantle edge, which forms the prismatic layer. That study generated 29 682 unique sequences, from which the authors succeeded in identifying multiple genes, some novel, that may play roles in the pearl formation. In spite of such extensive studies, however, we still have only a limited understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying pearl oyster shell formation. Decoding the genome of pearl oysters is therefore essential for future genome-wide analyses of these mechanisms. (A) The pearl oyster P. fucata and its pearl. Scale bar, 1 cm.

(B) Flow cytometry of a mixture of sperm from Pinctata and Oryzias. The Pinctata genome, estimated to be ~1150 Mb in size, is slightly larger than the Oryzias genome (~1100 Mb).Our second goal was to improve our overall understanding of the biology of bivalve molluscs, specifically those features that characterize molluscs and their evolution among metazoans and/or lophotrochozoans.8–10 Lophotrochozoa is one of the largest clades of bilaterians, together with the Ecdysozoa and Deuterostomia. The core group of Lophotrochozoa includes molluscs, annelids, nemertines, lophophorates, and platyhelminths. Since these core groups show the greatest variety of adult body plans, the relationships among the lophotrochozoan taxa are still controversial.11 Although adult morphology varies vastly across the group, many core lophotrochozoans share spiral cleavage and a trochophore larval stage. Understanding the proposed repeated losses of both spiral cleavage and trochophore larvae in the Lophotrochozoa clade requires comparative studies of genes involved in the formation of body plans, performed on the basis of full genomic information.The phylum Mollusca itself is one of the most diverse animal groups; mollusc species exhibit a range of morphologies and sizes, from microscopic bivalves to 1-m long giant clams.8–10 The phylum includes ~100 000 described and living species. Due to their hard exoskeletal shell, molluscs appear in the fossil record dating from the Cambrian era, and the major bivalves were established by the Middle Ordovician.12,13 However, the search for bivalve ancestors has proved less straightforward, mainly due to differing interpretations of the extant microfossils. Mollusca comprise seven or eight major lineages, and three majors are Bivalvia (clams and oysters), Gastropoda (snails and slugs), and Cephalopoda (squids and octopus). A recent phylogenetics of evolutionary relationship among Mollusca by Kocot et al.14 showed a sister-taxon relationship between Bivalvia and Gastropoda.The class Bivalvia includes ~20 000 living species; their developing embryos pass through two larval stages, trochophore and verliger. Bivalves are characterized by their possession of two separate shells, called valves. It is thought that during evolution of molluscs leading to the bivalves, a single dorsal shell in the ancestor was doubled. Recently, Kin et al.15 examined genes involved in this prominent morphological transition in the Japanese spiny oyster Saccostrea kegaki. They found that a member of transforming growth factor beta (TGF-ß) family, dpp, is expressed only in the cells along the dorsal midline, and plays an important role in establishing the characteristic shape of the bivalve shell anlagen.The genome contains all the genetic information of a given organism; therefore, sequenced genomes provide an invaluable basis for studying every aspect of biology. Since the first sequencing of a metazoan genome, the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans16 in 1998, ~35 metazoan genome sequences have been reported. However, there is an apparent bias in the selection of targeted metazoan genomes. In contrast to vertebrates,17–19 basal chordates,20,21 ecdysozoans including Drosophila melanogaster22 and Apis mellifera,23 and cnidarians,24–26 placozoans,27 and the sponge,28 there have been no reports of sequenced genomes in lophotrochozoans, although planarians, annelids, and gastropod molluscs have been the subjects of their own genome projects.With the aims described, in the context of the current status of genome sequencing efforts, we sequenced the genome of the pearl oyster P. fucata. Because of its comparatively large size, the assembly so far obtained is still comparatively short, but the draft genome will provide a platform sufficient for exploring the molecular basis of pearl biosynthesis.2. Materials and methods2.1. Biological materialPinctada fucata (Fig. 1A) cultured at the Pearl Research Institute of Mikimoto Co., Ltd, Shima, Japan, was used in the present study.2.2. Number of chromosomes and genome sizeThe number of chromosomes was determined by chromosome preparation from nuclei of embryonic cells at the blastula and gastrula stages. The chromosomes were spread according to the method described by Shoguchi et al.29 and stained with Giemsa. The number was confirmed from a total of 25 spreads.The genome size of P. fucata was estimated by flow cytometry using sperm nuclei from the same specimen used in the genome sequencing.30 Sperm nuclei were treated with a DAPI flow cytometry kit and a BD Cycletest Plus DNA Reagent Kit (BD Biosciences) and analysed on a BD FACSAria II cell sorter (BD Biosciences). The nuclear suspension was confirmed using a fluorescence microscope. The sperm of Takifugu rubripes (365 Mb),18Oryzias latipes31 (1100 Mb), and Danio rerio (2300 Mb)32 were used for comparison. Runs were performed with stained sperm of each species and also with mixtures of P. fucata sperm with sperm from T. rubripes, O. latipes, or D. rerio. The genome sizes of Takifugu, Oryzias, and Danio were also compared with the published values in order to detect machine-related and/or other technical problems.2.3. Genome sequencing and assemblyThe sperm was obtained from a single male during the spawning season, autumn of 2010. The sperm DNA was fragmented, libraries were prepared and sequenced by whole-genome shotgun (WGS) and paired-end read protocols (4 and 10 kb libraries) using a Roche 454 GS-FLX,33 and by WGS and mate-pair protocols (3 and 10 kb libraries) using an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx (GAIIx) instruments.34The 454 WGS and paired-end reads were assembled de novo by GS De Novo Assembler version 2.6 (Newbler, Roche).33 Subsequent scaffolding of the Newbler output was performed by SSPACE35 by adding the Illumina mate-pair sequence information.2.4. Transcriptome analysesRNA was isolated from nine different stages, from eggs to D-stage larvae. Total RNA was extracted using TRIzol (Invitrogen) and purified using DNase and an RNeasy micro kit (QIAGEN). mRNA was amplified using a MessageAmp II aRNA Amplification Kit (Ambion). Transcriptome libraries were sequenced using the 454 GS-FLX. Transcriptome data were also obtained from the mantle edge, pallial muscle, and pearl sac.7 All sequences were poly-A trimmed and assembled by Newbler.2.5. Gene predictionA set of gene model predictions (the P. fucata Gene Model version 1.0) was generated using AUGUSTUS 2.0.4.36 All of the following were incorporated as AUGUSTUS ‘hints’: all raw transcriptome reads (except ribosomal RNA sequences); assembled ESTs of P. fucata; bivalve EST data sets available on NCBI; and putative protein-coding loci found using BLASTX on scaffolds present in the proteomes of D. melanogaster, Mus musculus, and Homo sapiens. Next, we aligned models to an annotated transposable element (TE) database using BLASTP (1e-10) to filter out genes that overlapped TE proteins over >60% of their exonic length. All the EST sequences that encode putative full-length proteins were screened by PASA,37 and ~200 EST assemblies randomly selected from the screened ESTs were used for AUGUSTUS training. The gene models were created by running AUGUSTUS on repeat-masked genome sequences produced by RepeatMasker.382.6. TEs and repetitive sequencesTandem repeats were detected using Tandem Repeat Finder (version 4.04),39 and then classified using Tandem Repeats Analysis Program (version 1.1).40 A de novo repeats library was generated by RepeatScout (version 1.0.5).41 The repeats were annotated based on BLAST hits to Repbase TE library (version 16.05).42 Transposons and SINEs (short interspersed nuclear elements) in the scaffold were identified using CENSOR (version 4.2)43 by BLAST search against the P. fucata repeat library.2.7. Gene annotation and identification of genes in the genomeThree approaches, individually or in combination, were used to annotate the protein-coding genes in the P. fucada genome. Our primary approach to the identification of putative orthologues of P. fucada genes was reciprocal BLAST analysis. This was carried out on the basis of mutual best-hit in the BLAST analyses of human, mouse, or Drosophila genes against the P. fucada gene models (BLASTP) or the assembly (TBLASTN).A second approach, used in the case of gene-encoding proteins with one or more specific protein domains, was to screen the merged models against the Pfam database (Pfam-A.hmm, release 24.0; http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk)44, which contains ~11 000 conserved domains, using HMMER (hmmer3).452.8. Genome browserA genome browser has been established using the assembled genome sequences using the Generic Genome Browser (GBrowse), version 2.17.462.9. Mitochondrial genomeContigs containing mitochondrial genes were searched by BLASTN and BLASTX using bivalvian mitochondrial genes as queries. Mitochondrial protein-coding sequences thereby obtained were confirmed using open reading frame (ORF) Finder (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/gorf/) using the invertebrate mitochondrial genetic code as a reference. The tRNA genes were annotated using DOGMA,47 ARWEN48 with default settings, and tRNAscan-SE 1.249 with a COVE cut-off score of 1.We also performed reconstruction and extension of the mitochondrial DNA sequences, using the following strategy: first, mitochondrial gene sequences obtained above were set as ‘seeds’. A total of 454 raw reads that yielded BLAST hits against the seed sequences were picked up and assembled using Newbler (version 2.6). Assembled sequences were BLAST searched against mitochondrial sequences, and BLAST-hit sequences were used as seeds for the next round of BLAST-assembly workflow. This process was replicated until the contigs did not extend any further.2.10. Molecular phylogenyBased on the study by Philippe et al.50 in which only genes with a moderate rate of amino acid substitution were targeted for molecular phylogeny, we performed mutual best-hit BLAST analyses against three metazoans (H. sapiens, D. melanogaster, and P. fucata) and selected a set of 2087 orthologous genes. Next, the orthologous gene set was surveyed in the genomes of the beetle Tribolium castaneum, the mosquito Anopheles gambiae, the pea aphid Acyrthosiphon pisum, the water flea Daphnia pulex, the lancelet Branchiostoma floridae, the tunicate Ciona intestinalis, the fugu T. rubripes, the zebrafish D. rerio, the anole Anolis carolinensis, the chicken Gallus gallus, the opossum Monodelphis domestica, and the mouse M. musculus. The sea anemone Nematostella vectensis and the coral Acropora digitifera were also examined as outgroup. Most of the protein sequences were retrieved from Refseq (NCBI) through GenomeNet (http://www.genome.jp), except for N. vectensis and D. pulex (Joint Genome Institute, http://genome.jgi-psf.org).In order to avoid mixing paralogous genes, we performed a BLAST search under stringent conditions (E-value cut-off at 1e-50). Genes detected in all species were aligned using ClustalW,51 and poorly aligned regions were excluded using Gblocks.52 Next, Neighbor Joining tree of each gene was generated with ClustalW to evaluate the branch length of the trees. Each gene with moderate branch length was concatenated and used for molecular phylogenetic analyses. We ran RAxML 7.2.853 for maximum likelihood analyses using the WAG+CAMMA+F model for the whole data matrix. Bootstrap analysis was performed on the basis of 100 replicates.3. Results and discussion3.1. Number of chromosomes and genome sizeAs a part of the P. fucata genome project, we examined the number of chromosomes and estimated the genome size. The chromosome number of P. fucata was previously reported by Wada54 to be 2n= 28. We confirmed this number of chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S1).The genome size of P. fucata was estimated by comparing genomes of other metazoans with reported size estimation. We found that the genome size of P. fucata was a little larger than that of the medaka O. latipes (Fig. 1B; Supplementary Fig. S2D and E). Since the genome size of O. latipes has been calculated to be ~1100 Mb,31 we estimated the P. fucata genome to be ~1150 Mb in size. According to the Animal Genome Size Database, Release 2.0 (http://www.genomesize.com), the genome sizes of bivalves are between 1200 and 2100 Mb. Thus, the P. fucata genome is comparatively small among bivalves.3.2.

The Roche 454 sequencing platform generated a total of 44.5 M WGS reads, yielding 15.2 Gb of sequence (average read length was 341 bp) and 11.6 M paired-end reads (the insert sizes were 4 and 10 kb, respectively; average read lengths were 286 and 309 bp, respectively), yielding 3.5 Gb of sequence. In addition, the Illumina platform generated 76 M WGS reads (3.9 Gb) and 22.8 Gb mate-pair sequences (10.9 Gb for the 3-kb library and 11.9 Gb for the 10-kb library). A total of 45.4 Gb were sequenced. Based on the genome size estimation of 1.15 Gb (see above), this corresponds to ~40-fold coverage of the P. fucata genome. Flow chart for sequencing and assembly of the P. fucata genome.Flow chart for sequencing and assembly of the P. fucata genome.The 454 WGS and paired-end reads were assembled (Fig. 2). A total of 18.7 Gb of sequence, which corresponds to 16.3× of the estimated genome size, was used at this stage. The reads were first screened and trimmed using the built-in filter module of Newbler in order to remove potential primer and adaptor contamination. About 17 Gb were used for the subsequent assembly procedure; 14 Gb was successfully aligned to form contigs. The assembled genome contained 1 085 563 contigs with an N50 size of 1629 bp (Table 1; Supplementary Table S1; Fig. 2). The longest contig was 44.5 kb, and ~40% of the sequences were covered by contigs of >2 kb in length (Supplementary Table S1). The assembled genome contained a total of 1024 Mb, which is comparable with the estimated genome size (Supplementary Table S1; Fig. 2). Gaps in the contig assembly were only 7.6 kb (Fig. 2). Summary of the Roche 454 and Illumina GAIIx data used for assembling P. fucata genome sequencesaEach 454 raw reads were separated into ‘forward’ and ‘reverse’.Summary of the Roche 454 and Illumina GAIIx data used for assembling P. fucata genome sequencesaEach 454 raw reads were separated into ‘forward’ and ‘reverse’.Subsequent scaffolding of the 1 085 563-contig Newbler output was performed using the Illumina mate-pair information. The final assembly contained 800 982 scaffolds with an N50 size of 14.5 kb (Table 1; Supplementary Table S2; Fig. 2). The total length of scaffolds was 1029 Mb (a total of 1413–384 Mb gaps; Fig. 2). The size of the longest scaffold was 709.8 kb; three scaffolds extended over 500 kb in length. Approximately 44% of the sequences were covered by scaffolds of >20 kb in length (Supplementary Table S2). The scaffolds included ~384-Mb gaps containing unknown sequences (Fig. 2); gap size distribution is shown in Supplementary Table S3.3.3. Examination of possible causes of incomplete genome assemblyAs described above, in spite of our considerable sequence coverage (~40-fold) of the P. fucata genome, its contig N50 and scaffold N50 were comparatively small. Possible reasons for this include the large genome size, the presence of various types of repetitive sequence (see Section 3.9), and high allelic polymorphism or heterozygosity. We examined whether allelic polymorphism affected the assembly; in addition, we examined the assembly of mitochondrial genome in this context. These analyses are described below.We analysed the relationship between contig sizes and coverage depth. In haploid genomes, or diploid genomes with very low heterozygosity, this relationship would take the form of a Gaussian distribution curve with a single peak. On the other hand, in the case of a diploid genome with high allelic polymorphism, the plot would appear as a curve with two peaks with approximately double coverage-depth relation. As shown in Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S3, a curve with two distinct peaks appeared in the graph, one at around ~18× the coverage depth and the other at ~10×. Most of the 100 longest contigs were present in the former group, indicating that this region consisted of sequences with lower polymorphism. This notion is also supported by the fact that the average coverage depth of this region (18.2×) was similar to the overall sequence coverage for contig construction (16.3×). Distribution of the contig lengths (Y-axis) and their coverage depth (X-axis) in the current P. fucata genome assembly. A coverage range between 1 and 50 is shown for convenience. The 100 longest contigs (44–18 kb) are plotted as red dots; all others are plotted as gray dots. Two significant peaks appeared near coverage depths 10 and 20, respectively. The difference in read coverage of the contigs is likely to be derived from heterozygosity in the genome. The majority of the longest contigs (89 out of the top 100) are covered more than 15 times. See also Supplementary Fig. S3 for further distribution analysis.Distribution of the contig lengths (Y-axis) and their coverage depth (X-axis) in the current P. fucata genome assembly.

Two significant peaks appeared near coverage depths 10 and 20, respectively. The difference in read coverage of the contigs is likely to be derived from heterozygosity in the genome. The majority of the longest contigs (89 out of the top 100) are covered more than 15 times. See also Supplementary Fig. S3 for further distribution analysis.The green area of Supplementary Fig. S3, which represents nucleotides of 10× coverage depth, covers 668 837 291 bases, accounting for 65.3% of the total contig size (1 024 053 188 bases), whereas the yellow area covers 25.3% (258 687 068 bases). It is highly likely that the green area consists of contigs with high polymorphism and the yellow area those with less polymorphism. If so, nearly two-thirds of genome sequences are highly polymorphic. As this would prevent proper contig assembly, polymorphism is probably one of the major reasons why contig N50 is small.The size of the P. fucata genome, as estimated by flow cytometry, is 1150 Mb (Fig. 1B). On the other hand, the euchromatic region of the genome is ~666 Mb (see Supplementary data), indicating that ~58% of the genome is euchromatic and the other 42% heterochromatic. The euchromatic sequences occupy ~73 and 66% of the genomes of C. intestinalis and O. latipes, respectively. Compared with these, the pearl oyster genome includes more heterochromatic regions; this may be one of the reasons why the P. fucata genome is comparatively large.On the other hand, if the former are of less allelic polymorphism while the latter high allelic polymorphism, this result raises an intriguing possibility. As mentioned in Section 2, the pearl oyster whose genome is described in this study is from a strain that Mikimoto Co. has cultivated for more than 30 years. The strain might have been selected for better production of pearls under both qualitative and quantitative genetic pressure. If this is the case, and if genes found in the genomic area with less heterozygosity are responsible for calcification or pearl production, we may have revealed some of the reasons why this strain is advantageous for pearl production. On the other hand, polymorphic genes from the region with high heterozygosity will be useful as markers in studies of the population genetics of pearl oysters.In contrast to the large nuclear genome, which encodes more than 20 000 protein-coding genes, the typical mitochondrial genome of metazoans is small, circular, and 15-17 kb long.55 It contains genes encoding 13 proteins of the respiratory chain [cytochorome c oxidase subunit I-III (cox1, cox2, and cox3), apocytochrome b (cytb), ATPase 6 and 8 (atp6 and atp8), and NADH dehydrogenase subunits 1–6 and 4L (nad1–6 and nad4L), two for rRNA (rrnS and rrnL), and 22 genes for tRNA (trn)].55 Although molluscs in general, and bivalves in particular, exhibit an extraordinarily high degree of mitochondrial gene order variation when compared with other clades of metazoans,56–58 it is reasonable to analyse the P. fucata mitochondrial genome to examine the degree of contig construction.First, BLAST search, using bivalvian mitochondrial genes as queries against contigs of the P. fucata draft genome, yielded three contigs containing mitochondrial genes (Fig. 4A). The first and largest contig (no. 46136), which consisted of 11 459 bp, contained rrnL, trnE, trnM, nad5, cox1, cox2, nad6, atp6, cox3, nad3, trnC, trnP, trnH, nad1, trnL, trnN, trnF, and nad4, in that order. The second contig (no. 46133), 4127 bp in length, contained trnD, trnQ, trnG, trnA, nad2, trnR, trnT, trnL, and trnK, in that order (Fig. 4A). The third contig (no. 46134), 857 bp in length, included rrnS. This analysis did not identify atp8, trnI, trnS, trnW, trnY, or trnV. Previous studies, however, demonstrated that atp8 has been lost independently from the mitochondrial genomes of several bivalves and oysters.56–58Arrangement of P. fucata mitochondrial genes in (A) three contigs and (B) two cluster constructions of the genome.Arrangement of P. fucata mitochondrial genes in (A) three contigs and (B) two cluster constructions of the genome.Secondly, we reconstructed contigs that contained only mitochondrial genes, as described in Section 2. This analysis yielded two contigs, mt1 and mt2 (Fig. 4B). mt1, 12 066 bp in length, contained genes whose arrangement is identical to contig 46136 (Fig. 4B). On the other hand, mt2 (5142 bp) contained trnD, trnQ, trnG, trnA, nad2, trnR, trnT, trnL, trnK, trnW, and rrnS; in other words, contigs 46133 and 46134 were joined via trnW into a single mitochondrial contig, mt2 (compare Fig. 4A and B).These analyses of mitochondrial genes suggest that the coverage of the pearl oyster genome sequences (both nuclear and mitochondrial DNAs) was high. The occurrence of the three contigs obtained via BLAST (no. 46136, 46133, and 46134), compared with that of two reconstructed mitochondrial contigs, suggested that the sequence assembly and contig construction themselves were not always insufficient. This also supports the notion that the low contig N50 was caused by high allelic polymorphism in pearl oyster nuclear DNA.3.4. The GC contentThe GC content was estimated to be ~34% from the assembled genome sequences (Fig. 5), and therefore the pearl oyster genome is AT-rich. Figure 5 shows GC contents of genomes of various metazoans for comparison; they ranged from low values (34% in P. fucata and C. elegans; 35% in Strongylocentrotus purpuratus) to higher values (40% in H. sapiens; 38% in B. floridae) genomes. Based on these comparisons, we conclude that P. fucata has a relatively high AT-content among metazoans. The GC content of the P. fucata assembled genome (500 bp sliding window). The vertical axis shows counts of DNA sequence reads; the horizontal axis, percentage of GC in the reads. The GC content of the pearl oyster genome was estimated to be ~34%.

Sequence contamination from other organismsThe present P. fucata genome project used sperm DNA from a single male. In the assembled genome, we have not detected any sequences that are predicted to correspond to bacteria or other contaminating organisms. The single peak in the GC content of the raw reads (Fig. 5) further supported lack of sequence contamination.3.6. EST sequencing, clustering, and mappingTranscriptome analysis is essential in order to understand the genes that are expressed in a given organism. As mentioned before, a recent EST analysis of P. fucata identified 29 682 unique sequences.7 Here, we performed EST analyses of P. fucata with the aid of a Roche 454 GS-FLX. RNA was isolated from a mixture of nine developmental stages. Sequencing yielded 36 780 contigs (29.3 Mb) over 100 bp with an N50 size of 1575 bp. Of these, 33 570 (91.3%) had a BLAT alignment to the assembled genome (using default settings). Of the 36 780 contigs, 8571 contained a complete ORF of at least 450 bp. Of these putatively full-length EST contigs, 8342 (97.3%) had a BLAT alignment to the assembled scaffolds. These data were used to produce gene models and annotation.3.7. Gene modellingThe final set of the P. fucata gene model version 1 contained 43 760 genes (Table 2). Of them, 23 257 were complete models with the both start and stop codons (Table 2). Of these, 69.7% are substantially supported by P. fucata ESTs (Table 2). The gene model of P. fucataThe gene model of P. fucataAt the present modelling stage, the average length of genes was 7700 bp. The number of exons per gene was 3.2, and average length of exons was 589 bp, suggesting that a gene consists of 1885-bp long exons on average. Thus, each gene contains on average 4815 bp of intronic sequence (6700–1885 = 4815). The long intron insertions partially explain the large genome size of P. fucata. Proteins consisted of 274 amino acids on average.The 43 760 predicted protein-coding loci should be examined by further improvement of sequence assembly and gene prediction. Due to the short lengths of contigs and scaffolds, presumably caused by insufficient coverage of the comparatively large genome, the model may include predictions that do not represent bona fide protein-coding genes. Such spurious predictions could arise from unrecognized repetitive elements and/or splitting of genes between scaffolds. However, BLAST search of the 23 257 predicted Pinctada genes with those of other metazoans showed that 15 077 of the Pinctada gene models (65%) are homologous to other metazoan genes or ESTs.3.8. Genome browserA genome browser has been established (Supplementary Fig. S4) and is available via http://marinegenomics.oist.jp/pinctada_fucata.3.9. TEs and other genomic componentsAs is the case for the pearl oyster, mollusc genomes are comparatively large in size, plausibly due to the presence of a larger number of TEs and repetitive elements in the genome. Recently Yoshida et al.59 examined whether repetitive elements caused expansion of the genome size in molluscs. They showed that the proportions of repetitive elements are 9.2, 4.0, and 3.8% in the pygmy squid, nautilus, and scallop, respectively. Since their genome sizes are estimated to be 2.1, 4.2, and 1.8 Gb, respectively, the authors concluded that the repetitive element expansion does not always explain the increase in genome size; specifically, nautilus is an outlier.We determined the proportion of TEs and repetitive elements in the assembled genome of the pearl oyster. As shown in Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table S4, 0.37 and 1.45% of the P. fucata genome appear to originate from DNA transposons and retrotransposons, respectively. The DNA transposons included Mariner, Polinton, Helitron, Academ, and others, while retrotransposons included LTR retrotransposons such as Gypsy, DIRS, and Bel_Pao as well as non-LTR retrotransposons such as enelop and CR1. The percentages of LINEs (long interspersed nuclear elements such as L1, RTE, and Jockey) and SINEs were not significantly high in the pearl oyster genome. These ratios are lower than those of three mollusc species mentioned above. On the other hand, nearly 7.9% of the genome was occupied by tandem repeat elements (Fig. 6; Supplementary Table S4); among these repeats, microsatellites occupied ~3.7% of the genome. Repeat elements in the P. fucata genome.Repeat elements in the P. fucata genome.It is possible that repetitive elements, especially shorter ones, were discarded during the process of sequence assembly. To examine this issue, we also determined the proportion of DNA transposons, retrotransposons, and tandem repeats in raw data generated in a one-run WGS read. We determined that the three data sets yielded similar results; one example is shown in Supplementary Table S4. The percentages of DNA transposons and retrotransposons were 0.4 and 2.7, respectively, suggesting that the assembly process did not affect so much the estimation of DNA transposons and retrotransposons in the Pinctada genome.Although the ratio of these components is likely to be underestimated, owing to the insufficient assembly of genome sequences because of the large genome size, these data indicate that the Pinctada genome contains a comparatively small number of DNA transposons, retrotransposons, and tandem repeats. Therefore, the presence of these elements is not the cause of the large genome size.3.10. Identification of P. fucata genes reported to be associated with shell formationTo date, cDNAs and/or proteins for more than 80 genes have been reported as those associated with the calcification and/or bivalve shell formation.6 These include Aspein,60 ferritin,61 KRMP,62 MSI60,63 N16,64 N19,65 Nacrein,66 PFMG,67 Pfty (Pictada fucata tyrosinase-1),68 Pif177,69 Prisilkin-39,70 Prismalin-14,71 and Shematrin72 (Table 3). In order to examine the validity of the assembled genome, we searched for corresponding genes in the assembled P. fucata genome. We found the presence of 21 corresponding genes in the genome (Table 3). We found four genes corresponding to N-19 in the genome, three of which are aligned in scaffold 2495, suggesting tandem duplication of the genes (data not shown). The gene location in the P. fucata genome for reported cDNAs or proteins that are associated with pearl oyster shell matrix formationThe gene location in the P. fucata genome for reported cDNAs or proteins that are associated with pearl oyster shell matrix formationThese results suggest that the present draft genome will be useful for exploration of the organization of various genes in the pearl oyster genome. An annotation and characterization of the pearl formation-related genes, found in previous studies, are now underway (Kinoshita et al., unpublished).3.11. Transcription factors and signal transduction moleculesTranscription factors and signal transduction molecules play pivotal roles in the formation of animal body plans.73,74 Qualitative and quantitative changes in these molecules have been discussed in the context of the evolution of mollusc body plans.15,75 We examined transcription factors and signal transduction molecules using the Pfam domain method.We determined the number of domains that have been identified in transcription factors and compared it with the genomes of N. vectensis, D. melanogaster, and H. sapiens (Supplementary Table S5). The domains include HLH, homeobox, nuclear hormone receptors, POU, bZIP1, Ets, Fork head, PAX, SRF-TF, GATA, HMG box, RHD, DM SRF, Runt, P53 DNA-binding domain, T-box, and others (Supplementary Table S5). This analysis illustrates several characteristic features of transcription factors in the pearl oyster genome (Supplementary Table S5). First, the genome contains major transcription factors found in other metazoan genomes. For example, in the Gene Model version 1.0, the Pinctada genome contains 43 genes for the bHLH domain, 88 genes for the homeobox domain, and 25 for nuclear hormone receptor domains. These numbers are comparable with those found in the Drosophila genome, and about half of those found in the human genome.3.12. Signalling moleculesRecent studies of genes encoding cell-cell signalling molecules in molluscs reported unexpected complexity among the signalling genes. As in the case of identifying domains associated with transcription factors, we used the Pfam domain method to identify genes involved in cell-cell signal transduction. The results are summarized in Supplementary Table S6. The Pinctada genome contains genes that encode major signalling molecules, including members of the Wnt family, TGF-ß family, and G-protein-coupled signalling family (Supplementary Table S6). For example, the Pinctada, Nematostella, and Drosophila genomes contain, respectively, 4, 6, and 8 candidates for the TGF-ß family, and 9, 13, and 10 candidates for the G-protein-coupled signalling family. At present, the Pinctada genome contains six genes in the Wnt family and one gene in the FGF family (Supplementary Table S6).Although the human genome contains genes for interleukin domains, the Nematostella and Drosophila genomes are unlikely to have genes for interleukin domains, including interleukin-2, -3, -4, -5, -7, -11, and -12 (Supplementary Table S6). The mollusc P. fucata genome also lacks interleukin genes.3.13. Molecular phylogeny of the molluscsMolecular phylogeny is a powerful and objective method for inferring the phylogenic relationships of extant metazoans; various molecules have recently been used, singly or in combination, to deduce mollusc phylogeny in the context of the evolution of lophotrochozoans. For example, Dunn et al.11 examined the broad phylogenic relationship among animals, using data from 77 taxa and 150 genes. This study positioned Mollusca in a clade of Lophotrochozoa, together with another group that includes Annelida, Phoronidae, Nemertea, and Entoprocta. On the other hand, Paps et al.76 reported that Mollusca forms a clade with Brachiozoa as a group of Spiralia within Lophotrochozoa.Within the 2087 orthologus genes, 409 genes were detected in all selected organisms, which allowed us to compare 77 547 aligned amino acid positions (see Section 2). As shown in Fig. 7, the tree indicates that the mollusc forms a clade of Lophotrochozoa that is independent from a clade comprising ecdysozoans and deuterostomes. This is the first confirmation by genome-wide analyses using nuclear genes of the three major groups of bilaterians. Molecular phylogeny of the pearl oyster. A total of 77 547 aligned amino acid positions of proteins encoded by 409 genes were obtained from the triploblasts T. castaneum, D. melanogaster, A. gambiae, A. pisum, P. fucata, B. floridae, C. intestinalis, D. rerio, T. rubripes, M. domestica, G. gallus, A. carolinensis, M. musculus, and H. sapiens. The sequences were analysed using ML methods, with the diploblasts A. digitifera and N. vectensis serving as an outgroup. The scale bar represents 0.05 expected substitutions per site in the aligned regions. The topology was supported by 100% bootstrap value. This analysis shows the phylogenic position of molluscs obtained using genome-wide data from all of these species.Molecular phylogeny of the pearl oyster.

ConclusionWe sequenced the genome of the pearl oyster P. fucata using pyrosequencing technologies. The draft genome, ~1150 Mb at this draft stage, contains 23 257 complete gene models. Most likely, the assembled genome contains almost no sequences derived from other organisms such as bacteria, because the genome DNA was obtained from the sperm of a single male. In spite of the recent accumulation of genomic information in various metazoan taxa, there have been very few reports of sequenced genomes of molluscs and/or lophotrochozoans. This study therefore provides the first opportunity to obtain insight into a bivalvian mollusc genome. The P. fucata genome also provides a basic platform for further studies of the biosynthesis of pearl, which has a significant importance in the fisheries industry. Such studies are now in progress by multiple investigators, including the authors of this study.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournal.org.FundingThis work was supported by the OIST Internal Fund for Marine Genomics Unit.

IntroductionThe transcriptome is made up of the subset of genes active in a selected tissue and species. Understanding the dynamics of the transcriptome is essential for interpreting phenotypic variation caused by combinations of genotypic and environmental factors.1 Massively parallel sequencing of RNA2 (RNA-Seq) has offered the opportunity to characterize the transcriptome with unprecedented sensitivity and depth. It has already revolutionized the way we study the transcriptome. The latest paired-end sequencing of RNA-Seq techniques have further improved the efficiency of DNA sequencing and expanded short read lengths, permitting a deeper understanding of the transcriptome.3 RNA-Seq is independent of prior knowledge and does not require design work, thus reducing the required staff, cost and time and providing the unprecedented opportunity to conduct low-cost transcriptome studies at lower cost for non-model organisms. The RNA-Seq technology has been applied to many model organisms4–12 for the discovery of splice variants, RNA editing sites and new microRNAs, but fewer studies were conducted in non-model fish organisms.13,14The Actinopterygii, in terms of numbers, are the dominant class of vertebrate, comprising nearly 96% of the 26 000 species of fish.15 However, the genomic information of this group is very rare: only six genomes16–19 and several transcriptomes20,21 are available. This has hindered research into these valuable species. Cyprinidae is the largest family of freshwater fish in the Actinopterygii.15 The endemic clade of East Asian Cyprinidae displays a tremendous diversity of phenotypic and ecological traits in this area. This clade is an ideal model system for the study of rapid radiations and evolutionary adaptation over short periods of time.22 Silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitrix) of the family Cyprinidae are among the most intensively pond-cultured species in China. As one of famous four major Chinese carps, breeding production reached 3 million tons in China in 2009.23 Aside from their great importance to the fishery economy, silver carp have been found useful in counteracting cyanobacteria blooms in China.24,25 Silver carp are also a good model for the study of speciation because of its split with bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis), which occurred only ~3 Mya.26 However, lack of genomic resources like genome sequence, transcriptome sequences and molecular markers has made the study of silver carp breeding, the mechanism of its ability to counteract water bloom and evolutionary analysis a difficult task.When no genome sequence is available, transcriptome sequencing is an effective way to obtain large numbers of molecular makers and identify transcripts involved in specific biological processes. In this study, we present the first silver carp transcriptome using massively parallel mRNA sequencing. We perform Illumina sequencing of the heart, liver, brain, spleen and kidney tissues to characterize the H. molitrix transcriptome. A database (Silver Carp Base) is under construction and we expect that it will provide the first picture of the transcriptome of this species. The database will be updated in the future if additional data become available.2. Materials and methods2.1. Ethics statementAll experimental protocols were approved by the ethics committee of Institute of HydroBiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences.2.2. Organ collection and RNA isolationA wild silver carp was collected from the middle reach of the Yangtze River. To obtain the whole transcriptome, RNA from five organs (heart, liver, brain, spleen and kidneys) was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). After the quality examination by the way of electrophoresis and a BioPhotometer plus 6132 (Eppendorf, Germany), RNAs from different organs were mixed together at equivalent concentrations. Total RNA extraction was in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol and it was treated with RNase-free DNase I (New England Biolabs) for 30 min at 37°C to remove the residual DNA.2.3. cDNA library preparation and sequencingBeads with oligo(dT) were used to purify poly(A) mRNA from total RNA. Then, the mRNA was fragmented using a RNA fragmentation kit (Ambion). First-strand cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer-primer and reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and second-strand cDNA was synthesized next. Then the paired-end cDNA library was prepared in accordance with Illumina's protocols with an insert size of 200 bp and sequenced for 75 bp. The Illumina GA processing pipeline v0.2.2.6 was used to analyze the image and for base calling.2.4. De novo assembly of silver carp transcriptomeAs no optimal k-mer length is appropriate for all de novo transcriptome assemblies, the multiple k-mer method was used to obtain longer silver carp mRNA sequences, which are very useful in subsequent analysis steps. Our method is based on the modified ‘additive Multi-k’ method described by Yann Surget-Groba27 After removing reads with the sequencing adapter and reads of low quality, paired-end reads were subjected to de novo assembly using ABySS28 with k-mer lengths of 58, 54, 52, 50, 48, 46, 44, 42, 40, 38 and 34. The unused reads at higher k-mer lengths were not discarded before running the assembly for a lower k-mer length. The output data set of each k-mer length was subjected to SSPACE29 for scaffolding, respectively. When pooling all the results together, some contigs and scaffolds appeared in two or more assemblies, causing redundancy. These were removed using CD-HIT-EST.30 The longest possible contigs and scaffolds were retained. At last, the STM+ method27 was used to perform translation mapping scaffolding with the Danio rerio proteome31 serving as a reference.2.5. Sequence annotationThe assembled sequences were blasted against the NCBI Nr (non-redundant) protein database and Swiss-prot database using BLASTX32 and an E-value of 1e-5. To shorten the search time, searches were limited to the first 10 significant hits for each query. Gene names were assigned to each sequence according to its best BLAST hit (highest score).The Blast2GO suit33 was used for functional annotation of assembled sequences applying the function for the mapping of gene ontology (GO) terms to sequences with BLAST hits obtained from hits with E-value < 1e-5, annotation cut-off > 55 and a GO weight > 5 were used for annotation. Assembled sequences were thus assigned to primary and sub-GO functional categories.2.6. Simple sequence repeat markers discoveryA microsatellite program (MISA)34 (http://pgrc.ipkgatersleben.de/misa/) was used to identify and localize microsatellite motifs. We searched for all types of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) from mononucleotide to hexanucleotides using the following parameters: at least 10 repeats for mono-, 6 repeats for di- and 5 repeats for tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexanucleotide for simple repeats. Both perfect (i.e. SSRs contain a single repeat motif like such as ‘ATC’) and compound (i.e. composed of two or more motifs separated by <100 bp) SSRs were identified.2.7. Positive selectionAll the 44 sequences involved in the biosynthesis of glutathione (GSH) were downloaded from Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) and used as a query to blast against the 85 759 sequences assembled. Only the reciprocal BLAST best-hit result sequence was kept to form the sequence pair with its corresponding query. To determine whether the sequence pair underwent positive selection, a likelihood ratio test (LRT) was performed for the Nsite 7 and Nsite 8 of codeml in PAML was used.353. Results3.1. De novo assembly with multiple k-mer lengths and sequence validationWe prepared the mixed cDNAs from the heart, liver, brain, spleen and kidneys of silver carp at equivalent concentration. One lane of Illumina Genome Analyzer was performed and ~17.10 million 75 bp paired-end reads were obtained. After cleaning the low-quality reads, we used a modified version of a previous published procedure27 (see Materials and methods) to assemble the reads for non-redundant consensus. The bioinformatics workflow is depicted in the flowchart shown in Supplementary Fig. 1S. Short read data have been deposited in NCBI's Short Read Archive at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra under the accession SRP008133.To assemble the paired-end reads into contigs, we used ABySS28 with different k-mer lengths (Table 1). Although paired-end information has been used in ABySS, a great improvement was found after scaffolding the contigs with SSPACE29 (Table 2). After pooling all the scaffolds obtained from multiple k-mers together, 3 930 925 sequences were collected. Using CD-HIT-EST,30 scaffolds were assembled into clusters that were analyzed for consensus. Finally, 85 796 sequences ranging from 200 to 13 880 bp were collected. The length distribution of all the sequences is shown in Fig. 1.

Figure 2 depicts the relationship of RPKM versus the transcript size. Transcript length increased with coverage depth and reached an asymptote approximately at an average coverage of ~50.

RPKM, Reads Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads.Until now, no general criteria have been proposed as standards for evaluation of the quality of transcriptome assembly. We used three substantial factors to assess how well the assembled sequences represent the actual transcriptome population: (i) gene coverage, (ii) transcript sequence quality and (iii) completeness.The transcriptome gene coverage was judged by comparison with the sequence information available for silver carp. All 13 mitochondrial protein-coding genes and 203 of 217 proteins in the NCBI database were present in our assembled scaffolds. We compared our assembled scaffolds with the zebrafish transcriptome (ENSEMBL Zv61) and found that 40 509 of 41 759 (85.9%) zebrafish transcripts have matches in assembled scaffolds. At the same time, 19 893 reciprocal best-hit blast matches with the zebrafish transcriptome were identified using E-value 1e-5.Transcriptome quality was assessed by comparing the mitochondrial protein-coding genes found in assembled sequences to mitochondrion sequence in GenBank (NC_010156). A total of 10 185 nucleotide identities were observed out of 10 522 (96.8%) total nucleotide length of contig to coding mitochondrial sequences BLAST matches, suggesting very good transcriptome sequence quality. The observed 3.2% sequence difference might be due to the high intraspecific genetic variability.Finally, in terms of sequence completeness, the relative number of full-length sequences in the 19 893 reciprocal best-hit blast matches to zebrafish transcriptome was estimated. A sequence was considered full length if it contained the complete 5'- and 3'-UTR of the mRNA. In this study, we used a less stringent but broadly adopted definition, considering a sequence to be full length if it comprised at least the complete coding sequence (CDS).21 We mapped the 19 893 sequences to their corresponding CDS in the zebrafish transcript, and if the CDS was fully covered by assembled sequence, we thought the sequence as full-length sequence. Under the criteria given above, 1937 sequences (9.7%) were validated as full length. One thousand, six hundred and thirty-five sequences (8.2%) covered more than 95% of the zebrafish CDS and 2394 sequences (12.0%) covered more than 75% of the zebrafish CDS. For a pseudo-stop codon usually appears on a chimeric or truncated transcript, we translated the nucleotide sequences to protein sequences to verify the completeness of the transcripts. One thousand, three hundred and seventy-seven sequences were validated as full length and 2109 sequences covered more than 95% of the zebrafish CDS.In addition to the computing methods given above, Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay was used to validate the quality of the assembled transcriptome. Primers for 22 transcripts with different expression levels (RPKM ranged from 336 to 10 507) were designed and all the cDNAs were amplified. Out of the 22 pairs of primers, 10 pairs were silver-specific transcripts which did not have an NCBI Nr BLAST hit (see Sequence annotation). The primer information and RT–PCR results are shown in Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. S2.3.2. Sequence annotationSeveral complementary methods were used to annotate the assembled sequences. First, the assembled sequences were searched against the Nr protein databases using BLASTX with an E-value of 1e-5. Of the 85 796 assembled sequences, 54 198 (63.2%) had significant matches (Supplementary Table S3). Most of the sequences with top-hit blast result from zebrafish (44 999 sequences; 83.0%). In addition, 18 536 (34.2%) sequences matched predicted proteins, 81 (0.1%) with unknown proteins.Second, silver carp sequences that had matches in Nr databases were given GO annotations with the Uniprot database. Of these, 23 044 were assigned to one or more 3423 GO terms, for a total of 104 196 term occurrences. As many as 17 451 sequences were found to be involved in biological process and could be divided into cellular process (13 382 sequences with percentage of 76.7%), metabolic process (10 846; 62.2%), biological regulation (5032; 28.9%), multicellular organismal process (4386; 25.1%), pigmentation (4296; 24.6%), localization (4162; 23.8%), developmental process (4088; 23.4%), establishment of localization (3448; 19.8%), cellular component organization (2793; 16.0%) and response to stimulus (2275; 13.0%). Other type of functions occurred at <10% each (Fig. 3). Functional classification of silver carp transcriptome and comparison with zebrafish transcriptome. (A) GO: biological process.

(C) GO: cellular component. In some cases, one transcript may have multiple functions. Grey, silver carp; black, zebrafish.GO analysis have also shown that 15 799 sequences were associated with a cellular component, including cell (15 114; 95.6%), cell part (15 114; 95.6%), organelle (8265; 52.3%), organelle part (3624; 22.9%) and macromolecular complex (3042; 19.2%). Moreover, 17 837 sequences showed potential molecular function, such as binding (13 027; 73%), catalytic activity (8473; 47.5%), molecular transducer activity (1648; 9.2%) and transporter activity (1406; 7.8%). The detailed information about the functional classification is shown in Supplementary Table S3.Representation of GO categories in the silver carp transcriptome set was found to be similar to that of the zebrafish GO database, but there were a few differences in each of the three main GO categories (Fig. 3). After correcting for multiple tests, we found that 30 of 37 comparisons were significantly over or underrepresented in comparison to the zebrafish records. For example, among the biological processes, pigmentation (GO: 0043473) was underrepresented in the silver carp transcriptome, while localization (GO: 0051179) and response to stimulus (GO: 0050896) were overrepresented.Meanwhile, annotation of the 85 759 sequences using Clusters of Orthologous Groups of protein (COG) databases yielded good results for 14 840 putative proteins. The COG-annotated putative proteins ranged functionally into at least 25 molecular families, including biochemical metabolism, signal transduction, cellular structure and immune defense, in accordance with the categories observed in GO annotation (Fig. 4).

Metabolic pathways by KEGG analysisA total of 38 200 assembled sequences were found to be involved in 218 predicted KEGG metabolic pathways. The number of sequences ranged from 3 to 4510 (Supplementary Table S4). The top 20 pathways with the greatest number of sequences are shown in Table 3, and the greatest number of transcripts was found in the metabolic pathways. The top 10 metabolic pathways were: purine metabolism (789), pyrimidine metabolism (473), oxidative phosphorylation (436), inositol phosphate metabolism (435), glycerophospholipid metabolism (371), riboflavin metabolism (347), glycolysis/gluconeogenesis (341), lysine degradation (337), pyruvate metabolism (239) and starch and sucrose metabolism (218) (Supplementary Table S5).

Positive selection of genes involved in GSH synthesisMicrocystins (MCs) are cyclic non-ribosomal peptides produced by cyanobacteria. They are cyanotoxins and can be very toxic to fishes and other animals, including humans. With the increasing frequency of water bloom outbreaks in many countries, the task of eliminating them has become both more urgent and more difficult. Recently, the silver carp and bighead carp have been used to counteract cyanobacteria in many lakes in China.24,37 Despite the hepatotoxicity of MC, the body weights of silver carp increase very fast in bodies of water that are full of MCs.38 The high tolerance of silver carp to MCs might be due to the high basic GSH level in the liver or an increased GSH synthesis.39To fully understand the mechanism behind the high tolerance of silver cap to MCs, we evaluated whether the genes involved in glutathione synthesizing were under positive selection in silver carp. From the KEGG databases, 44 genes involved in glutathione synthesis in zebrafish were obtained with the full CDS region (PATHWAY dre00480). After searching against the whole transcriptome sequences, we found that most of the zebrafish CDS had been recovered (Table 4). Sequence pairs were constructed by the zebrafish CDS, and its corresponding best-hit blast scaffolds of silver carp were thereafter tested for whether they had experienced positive selection. For these 44 genes, the average number of codons was found to be 356 (range, 137–966). The F3 × 4 model of codon frequencies was used and models M7 and M8 were used to determine which pairs of sequences were under positive selection. The log-likelihood value under M8 was much higher than its corresponding value under M7, indicating that model M8 is more suitable to the sequence pair compared with model M7. LRT shows that five sequence pairs were found to have P-values <0.05. They are thought to have experienced positive selection between silver carp and zebrafish (Table 5). Sequences recovered in the glutathione synthesizing pathwaySequences recovered in the glutathione synthesizing pathwayGenes determined to be under positive selectionGenes determined to be under positive selection3.5. Identification of SSR or microsatellitesBecause SSRs or microsatellite markers are used for many animal breeding applications, the 85 796 sequences were analyzed for identification of SSR markers. We obtained 13 327 SSR markers in 9636 sequences with the MISA.34 In terms of abundance, mononucleotide repeats were found to be most abundant (7693, 57.3%) followed by dinucleotide repeats (3733, 28.0%) and trinucleotide repeats (1538, 11.5%). Other type of repeat units occurred at <2% each. SSR markers were divided into two groups, perfect SSR markers (only one single repeat motif such as ‘AGC’) and compound SSR markers (composed of two or more SSR markers separated by <100 bp). A total of 1206 (9.0%) compound SSR markers were identified. After excluding the mono-nucleotide repeats, the frequency of an SSR motif was calculated. Among the dinucleotide repeat motifs, AC/GT was the most abundant, with 69.2%; trinucleotide repeat motifs were rich in ATC/GAT, with 27.8%, and tetranucleotide repeat motifs were AGAT/ATCT, with 21.1%.4. DiscussionThe transcriptome is the complete repertoire of expressed RNA transcripts in the cell and its characterization is essential to understanding the functional complexity of the genome. Using the next-generation sequencing technology, we were able to sequence and annotate the transcriptome of silver carp. This is most comprehensive study of silver carp transcriptome data to date. The transcriptome sequences obtained by this study are useful to the understanding of the genetic makeup of the silver carp transcriptome, which until now has been very limited. The Illumina sequencing yielded 17.10 million paired-end reads for silver carp. The 85 769 sequences produced here may be useful for further research into silver carp functional genomics. The obtained overall GC content of the silver carp transcriptome was 39.2%, which was lower than the GC content of cDNA library of zebrafish (Ensembl 61).31 However, when we removed the assembled sequences that contained gaps, the GC content rose to 45.5%, which was similar to that of the zebrafish cDNA library (46.2%).Due to the lack of a complete genome sequence, the quality of transcriptome analysis of non-model species must rely largely on the contigs and scaffolds assembled from the raw reads. After reassembling the transcriptomes of two mosquitoes with known genomes using a de novo assembler, Gibbons et al.40 found that short reads can be used to assemble transcriptomes of non-model organisms. Although the development of the short-read assembler28,41,42 has rendered research facilities capable of dealing with more and more reads, de novo assembly of transcriptomes without known reference genome using short reads is still difficult for transcripts with highly variable coverage.43 So, a higher k-mer length will theoretically generate a more contiguous assembly of highly expressed RNAs while poorly expressed transcripts will be more easily obtained if a lower k-mer length is used.41 Therefore, an approach for de novo assembly of the transcriptome using various k-mer lengths is highly desirable and has been proven useful.27 The final assembly statistics indicate that the multiple k-mer method used in this study outperforms all other single k-mer methods (Table 1). In the single k-mer assembly, the average length and N50 were highest when the k-mer was set to 46, which we found to be best in all single k-mer assemblies. However, the number of contigs >100 bp and total length were twice that of the best single k-mer ABySS assembly. This marked increase was accompanied by a higher N50 and average contig size, indicating a substantial improvement in contiguity.Multiple k-mer methods assembled the Illumina reads into contigs, but the location information in paired-end reads were not used at all. In this study, we improved upon the methods described by Yann et al.27 Results proved that using SSPACE to scaffold the contigs produced by each k-mer could produce longer sequences. The statistics before and after scaffolding (Tables 1 and 2) indicate that a higher average length of sequence can be obtained by joining the two contigs originating from the two ends of a DNA fragment. The max length and the average length of the sequences after scaffolding were further extended. To assess the quality of assembled transcriptome, we used both computing and experimenting assays to validate the transcripts generated. The RT–PCR results confirmed that our method is reliable for the recovery of both highly and poorly expressed transcripts.Both gene annotation and KEGG pathway analyses are useful for us to predict potential genes and their functions at a whole-transcriptome level. In the silver carp transcriptome, as discovered by this study, the predominant gene clusters are involved in the structural formation of the cell, cell part and organelle of a cellular component, the binding and catalytic activity of molecular function, metabolic process and cellular processes of biological processes. Similar results were found in Sus scrofa,44 European eel21 and rainbow trout.45 However, in Chickpea transcriptome, sequences were found to be mainly involved in the protein metabolism of biological process, in chloroplasts, in the transferase activity of molecular function. This suggests remarkable difference between animal and plants. KEGG analysis showed that more than 44.5% of transcripts to be enrichment factors involved in 218 known metabolic or signaling pathways, including cell adherence, migration, apoptosis and immune-related processes. The KEGG pathway analysis and gene annotation may be useful for further investigation of gene function in future. Although there are differences between our silver carp transcriptome and available database for zebrafish in GO annotations, concordance in the overall patterns suggests that our library were widely sampled and provided a good representation.One previous study reported that GSH can conjugate with MC on its sulfhydryl, which is the first step in the detoxification of a cyanobacterial toxin in aquatic organisms.46 The glutathione S-transferase (GST) gene plays important roles both in the biosynthesis of GST and catalysis of the reaction between GSH and MC. M8 assumes 11 site classes: 10 classes for the beta distribution and 1 class for the positively selected site. Therefore, it is suitable to detect positive selection in sequence pairs. Although the value of dN/dS observed in this model might not be precise, the LRT is most likely reliable. Positive selection pressure on GST gene might be the result of the adaptation of silver carp to the eutrophied bodies of water in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River.Genetic markers are of great importance to the understanding genetic variation and to the identification of genes and quantitative trait locus for traits of interested in molecular breeding applications. Until now, only a small number of genetic markers have been available for silver carp.47,48 One of the main reasons for this is the lack of genome sequence information. Alternatively, transcriptomes have been used for the discovery of genetic markers.44,49,50 Although markers developed from transcriptomes are less polymorphic, they have been found to be very useful in trait mapping51 and comparative genomics studies.52It has been reported that SSRs comprise 3% of the human genome, with the largest proportion of them being dinucleotide repeats (0.5%).53 In this study, 28% of the 13 327 silver carp SSRs were found to be dinucleotide repeats, followed by trinucleotide repeats (11.5%). The most common dinucleotide repeats were AC and AG, in contrast to those found in the human genome (AC and AT). The same difference was also found in trinucleotide repeats, with ATC and AGG being most common in silver carp and AAT and AAC being most common in human.53In conclusion, we have determined the transcriptome of silver carp through use of high-throughput Illumina paired-end sequencing. Our study obtained 85 759 scaffolds and demonstrated some important features of silver carp transcriptome, such as gene annotation and KEGG pathway analysis, as shown by cross-transcriptome analysis. In addition, we identified reliable genetic markers for 13 324 SSRs. We also found that five genes identified as under positive selection between silver carp and zebrafish. This study will be helpful for improvement of the understanding of the recent speciation and adaption of Cyprinidae and provides useful resources and markers for future functional genomic research.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis research was supported by the grants from National Basic Research Program of China (973 Program 2010CB126302), National Natural Science Foundation of China (31090254 and U1036603) and Chinese Academy of Sciences (KSCX2-EW-Q-12).Supplementary data"

IntroductionChronic infantile neurological cutaneous and articular syndrome (CINCA; MIM #607115), also known as neonatal-onset multisystem inflammatory disease (NOMID), is a dominantly inherited autoinflammatory disease that is characterized by neonatal onset and a triad of symptoms, including an urticarial-like skin rash, neurological manifestations, and arthritis/arthropathy.1–3 Patients often experience recurrent fever and systemic inflammation. CINCA/NOMID is the most severe clinical phenotype in the spectrum of cryopyrin-associated periodic syndromes (CAPS), which also include two less severe but phenotypically similar syndromes, familial cold autoinflammatory syndrome (FCAS; MIM #120100), and Muckle-Wells syndrome (MWS; MIM #191900). CAPS are caused by mutations in the NLRP3 gene, which is a member of the Nod-like receptor (NLR) family of the innate immune system.4–6Approximately 60% of CINCA/NOMID patients carry heterozygous germline missense mutations in the NLRP3 coding region (mutation-positive patients).7 More than 80 different disease-causing mutations have been reported to date.8 However, the remaining clinically diagnosed CINCA/NOMID patients (~40%) show no heterozygous germline NLRP3 mutation based on conventional DNA sequencing-based genetic analyses (mutation-negative patients). In a previous international collaborative study, we found that there was a high incidence of somatic NLRP3 mosaicism in mutation-negative CINCA/NOMID patients worldwide.9 The level of mosaicism ranges from 4.2 to 35.8% (median = 10.2%). Rapidly diagnosing somatic NLRP3 mosaicism is important to ensure proper treatment. However, the conventional approach used to identify somatic mosaicism of the NLRP3 gene is time and labour intensive due to the subcloning of the NLRP3 exon polymerase chain reaction (PCR) products, hereafter designated as amplicons, followed by capillary DNA sequencing of more than 100 subclones for each patient. Thus, this approach is not suitable to routinely diagnose somatic mosaicism of the NLRP3 gene and additional labour and time will be required to reliably identify somatic mosaicism that occurs at a lower rate. The aim of the present study was to establish a new method that can be used to reliably diagnose somatic mosaicism using the NLRP3 gene as a model. Massively parallel DNA sequencing (MPS) technology is an obvious method of choice to identify somatic mosaicism, and this approach has been already reported by other groups.10–12 However, a well-known caveat of MPS is the high rate of sequencing errors, which cannot be disregarded when identifying low-level somatic mosaicism. To our knowledge, there have been no reports of a reliable method to discriminate MPS sequencing errors from somatic mosaicism with statistical confidence.In this study, we first analysed the patterns of sequencing errors in NLRP3 coding exons at a single-residue resolution by MPS using a Roche 454 GS-FLX sequencer and then constructed an error rate map for each base position in the NLRP3 exons. Based on the error rate map, we could formulate a discrimination pipeline of somatic mosaicism from sequencing errors and thereby detect new somatic mosaicism in mutation-negative CINCA/NOMID patients, whose somatic mutations were subsequently confirmed by subcloning and Sanger sequencing. This approach can also be generally used to identify low-level somatic mosaicism in other genes.2. Patients and methods2.1. Patients and DNA materialsPatients were clinically diagnosed with CAPS by their referring physicians and the NLRP3 gene was examined using the conventional Sanger sequencing method. DNA samples were obtained from Japanese NLRP3 somatic mosaic patients (n = 5) who have been previously described,9,13 CAPS patients (n = 5) with heterozygous NLRP3 mutations, and healthy donors (n = 50). Genomic DNA samples from mutation-negative CINCA/NOMID patients (n = 10) were obtained from the National Institute of Health, Bethesda, USA. To generate DNA samples with no mosaicism, we constructed a set of subcloned plasmids containing each exon and its flanking intronic regions in the NLRP3 gene from healthy donor genomic DNA using a Topo TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA). The cloned plasmids containing each exon and the flanking regions were validated by Sanger sequencing. Written informed consent was obtained from all the patients and their families. The study was approved by the ethical committees of Kyoto University and Kazusa DNA Research Institute and was conducted in accordance with the Helsinki Declaration.2.2. MPS of NLRP3 gene ampliconsGenomic DNA samples were extracted from whole blood or peripheral blood mononuclear cells as previously described. We used a two-step PCR assay and pooled sample libraries for MPS. To cover the entire NLRP3 coding exonic regions and flanking intronic regions, 14 amplicons were designed to be as long as an average read length for a 454 GS-FLX sequencer (up to 450 bases) and then amplified from each genomic DNA sample (Fig. 1A). The sequences of the PCR primers that were used to generate these 14 amplicons are provided in Supplementary Table S1. The upper and lower amplicon-specific primer sequences were flanked by common 15-base adapter sequences (TGTAAAACGACGGCC and GGAAACAGCTATGAC for the upper and lower primers, respectively) at the 5' end in order to fuse the primer-binding sequence for MPS in the second-step PCR. The first PCR amplifications were performed in 50-µl reactions using 30 ng of genomic DNA, 1× PrimeSTAR GXL buffer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 12.5 pmol of each forward and reverse primer, and 1.25 U of PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan). The thermal cycling profile consisted of an initial denaturation step at 98°C for 1 min, followed by 28–32 cycles of 10 s denaturation at 98°C, 15 s of annealing at 60°C, and a 30 s extension at 68°C. The lengths of the PCR products ranged from 291 to 421 bp. The second PCR amplifications were performed using primers with adapter sequences at the 3' end and Multiplex Identi<U+FB01>er (MID) sequences at the 5' end (Fig. 1B), which was used as a tag for each sample. The PCR reactions were performed in 50-µl volumes using 0.5 µl of the first PCR products, 1× PrimeSTAR GXL buffer, 0.2 mM of each dNTP, 12.5 pmol of each forward and reverse primer, and 1.25 U of PrimeSTAR GXL DNA polymerase to attach the anchor sequences for MPS. The thermal cycling profile consisted of an initial denaturation step at 98°C for 20 s, followed by 20 cycles of 10 s denaturation at 98°C, 15 s of annealing at 60°C, and a 40 s extension at 68°C.

All amplicons were ampli<U+FB01>ed by emPCR and sequenced together in a multiplex fashion. MPS on this platform was performed as instructed by Roche. The sequencing reads from each of the pooled libraries were identified by their MID tags.2.3. Sequence data analysisThe sequence read data were generated using GS RunProcessor ver.2.5.3 with default settings. Reads were sorted according to the MID tag sequences and were mapped to the reference amplicon sequences using the BLAT program14 with the ‘-fine’ option. In order to identify positions where the bases in a read differed from those in the reference sequence, each read was aligned to its reference sequence with the dpAlign module in the BioPerl package (http://www.bioperl.org/). The 454 pyrosequencing-related errors were categorized as insertions, deletions, mismatches, or ambiguous base calls. When aligning sequences, insertions/deletions are allocated based on the sequence context and strand orientation. To eliminate alignment artefacts due to insertion/deletion positions, the lower strand reads were converted to the reverse complement sequence, i.e. keeping the same strandness as the upper strand reads, when aligned with the reference sequence. A sequence error was defined as discordance in an equivalent position between the reference and control (from the 49 healthy individuals and a cloned plasmid vector). The error rate for a specified category was defined as the number of errors divided by the total number of bases in a read. The error rates of a base position on each strand were calculated from 50 control samples.2.4. Confirmation of somatic mosaicism of the NLRP3 gene by subcloning and subsequent capillary DNA sequencingTo confirm the somatic mutational frequency that was identified based on the 454 sequencing data, we subcloned the PCR products and performed capillary DNA sequencing as previously described.9 A Topo TA cloning kit (Invitrogen, San Diego, CA, USA) was used to subclone each of the 14 amplicons.2.5. Functional analysisTo determine whether the identified NLRP3 mutants are disease-causing, we assessed both ASC [apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a caspase recruitment domain; PYCARD, an approved symbol from the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) database]-dependent NF-<U+03BA>B activation in HEK293FT cells and transfection-induced cell death in THP-1 cells, a human monocytic cell line, as previously described.9,13,15 cDNAs encoding carboxy-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged NLRP3 and its mutants were subcloned into pcDNA5/TO (Invitrogen). Before being introduced into THP-1 cells (106) using a Cell Line Nucleofector Kit V (Amaxa Biosystems, Cologne, Germany), phorbol myristate acetate (10 ng/ml) was added to enhance transient expression of NLRP3 gene with minimizing spontaneous cell death.15 Four hours after the introduction of plasmids (0.5 µg), cell death of GFP-positive THP-1 cells was measured by flow cytometry.Expression plasmids for NLRP3 and ASC in the pEF-BOS vector background have been previously described.13 HEK293FT cells (105) were transfected using TransIT-293 Transfection Reagent (Milus Bio, Madison, WI, USA) with an NF-<U+03BA>B reporter construct (pNF-<U+03BA>B-luc; 20 ng; BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA, USA), an internal control construct (pRL-TK; 5 ng; Toyo Ink, Tokyo, Japan), and wild-type or mutant NLRP3 expression plasmid (20 ng) in the presence or absence of ASC expression plasmid (20 ng). The amounts of total plasmid DNA used for transfection experiments were kept constant by adding pEF-BOS vector DNA. Twenty-four hours later, the transfected cells were harvested and subjected to dual luciferase assay by which the ability of each construct to induce NF-<U+03BA>B activation was assessed as previously described.93. Results3.1. Construction of base- and strand-specific error rate maps of NLRP3 exons from the MPS data of 50 control samplesErrors in sequence reads generated by a Roche 454 GS-FLX sequencer are not randomly distributed along the sequence and depend on various factors.16 Although this is a well-known characteristic of 454 sequencing, the occurrence pattern of these errors has not been explored in detail simply because these sequencing errors are considered noise that can be filtered out in most cases. However, it is highly critical to understand the occurrence pattern of sequencing errors on the MPS platform because low-level somatic mosaicism might appear at a rate close to that of sequencing errors. To address this, we collected ~1 million sequence reads using the 454 GS-FLX sequencer for 14 amplicons of NLRP3 exons from 50 control samples that were thought to be free from somatic mosaicism, and ~94% of those reads were mapped to one of the reference NLRP3 exon sequences. The number of sequencing depths for each amplicon of each sample on each strand was between 65 and 2139 (mean = 565.3, Supplementary Table S2). We found that the average error rate for each mutation category (insertion, deletion, mismatch, and ambiguous base calls) at each base position on each strand of the amplicons in the control samples was 0.22, 0.16, 0.036, and 0.014%, respectively (Fig. 1C). These values were consistent with those reported in a recent study on the error rates with 454 sequencing data.16 The sequencing error in the 454 GS-FLX system tends to occur at the beginning and end of the reads,11,16 and we confirmed this trend in our amplicon sequencing data (Supplementary Fig. S1). Moreover, after removing the end regions of the read sequences, we found that the error rates of the target regions for each category were 0.20, 0.134, 0.023, and 0.014%, respectively (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Table S3). When generating the amplicon sequences for the NLRP3 exons, the target sequence (CDS region and flanking intron in 10-bp length) was designed to be 300-400 bp and not adjacent to primer sequences in order to obtain relatively low sequencing error rates (Fig. 1C). However, when the base- and strand-specific error rates of the respective amplicons were compared, we noticed that there were large variations in the error rate among amplicons in a strand-specific manner (Fig. 1D). We further examined the occurrence pattern of sequencing errors, as shown in Fig. 1E; the average sequencing error rates at each base in the 50 control amplicons are shown in a bar graph, where the bars in the upper or lower direction show the sequence error rates at the base position on the upper or lower strand of the amplicons, respectively. As evident in Fig. 1E, the error rates at most residues were low (<1%) with some hotspots for each type of error. Most of the insertion/deletion errors preferentially occurred at a homonucleotide region (yellow regions in Fig. 1E) as previously described,17 but it was not always the case for all of homonucleotide regions. We could not find any tight relationship between other sequence patterns and the error rate. In addition, there was almost no position where sequencing errors occurred at a similar rate on both strands. This is more clearly shown in Fig. 1F, which indicates the numbers of positions with sequence variations in both strands that were higher than the threshold along the horizontal axis. These results indicate that the sequence errors can be discriminated from real genetic alterations when the sequence is read in both directions. However, it is important to keep in mind that PCR errors are not distinct from real genetic alterations. We did not observe any base substitution at a rate higher than 1% in our experiments (Fig. 1F), and the overall PCR error rate under MPS conditions was lower than 1% as long as a high-fidelity DNA polymerase was used to generate the amplicons.Because Gilles et al.16 recently reported that the occurrence of sequencing errors using the Roche 454 GS-FLX DNA sequencer depends on various factors, we first examined variations in the sequencing error rates of NLRP3 exons among samples in the same run. For each mutation category, we found a similar trend in the error distribution rate in the amplicon sequences among the control samples (Supplementary Figs S2–S4). We confirmed that, for almost all residues, the error rate distributions among the 50 control samples fitted a Poisson distribution (data not shown). We next examined the run-to-run variation of the sequencing error rate for NLRP3 exons. For this purpose, we performed an additional MPS run with seven amplicons (exons 3, 4, and 6) that were newly prepared and compared the number and positions of the sequencing errors between two independent sequencing runs. Out of 1993 base positions in the target regions, there was a low occurrence rate of mismatch errors in both runs and this seemed to fit a Poisson distribution. However, insertion/deletion errors (>1% error rate) were observed at ~100 base positions (<5% in the target regions) in each run, and only a half of these errors were shared between both runs (Table 1). This indicated that the occurrence of insertion/deletion errors was considerably affected by the run conditions (probably due to variations in the absolute signal strengths of pyrosequencing). Thus, as previously reported, the detection of insertion/deletion mutations by MPS on the 454 GS-FLX system was quite error-prone at least at a limited number of residues. However, the results also implied that false-positive mosaic mutations could be avoided by considering the sequencing data for both strands because these run-dependent insertion/deletion errors occur only in a single strand. Taken together, we conclude that the obtained sequence error map is stable and sufficiently robust to discriminate substitution sequencing errors from low-level mosaicism. Run-to-run variations in the error occurrence (>1% frequency)aThe number of positions where the error rates in each category were commonly >1% for both strands in two independent runs.Run-to-run variations in the error occurrence (>1% frequency)aThe number of positions where the error rates in each category were commonly >1% for both strands in two independent runs.3.2. Discrimination formula for detection of somatic mosaicism with statistical confidenceWe next examined known SNPs, known heterozygous mutations and somatic mosaic mutations of CAPS patients using MPS. All of these variations appeared on both strands at the expected allele frequencies as shown in Fig. 2, again indicating that filtering the strand-specific sequence variations is unlikely to eliminate real genetic variations. Scatter plot of the observed frequency variation in both strands. The colours depict known SNPs (green), heterozygous and mosaic mutations (orange) and errors (grey).Scatter plot of the observed frequency variation in both strands. The colours depict known SNPs (green), heterozygous and mosaic mutations (orange) and errors (grey).For the mismatch error rate, we did not consider the type of base substituted in an amplicon position in this study. We took (1 - P) as a measure of the statistical confidence of the data and conventionally set a threshold of the statistical confidence to be 99.9%. In other words, if P-value was <0.001, the sequence alteration was considered to be a real sequence variation, not an error. For the final identification of real genetic variation with low-level somatic mosaicism, we determined that both of the P-values for the ith residue in the upper and lower strands must be smaller than the threshold.To evaluate the lower detection limit for the allele frequencies of somatic mosaicism based on the statistical formulation shown above, we generated a series of known allele frequencies by diluting DNA from CAPS patients carrying heterozygous NLRP3 mutations (c.1043C>T, c.1316C>T, and c.1985T>C) with DNA from normal donors carrying the wild-type NLRP3 gene. In the dilution series, the mutant allele frequencies were adjusted to be 10, 5, 3, 2, 1, and 0.5% (Table 2). The data indicated that somatic mosaicism at these sites and at an allele frequency =1% could be convincingly detected with statistical significance (P< 0.001) if more than 350 reads for each strand were obtained for an amplicon. We also applied this statistical method to detect somatic mosaicism in patients with known low-level mosaic mutations described above and confirmed that all of the mutations could be detected with statistical significance without any false positives (data not shown).

Detection and characterization of NLRP3 somatic mosaicism using the MPS platformTo demonstrate the power of this approach in practice, we applied our new pipeline for 10 CINCA/NOMID patients in whom we failed to detect mutations in the NLRP3 gene using a conventional direct DNA sequencing approach. The mutations detected by the analysis formulated using the MPS platform in this study are listed in Table 3. We successfully identified four out of the 10 patients with NLRP3 somatic mosaicism, which was confirmed by subcloning and Sanger sequencing. The nucleotide substitutions were as follows (parentheses indicate the corresponding amino acid change): c.907G>C (p.Asp303His), c.1699G>A (p.Glu567Lys) in two patients, and c.906C>A (p.Phe302Leu). The frequencies of mosaicism identified in these patients by the MPS approach were consistent with those that were identified by the subcloning and subsequent capillary DNA sequencing method (data not shown). Both c.907G>C and c.1699G>A variants were reported as CINCA/NOMID-associated mutations in Infevers database (http://fmf.igh.cnrs.fr/ISSAID/infevers/) and in the dbSNP database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP/).8Potential mosaic mutations detected in patients with unknown mutationsPotential mosaic mutations detected in patients with unknown mutationsBecause the NLRP3 p.Phe302Leu mutation was novel and not detected in the 50 healthy controls, we performed an in vitro functional analysis to see the effect of p.Phe302Leu on the protein function. We used two different in vitro transfection experiments, the rapid cell death in transfected THP-1 cells and the ASC-dependent NF-<U+03BA>B activation in transfected HEK293FT cells (Fig. 3A and B, respectively). Both assays clearly showed that p.Phe302Leu was a disease-causing mutation similar to known CINCA/NOMID-associated pathogenic mutations (p.Asp303His and p.Glu567Lys).9In vitro functional analysis of the identified NLRP3 mosaic mutations.

DiscussionAlthough the somatic mutation rate at the nucleotide level in vivo was difficult to quantitatively measure due to the complexity of the genome and laborious molecular detection processes, recent advances in MPS technologies have allowed us to directly quantitate somatic mutations in human genome.20–22 The current estimate for the somatic (de novo) mutation rate is 1–2 × 10-8 residues/generation/haploid, and this estimate is sufficiently low that we would expect to never observe somatic mosaicism in the NLRP3 gene by chance; although the error rate of the high-fidelity DNA polymerase used to produce the amplicons is two orders of magnitude larger than the somatic mutation rate,23,24 we could not detect PCR-generated mosaicism higher than 1% in the 454 sequencing error maps. Based on the literature, the single base substitutions are the most frequent type of somatic mutations (~500 times more frequent than short insertions/deletions)25 and protein-coding sequences are less mutagenic than sequences in non-coding regions, assuming that the somatic mutation spectrum in malignant cells is the same as in normal cells. Somatic mosaicism is thought to result from de novo gain-of-function-type mutations that are introduced at a very early and limited stage of development, and it is reasonable to focus our efforts on detecting base substitutions for somatic mosaicism in the NLRP3 gene.It is challenging but highly important in many areas of research, such as cancer, to detect low-level somatic mutations, which we designated as somatic mosaicism in this study, from apparently mutation-negative samples by conventional sequencing. Subcloning followed by the capillary DNA sequencing has been a de facto standard to identify somatic mosaicism, but this is not the method of choice for routine diagnostics because it is laborious, time consuming, and costly. Thus, it is reasonable for us to explore MPS as a new tool for this purpose. Although previous studies have used MPS technology to detect somatic mosaicism, it was unclear how sensitive this method is to detect a low-level somatic mosaicism using the MPS platform because this platform is generally error-prone. To address this challenge, we developed a new pipeline to detect low-level somatic mosaicism with statistical confidence using base position- and strand-specific error rate maps for the NLRP3 amplicons to be studied. Whereas the detection limit of somatic mosaicism depends on the base position and the read depth of the amplicons, the limit of detection could be as low as 1% allele frequency with no false positives for substitutions (the precision is higher than 99.9%). Our error map shows that 98.1% of base positions (3343 out of 3407 target positions) in the NLRP3 exonic amplicons can be detected with ~1% mosaicism when more than ~350 reads were accumulated for each strand. Although the remaining region (64 base positions out of 3407 target positions) was too error-prone (the error rate ranged from 0.1 to 1.7% in either the upper or lower strand) to detect low-level mosaicism by MPS, medium-level mosaicism (5% or high) could be identified in all base positions in the target region with the same significance level. Based on this pipeline, we successfully identified four cases of somatic mosaicism among 10 apparently mutation-negative CINCA/NOMID patients. These results were subsequently confirmed by functional analysis and subcloning followed by capillary DNA sequencing method.As described above, we revealed that a read depth of ~350 for each strand of each amplicon would be sufficient to detect somatic mosaicism as low as 1% with statistical confidence. This means that an analysis of somatic mosaicism (detection limit of 1% allele frequency) of the NLRP3 gene for one sample requires 350 × 2 × 14 = 9800 reads with the 454 GS-FLX sequencer, which has a capacity to obtain 1 000 000 reads per run. Thus, we could analyse ~100 patient samples with a single run (~10 h) using this MPS platform. For this purpose, a miniaturized 454 sequencer might be more convenient because it could analyse 10 patient samples at once with a reasonably reduced running cost.The approach used to detect somatic mosaicism is very similar to that for low-frequency alleles in pooled DNA samples, for which MPS applications have been reported by many groups.18,26,27 However, the main aim of these previous studies was to screen for a rare allele in a population. Thus, the discovery phase on the MPS platform must be followed by an evaluation phase using conventional methods. Therefore, when diagnosing somatic mosaicism of the NLRP3 gene based solely on the MPS platform, we could not use the same approach to detect rare alleles in a population due to its low accuracy. The sequencing error rate on the Roche MPS platform was sufficiently stable and low enough as shown in this study. Using our pipeline, we were able to detect 1% somatic mosaicism in the NLRP3 gene with 99.9% confidence. Although another research group recently used a similar approach with a short-read MPS,28 the Roche long-read MPS is more suitable as a diagnostic tool mainly because of the short run time. If we could diagnose somatic mosaicism of the NLRP3 gene within a reasonable time with low labour and costs as shown in this study, the success rate of CINCA/NOMID genetic diagnosis will increase from 60 to 80% or higher,9 which will greatly advance the health and care of these patients and prevent irreversible bone and neurological complications of disease.This pipeline would also be efficient to detect somatic mosaicism in mutation-negative patients with other diseases, including cancer. The error rate map for a given gene should be constructed from authentic plasmids, and used to detect somatic mosaicism of other genes as well as rare alleles in various populations.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study was supported by the Japanese Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, and Culture, and the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labor, and Welfare.We thank all patients who participated in the study.

IntroductionThe WRKY family is one of the 10 largest transcription factor families in higher plants and extends all over the green lineage.1 WRKY proteins possess one or two unique DNA-binding domain with nearly 60 amino acids composed of the absolutely conserved signature WRKYGQK followed by a novel zinc-finger-like motif C2H2 (C–X4–5–C–X22–23–H–X–H) or C2HC (C–X7–C–X23–H–X–C). As a transcription factor, WRKY factors act in concert with other components of the transcriptional machinery and direct the temporal- and spatial-specific expression of the designated genes, thereby ensuring proper cellular responses to both internal and external stimuli.1–3 The stimuli may be from abiotic, such as cold, heat, UV-B, drought, wound, etc., or may be from biotic, such as bacteria, fungi and viruses. As well, WRKY proteins have been implicated in the regulation of developmental processes such as trichome,4 seed development,5 embryogenesis,6 leaf senescence,7,8 dormancy,9 plant growth10 and metabolic pathways.4,11 Since the first WRKY cDNA, SPF1, was cloned from sweet potato (Ipomoeabatatas),12 more and more WRKY genes in various plant species have been experimentally identified, including wild oat (Avena fatua; ABF1),13 parsley (Petroselinum crispum; PcWRKY1, 2, 3),14,15Arabidopsis thaliana (ZAP1),16 orchardgrass (Dactylis glomerata),17 tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum),18–21 chamomile (Matricaria chamomilla),22 rice (Oryza sativa),23 sugarcane (Saccharum hybrid cultivar),24 bittersweet nightshade (Solanum dulcamara),25 potato (Solanum tuberosum),26,27 wheat (Triticum aestivum)28 and grape (Vitis vinifera).29Zea mays (hereafter called maize) is not only a vital crop, but also serves as an important model system for basic biological research.30,31 Due to its wide ecological potential and excellent characters, maize roots all over the world under a wide range of environmental conditions, occupying 167 million hectares worldwide and producing 872 million tons of grains in July, 2011 according to the USDA (http://www.fas.usda.gov/psdonline/). Recently, the maize B73 genome sequence is now available to public,32 providing a good opportunity to study WRKY transcription factor family extensively.To date, researchers are still active in this field to reveal the underlying molecular mechanism of WRKY proteins in plant growth and development, as well as to elucidate a huge interaction web involving in response to stresses which is mediated by this transcription factor family.33–38 The WRKY proteins in model plant A. thaliana (hereafter called Arabidopsis) have set a good example for later researchers to study the transcription factor family. In Arabidopsis, 72 characterized genes can be categorized into three groups based on the number of WRKY domains and the pattern of the zinc finger motif according to Somssich and colleagues.39 The first group contains two WRKY domains (N-terminal and C-terminal), whereas the other two groups have only one domain. Group III differs in the pattern of the zinc finger motif because it has the zinc finger motif of C2HC rather than C2H2 in the other groups. Group II proteins can be further subdivided into five subgroups according to the amino acid motifs outside the WRKY domain. All these preliminary knowledge might contribute to our understanding of maize WRKY gene family.In this study, we identified 136 WRKY proteins encoded by 119 WRKY genes from the maize B73 genome and named them from ZmWRKY1 to ZmWRKY119 based on their loci on corresponding chromosomes. Considering of the different transcripts produced by the same gene, totally 136 putative proteins are all named. These 136 WRKY proteins in maize can be classified into three groups in terms of the phylogenetic tree which is constructed using the WRKY domain peptide sequences. The phylogenetic comparisons of maize, Arabidopsis, O. sativa (hereafter called rice), Hordeum vulgare (hereafter called barley), Physcomitrella patens (hereafter called P. patens) and ancestral eukaryotic organisms reveal the origin and evolutionary expansion of the WRKY family. The maize chromosome sequence information derived from databases is applied to map the 136 WRKY transcripts to their corresponding gene locus in the 10 haploid chromosomes in order to investigate the duplication events occurred on maize chromosomes.Nowadays, a large number of maize microarray experiments are accessible via different public resources such as GEO or Plexdb, and allow for in silico expression analyses of maize genes. The microarray data of genome-wide gene expression atlas of the maize inbred line B73 offer the chance to understand the distinct expression patterns of the WRKY family under stresses response and growth and development. All these favourable conditions enable us to further our research and get a deep understanding of the roles of WRKY family members in maize.2. Materials and methods2.1. Identification and annotation of WRKY family in maizeSince the amended maize B73 genome sequence is now publicly available, we can download the genome sequence (ZmB73_5b_FGS_genes.fasta.gz) and the proteome sequence (ZmB73_5b_FGS_translations.fasta.gz) from the Maize Genome Sequence Project (http://ftp.maizesequence.org/current/filtered-set/). Then, local BLASTP program was run to search the complete WRKY members. The proteome sequences are used as a database for local BLASTP search. The Arabidopsis WRKY proteins are used as query sequences. The e-value for BLASTP was set at 1e-10 to obtain the final data set of WRKY proteins. After removing the overlapping genes manually, a total of 136 protein sequences are eventually identified as WRKY proteins and named based on their exact loci on chromosomes. The putative orthologues were assigned from Arabidopsis, rice and H. vulgare with significance under 1e-20 from National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI).2.2. Phylogenetic analysis of WRKY familyThe WRKY family protein sequences of rice (O. sativa japonica) and Arabidopsis were downloaded from TIGR rice database (http://www.tigr.org/) and TAIR (The Arabidopsis Information Resource; http://www.arabidopsis.org/), respectively. Sequences of barley and P. patens were extracted from NCBI. Maize sequences were identified by local BLASTP program as described above. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA version 540 with pairwise distance and Neighbor-Joining algorithm. The evolutionary distances were computed using the p-distance method and were used to estimate the number of amino acid substitutions per site. The reliability of each tree was established by conducting 1000 bootstrap sampling steps.2.3. Mapping WRKY genes on maize chromosomesThe maize databases were used in a BLAST-based search of the entire maize genomic sequence to confirm the physical locations of all WRKY genes. The Genome Pixelizer software was used for a graphical display of the WRKY loci in each pair of corresponding maize chromosomes (http://atgc.org/GenomePixelizer/41).2.4. Microarray-based expression analysisTranscriptome data of genome-wide gene expression atlas of the maize inbred line B73 made by NimbleGen microarray technology, together with the normalized expression data using RMA (robust multi-chip average) algorithm, were downloaded from the publicly available databases such as MaizePLEX (http://www.plexdb.org/plex.php?database=Corn) and GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). The RMA data which were log2-transformed beforehand were loaded into R and Bioconductor for expression analysis (http://www.bioconductor.org/42). The package Limma43,44 was used to model the systematic parts of data by fitting a linear model in the function lmFit. The model was specified by a design matrix. The empirical Bayes approach, in the function eBays, was used to moderate the standard errors of the estimated log-fold changes and shrink the standard errors to a common value. Then, the gplots45 package was used to make the heat map.3. Results and discussion3.1. Identification and nomenclature of 136 maize WRKY proteinsA keyword search against the NCBI and UniProt protein sequence databases returned 34 and 31 previously annotated maize WRKY protein sequences, respectively, by the year 2011; among which, 28 proteins are derived from the maize B73 inbred line (Supplementary Table S1). We greatly appreciate the foregoing efforts made by Alexandrov et al.46 and other scientists, who have named these sequences which were derived from a large-scale cDNA sequencing or from experiments individually. However, the annotations are so disordered and redundant, for they are named neither in chromosome order nor in the group order and the same numbers occur repeatedly, which make research work difficult to go ahead. A uniform nomenclature with consecutive numbering may help avoid confusion and should help communicate in the scientific community. Thus, we renamed the 136 protein sequences which we have identified through an overall search of the complete genome sequence from ZmWRKY1 to ZmWRKY119 based on the exact position of their corresponding genes on chromosomes 1–10 and from top to bottom, while the variant proteins produced from the same locus are recognized by the same name added 1, 2 or 3 behind (Supplementary Table S2). We use the similar numbering system as proposed for bZIP47 and R2R3-MYB,48 provides a unique identifier for each WRKY gene. Genes in different genomes that evolved from a common ancestral gene by speciation can be considered as orthologous genes,49 which retain the similar functions during evolution.50 As a good plant for experiments, Arabidopsis, together with monocotyledonous plants rice and barley, is used to assign orthology for maize, which is valuable for functional analysis of the WRKY family members in maize. The putative orthologues are identified according to their e-value (under 1e-20) and the topology of phylogenetic tree.3.2. Evolutionary analysis of the WRKY transcription factor familyExposed to a wide variety of biotic and abiotic stresses connected with plant sessile, autotrophic lifestyle, the WRKY family appears to have been under positive selection pressure during evolution. To study the evolutionary origin of maize WRKY family and classify the newly discovered members, multiple sequence alignment is performed using the complete domain sequences derived from Arabidopsis (71),39 maize (136), rice (82),51,52 barley (36)53 and P. patens (36). Because of the difference between the C- and the N-terminal WRKY domain sequences of Group I, which will be described later, we separate them as two independent domains. Then the alignment result is used to generate a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1). The result shows a well-organized classification according to that in Arabidopsis.39 Here, we call them Group I, IIa–e and III. Unrooted Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic tree of WRKY domains in five plants. The tree is reconstructed using WRKY domain sequences from the complete WRKY gene families in A. thaliana (yellow), Z. mays (B73, brown), O. sativa (blue), H. vulgare (green) and P. patens (khaki). The evolutionary distances are computed using the p-distance method and are in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site.Unrooted Neighbor-Joining phylogenetic tree of WRKY domains in five plants. The tree is reconstructed using WRKY domain sequences from the complete WRKY gene families in A. thaliana (yellow), Z. mays (B73, brown), O. sativa (blue), H. vulgare (green) and P. patens (khaki). The evolutionary distances are computed using the p-distance method and are in the units of the number of amino acid substitutions per site.The result of phylogenetic analysis implies that domain gain and loss is a divergent force for expansion of the WRKY gene family. It has been reported that WRKY transcription factors have their evolutionary origin in ancient eukaryotes with the most basal WRKY genes identified in two non-photosynthetic organisms, the unicellular protist Giardia lamblia and the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum.54 Each ancestral eukaryotic organism has single WRKY protein which belongs to Group I because of the two WRKY domains, suggesting that the proteins of this group evolved early and represent the ancestral form. Except AtWRKY10, all WRKY proteins of Group I in Arabidopsis have two WRKY domains. But in monocotyledons, the loss of WRKY domain seems to be more common. For example, Supplementary Fig. S1 shows that Group I contains 16 proteins having only one domain, among which 9 proteins possess the C-terminal domain and the rest with the N-terminal domain only. In addition, some proteins with two domains are clustered into Group III according to the phylogenetic tree, which are OsWRKY41, OsWRKY61, OsWRKY63, OsWRKY81 and HvWRKY25. As the phenomenon occurs in monocotyledons exclusively, the result shows that there exists a divergence between monocot, and demonstrates that Group III proteins emerged later during evolution and maybe evolved from Group I.The early researches have reported that only the C-terminal domain in Group I has the sequence-specific DNA-binding activity with the W-box, and N-terminal WRKY domain shows weaker binding activity.3,16,55 The first solution structure of the WRKY domain was AtWRKY4_C (PDB: 1WJ2), obtained by NMR spectroscopy, which confirmed the reports described above.56 Further, DNA titration experiment proved that the region corresponding to the conserved sequence WRKYGQK in WRKY4-C is directly involved in DNA binding. In contrast, the N-terminal WRKY domain might participate in the binding process or alternatively provide an interface for protein–protein interactions that coincide with the function of some zinc-finger-like domains.57 In this scenario, we can reasonably assume that the N-terminal WRKY domain seems to be more variable during evolution, so it may be deleted from the sequence or evolve into another pattern to achieve additional functions. Meanwhile, it can be of no question that the single WRKY domains of Groups II and III family members are more similar to the C-terminal WRKY domain of Group I proteins for their common function of DNA binding.A large number of WRKY proteins exist in the five species, suggesting that they play crucial roles in plant developmental and physiological processes (Table 1).58 The evidence shows that the rapid duplication of WRKY genes occurred before the divergence of monocots and dicots.54 It might be the environmental pressures that impelled WRKY family to enlarge in order to adapt to new or changing environments. In G. lamblia and D. discoideum, only a single WRKY protein has been discovered. And then, in bryophyte, the family member of P. patens has increased to 37 by duplication. There is no related report about the members of Group III in P. patens ever before. However, on the basis of the complete genome sequencing and the topology of the phylogenetic tree, five proteins are found to group into Group III. To angiosperm, monocotyledonous plants develop a larger family of WRKY proteins than dicotyledonous plants. One hundred and thirty-six maize WRKY proteins form the largest WRKY family, while those of rice ranks second, only 71 WRKY members in Arabidopsis. With plants from low to higher and from aquatic environment to terrestrial environment, plants suffering severer stresses shut down basic growth functions, while WRKY proteins may act synergistically with other family members to promote plant development and reinforce resistance to environment stressors by modulating the expression of genes. As an important transcription factors, the rapid duplication of WRKY family members may contribute to the increase in adaptability and the establishment of signal transduction webs to go through the adversity.

Chromosome mapping and genetic analysisThere are 10 chromosomes in maize genome and the length of each chromosome varies from each other. The first chromosome is the longest with 301.0 Mb, and the last is the shortest which is only half of the longest. According to the physical and genetic framework of the maize B73 genome, the 10 chromosomes of the maize genome are structurally diverse and have undergone dynamic changes in chromatin composition.30,32 Mapping genes to individual chromosome can facilitate the elimination of redundant data, and provide a powerful analytical method to conduct genetic research. In order to map 119 WRKY genes to maize chromosomes, the physical location of each gene was required. Many searches are performed in the interest of finding gene orientation and genetic distance of corresponding WRKY genes against maize-related databases. Finally, the software GenomePixelizer was used to visualize the distribution of all WRKY genes on maize 10 chromosomes. The genes are presented by small colour boxes, and the different colours mean different groups and subgroups of the WRKY gene family.The physical distribution of WRKY genes in the maize B73 genome illustrates the genetic events which result in the diversity and complexity of this gene family. The study of chromosome map (Supplementary Fig. S2) along with the histogram (Fig. 2) comes to the conclusion that the WRKY genes are dispersedly distributed across all the chromosomes in maize. The highest number of WRKY genes is located on Chromosome 8 (24 genes), accounting for 20.17% of the total. The chromosome having least number is Chromosome 9, with only four genes belonging to three different groups, accounting for just 3.36% of the total. The members of three groups are distributed on all chromosomes except Chromosome 5 on which WRKY genes of Group II are located exclusively. Without regard to Chromosome 5, the distribution of Group I genes in each chromosome is more even than that of Groups II and III, with the number of genes ranging from 2 to 3. The formation of this distribution pattern implies that some genetic events of this gene family have taken place during evolution. Histogram showing the number and distribution of WRKY genes of three groups on 10 chromosomes.Histogram showing the number and distribution of WRKY genes of three groups on 10 chromosomes.The analysis of genetics and genomics has offered insights into the generation and the evolution of WRKY genes. Evidences have shown that the dramatic variations in size and distribution of the WRKY gene family are influenced by many processes, including gene duplication owing to large-scale genome events such as polyploidy, segmental duplications and tandem duplication.59,60 An important fact is that maize genome has undergone several rounds of genome duplication, including an ancient paleopolyploid event ~70 million years ago (mya)61 and an additional whole-genome duplication event ~11 mya.31,62,63 Furthermore, many studies have revealed that transcriptional factors are more likely to retain after duplication.64–66 All these suggest that genome duplication might be a major mechanism for expansion of WRKY family in maize. Our inference can be confirmed by another gramineous plant, rice, in which the WRKY family comprises ~77.7% duplicated regions.67 Most WRKY genes show clustering in maize genome. Here, we adopted the standpoint proposed by Meyers et al.68 to define a cluster that the numbers or sizes of clusters changed little when the maximum number of intervening open-reading frames (ORFs) increased to 20 or even 50. Therefore, two or more WRKY genes that occurred within a maximum of 40 ORFs were identified as a cluster in this study. Totally, 47 WRKY genes forming 20 gene clusters distribute dispersedly on the overall chromosomes except Chromosomes 5 and 9 (Supplementary Table S3). The remaining 72 genes are singletons. Strikingly, Chromosome 8 not only owns the most of WRKY genes but also possesses nearly half of gene clusters. In general, we can classify the clusters into three kinds. In the first kind, eight gene clusters form monophyletic tandem duplications with non-WRKY genes intervening, including seven clusters in Group III and one in subgroup IIa. In the second kind, seven clusters are made up of four subgroups except IIa, forming three types of gene pairs. Among them, three are II-b, c pair type; three II-c, e pair and one II-d, e pair. The third kind is mixed by two groups. Beyond that, the rest singletons maybe occurred by random events.According to Xu et al.,69 if two closed related genes which are located within the same chromosomal region apart from each other fewer than 20 genes can be reckoned as tandem duplication. In this scenario, 16 tandem duplications in our study are inside the gene cluster regions. Interestingly, ZmWRKY78 and ZmWRKY91 are the same gene distributed on Chromosomes 7 and 8, respectively, which may suggest the occurrence of segmental duplication event in maize WRKY family during evolution. The increased number of WRKY genes correlates closely with the frequency of duplication events, and these duplications may be responsible for the maintenance of transcriptional regulation activity. More copies of one gene will contribute to offset the effects of mutations and help the plants to survive adversity.3.4. Expression analysis of WRKY factors in global transcriptome at different developmental stages and in specific organsResearches have revealed a multiple roles of WRKY factors in response to abiotic stresses, including drought and salt, which is regarded as an ancestral role of WRKY proteins,4 and biotic stresses such as bacteria and fungi. Elucidating the functions of WRKY family members require great endeavour. Microarray is one of the useful global transcriptome analysis technologies which provides an opportunity to understand the patterns of gene expression. Many expression data generated by microarrays are publicly available in microarray databases, such as GEO and ArrayExpress, which provide valuable resources for gene discovery and functional characterization. We mine the gene expression data under drought stress shown in Supplementary Fig. S3 and during Ustilago maydis infection shown in Supplementary Fig. S4.The gene expression profiling of 31 ZmWRKYs was compared between the drought-tolerant line Han21 and the drought-sensitive line Ye478 (Supplementary Fig. S3). Interestingly, we can notice that the gene expression levels of the drought-tolerant line Han21 in generally change less than that of the drought-sensitive line Ye478 and recovered more quickly when the seedlings were re-watered. We can see that the expression of ZmWRKY115 is apparently decreased under drought stress, which may be a response to the increased ABA level resulting from drought. Simultaneously, some genes show a cumulative trend under drought, such as ZmWRKY 15.1, -46, -52 and –77. Interestingly, ZmWRKY 90 in the drought-sensitive line Ye478 tend to be expressed at higher mRNA abundances under any conditions. Meanwhile, many WRKY proteins are recognized as pathogen-induced transcription factors and active in immune response such as AtWRKY18, AtWRKY22, AtWRKY29, AtWRKY53, AtWRKY54 and AtWRKY70. Supplementary Figure S4 displays the expression levels of maize WKRY genes during infection with U. maydis. Compared with the mock stimulus, most of the ZmWRKYs exhibit a gradual increase in expression levels with the prolonging of infection time. For example, the ZmWRKY78 and 91 are two orthologues of AtWRKY53 which are activated by the pathogen-triggered SA signalling pathway, showing an obvious increasing trend during the infection with U. maydis. AtWRKY70 functions as an activator of SA-dependent defence genes and a repressor of JA-regulated genes, and the expression levels of its orthologue, ZmWRKY115, are also apparently increased upon the fungal infection, implying a parallel function in defence response.It is of great significance to study the expression patterns and regulative mechanisms of WRKYs in stress responses. However, in the work described here, we mainly focus on the spatial and temporal specific expression patterns of maize WRKY genes in order to identify their roles in developmental regulation, as the expression of WRKY genes was detected in a wide variety of plant species and is involved in plant growth and development.5,70–71 In this case, we mined microarray data that record the gene expression levels of 60 distinct tissues representing 11 major organ systems and varying developmental stages of the maize (Supplementary Table S4). The organ systems included the germinating seed, primary root, whole seedling, stem and shoot apical meristem, internodes, cob, tassel and anthers, silk, leaf, husk and seed.A total number of 131 probes detected in R could be assigned to 131 corresponding ZmWRKY transcripts (Supplementary Table S5). The remaining five transcripts with no detectable expression signal are ZmWRKY25.1, ZmWRKY25.2, ZmWRKY25.3, ZmWRKY32 and ZmWRKY102. There are three major reasons for why their signals cannot be detected. First, the different versions of the official maize genome sequence are used in the study. The version of B73 maize genome that are used to map probe set design sequences on the microarray is 5a (RefGen_v2), whereas the version we used to identify the complete WRKY family is 5b (RefGen_v2). The second plausible explanation is that these genes are very specific to organs or developmental stages which are not covered in these experiments so that no signal intensities are detected on the microarray. Last, it is also possible that these genes could be stress-inducible or pseudogenes. In order to investigate the temporal and spatial transcription patterns of the WRKY genes in maize life cycle, a hierarchy cluster was performed to visualize global transcription profile of the WRKY genes across the 60 developmental stages, and the results were illustrated as a heat map (Supplementary Fig. S5).It can be seen from the heat map that all of the 131 detected transcripts produced by 116 genes are involved in many biological processes, and expressed in all tissues, but their expression levels are distinct. Most of the genes appear to be invariable and lowly expressed among all tissues. Interestingly, the reference gene encoding E2 enzyme is the most stably and highly expressed across maize life, for which is known as a component in the ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation pathway. The stable gene expression across all tissues can be regarded as constitutive expression, and we can infer that many maize WRKY genes were expressed at low level, which may work synergistically with other family proteins during plant growth and development.In order to investigate the differential expression patterns, especially fluctuating patterns, in different developmental stages and diverse tissues, we calculate the coefficient of variation (CV value; CV = sd/mean, where sd and mean represent the standard deviation and mean expression level of a gene across all the tissues, respectively) of each gene in 60 tissues accurately (Fig. 3), and the results show that the CV values of these genes range from 2 to 28% (Supplementary Table S6). Those with a CV value of <15% are considered to be the least expression variability.73 Consequently, total 102 transcripts are stably expressed across all tissues. In contrast, the CV values of the rest 29 transcripts are >15%, which indicate the existence of stage-specific gene expression during development. As we know that WRKY factors can act as either negative or positive regulators in gene expressions thus we are more concerned about the dynamic changes in gene expression during the development of major maize organs. Therefore, we highlight the genes with a CV value of >15% and explore their expression levels among the distinct organs in order to find the organ-specific genes in maize (data see Supplementary Table S5).

Normalized signal intensities of 131 ZmWRKY transcripts are displayed (according to MaizePlex), and corresponding ZmWRKY transcripts are presented on the x-axis with the order according to the groups. The transcripts with CV =15% are represented by a tiny hollow circle.

The transcripts with CV =15% are represented by a tiny hollow circle. The reference gene which encodes E2 enzyme is shown as a small square.The 11 organ systems can be further subdivided into single tissues which represent the gradual developmental process to some extent. Figure 4 shows the expression levels of the 29 maize WRKY genes in 60 tissues with a CV value of >15%. We ordered the transcripts based on their groups in order to find differential expression between groups. And as expected, genes in the same group appear to share the similar expression patterns as a whole, while about half of 29 WRKY gene expressions show that variation could be generated by different organ types. Expression of ZmWRKY92 appears to be accumulated in the late-development leaves stage. Both ZmWRKY116.2 and ZmWRKY116.3 are highly expressed in the anther and silk, and also highly increased in early whole seed after pollination and before the formation of the endosperm and embryo. Notably, ZmWRKY28 in IIc is remarkably expressed in the stem and SAM, internode, and cob and tassel, and its expression level is gradually changed in consistent with the development of the relevant organs. ZmWRKY68 is highly expressed in late-development leaf and husk. It is notable that there is no gene detected in IId with a CV value of >15%. ZmWRKY39 in subgroup IIe is highly expressed in the primary root, and late leaf and husk. However, the WRKY genes in Group III display a leaf-specific gene expression. Besides, the expression of ZmWRKY78 and ZmWRKY91 may also be specific in the pericarp while ZmWRKY115 perhaps plays a special role in early whole seed. In addition to the highly expressed genes in specific organs, the genes with significant low expression levels may also have effects on the development of given organs. Most of the genes are likely to be stably expressed at low levels in the development of the endosperm and embryo, suggesting that they are not stage-specific and tissue-specific expression.

The line graph in Fig. 5 will do a great help to observe the interest genes and analyse their dynamic changing processes clearly. We use E2 enzyme as an external reference and ZmWRKY23 and ZmWRKY105 as internal references to show the constitutively high expression and constitutively low expression, respectively. It is very interesting that ZmWRKY12 and ZmWRKY28 form an arc line, respectively, revealing their important roles in the development of the stem and shoot apical meristems, and the internode and cob, and ZmWRKY12 is also highly expressed in the pericarp. ZmWRKY56 has the highest expression level in the germinating seed, while ZmWRKY113 shows a fluctuating pattern of expression during the development of the leaf.

ConclusionsData acquisition of WRKY transcription factor family is the initial step to go on our analysis of the gene family. Meanwhile, numbering and annotating the identified genes are also of great importance for classification and function characterization. However, a big block stand on our way is the existing identifiers in databases. In database like NCBI, the data of maize WRKY are submitted from large-scale sequencing or experiments individually. The numbering of these data is disorder and redundant ineluctably, and also the data are from several different maize lines, so the numbering system may be diverse and lineage-specific. As the maize B73 genome has been sequenced, we propose to number from chromosomes 1 to 10 and from top to bottom, which can help avoid confusion and promote communication. On this occasion, we give the 136 putative proteins uniform identifier.Among the 136 WRKY proteins we have identified, 27 proteins belong to Group I, 78 proteins are contained in Group II and 31 proteins are members of Group III. The classification system is based on the features of WRKY domains which can be regarded as evolutionary unit. The sequence divergence usually goes with functional difference in the course of evolution. And it is the divergence of both expression and protein sequence that makes the lineage-specific expansion. Thus, we can conclude that proteins from different groups may accomplish diverse functions.The comparative analysis of orthologues may help us obtain the information of the evolutionary relationships among the gene family members and help us predict the potential functions of putative proteins. The high-throughput screening method identified that AtWRKY53 is expressed at a very early time point of leaf senescence.8 Not only AtWRKY53, AtWRKY4, -6, -7 and -11 in Arabidopsis play a role in leaf development.39 Among the WRKY genes with the CV value of >15%, ZmWRKY116.2, -116.3 are orthologues of AtWRKY4, and ZmWRKY77, -78, -91 are orthologues of AtWRKY53. However, their functions seem to diverge from each other. As seen in the heat map, ZmWRKY77, -78 -91 are highly expressed in the leaf and present a gradual cumulative trend, implying a regulatory role of these genes in leaf development, especially in the early stage of leaf senescence. While the specific expression of ZmWRKY116.2 and -116.3 emerge mainly in reproductive-related tissues, such as the anther and silk. In addition, ZmWRKY116.2 and -116.3 are also orthologues of AtWRKY44 which are associated with the tannin and mucilage production in the seed coat.4,73 Thus, both genes in maize are expressed at a high level in the early development of the whole seed but not in the development of the endosperm and embryo. Endogenesis abscisic acid (ABA) is crucial in adversity responses as well as growth and development. During the late maturity, the seed enters into the dormant phase due to the increase of ABA. While after imbibition, ABA content usually rapidly decreases and the seed begins to germinate. This ABA-dependent progress of the seed germination and post-germination growth was mediated by AtWRKY2.72 In maize, ZmWRKY56 is the orthologue of AtWRKY2. Coincidently, ZmWRKY56 is highly expressed in the germinating seed after 24 h imbibition, suggesting a similar function of these two orthologues. It has been proved that AtWRKY40 functions as a central negative regulator of ABA signalling in seed germination and post-germination,36 while its orthologues in maize seem insensitive to drought stress in our study.By means of the microarrary-based data mining and homologous analysis, we can obtain much useful information about the putative functions of the WRKYs in maize. It is of great importance to elucidate the biological functions of these transcription factors and provide us deeper understanding in molecular mechanisms of corn growth development and adversity resistance.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe project was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China (Grant No. B0810040).We are grateful to the providers who submitted the microarray data to the public expression databases which can be applied freely.Supplementary data"

Functional characterization of wheat unigenes by gene ontology annotation, mining transcription factors, full-length cDNA, and miRNA targeting sites were carried out. A bioinformatics strategy was developed to discover single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within our large EST resource and reported the SNPs between and within (homoeologous) cultivars. Digital gene expression was performed to find the tissue-specific gene expression, and correspondence analysis was executed to identify common and specific gene expression by selecting four biotic stress-related libraries. The assembly and associated information cater a framework for future investigation in functional genomics.1. IntroductionWheat provides 21% of food calories and 20% of protein to more than 4.5 billion people worldwide.1 Demand for wheat in the developing world is projected to increase 60% by 2050. At the same time, climate change-induced temperature increases are estimated to reduce wheat production by 29%.2The advent of new molecular genetic technology and the dramatic increase in plant gene sequence data have provided opportunities to underpin wheat breeding programmes in order to improve yield, grain quality, and disease resistance.3 Many of these technologies have been designed to facilitate detection and understanding of the alterations in gene expression that accompany differential development or that result from the perception of changes to the environment. Expressed sequence tag (EST) projects provide a very useful and quick means of accessing gene sequence and expression information. When combined with breakthroughs in highly parallel designs for gene expression analysis, large-scale EST projects now offer new perspectives for understanding the molecular basis of important traits in plants of agricultural relevance.4 EST sequencing projects have been completed or are under way for many plant species. These projects have provided useful tools for intragenomic5 and intergenomic6 comparisons, gene discovery,7–9 molecular marker identification,10 microarray development,11–15 and polyploid species genomic resource development.16–18 As robot throughput increases and cost-per-read drops, determination of a sequence tag for a large proportion of genes is now reasonable using this random cDNA sequencing approach. For example, the availability of the complete genome sequence of Arabidopsis thaliana revealed that the 105 000 ESTs available at the end of 2000 were enough to tag 60% of the 25 500 genes.19 The complete genome sequences of several plant species are known and the rate at which whole genomes are being sequenced is increasing. Correct annotation of these genomes remains problematic despite gene prediction algorithms becoming ever more sophisticated. While wheat genome sequencing is rapidly progressing (www.wheatgenome.org), a quicker and complementary approach to identifying a large number of wheat genes is EST and full-length cDNA sequencing. These resources will prove invaluable for annotating the genomes of wheat and other monocots and as substrates for transgenic improvement of crops. As in Arabidopsis and rice, these tools will prove to be critical in speeding up the genetic improvement of wheat.DNA markers constructed from ESTs are effective since they are contained within an exon region of genes that are actually expressed. Examination of DNA sequence databases permits a direct search for sequence polymorphisms and thus molecular markers. These polymorphisms are typically single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or small insertions–deletions (indels). More importantly, the SNPs are identified in EST sequences, thus the polymorphisms can be used to directly map functional, expressed genes, rather than DNA sequences derived from conventional RAPD and AFLP techniques, which are typically not genes. This has led to studies on linkage disequilibrium in genes to better characterize associations between phenotype and genotype.20–22 To identify an SNP from an EST database, the database must be composed of ESTs derived from different genotypes, followed by alignment of the same EST sequences from different genotypes.23 SNP markers rely upon the underlying redundancy within EST collections and assume that distinct genotype of a plant genome will be represented within a collection.Earlier, we described extensive wheat EST resources including full-length sequences,24–27 and the usage of wheat transcriptome analysis by making a custom microarray with ESTs.28,29 Here, we extend our efforts and describe a collection of further ESTs and the complete functional analysis of the whole EST so far developed (~1 million ESTs). Our work is based on a set of cDNA libraries established from 51 different tissues of interest varied from growth stages and biotic and abiotic stresses in 10 different cultivars.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and cDNA library constructionEighteen libraries from various growth stages, 25 libraries from abiotic stresses (cold, drought, saline, and mineral toxic), and eight libraries from biotic stresses (leaf rust, powdery mildew, and blast) were constructed from eight different wheat lines (Table 1). Out of 51 libraries, 20 libraries were newly constructed and included for this study. Double-stranded cDNAs were synthesized as previously described.24 cDNAs were ligated with pBlueScript SK(+) digested with EcoRI and XhoI. After transformation by electroporation, transformed bacterial cells were initially cultured in the SOC medium for 1 h before culture at 37°C for 2 h in 2× LB medium. Cultured cells were stored in 20% glycerol at -80°C until use. Transformed bacteria were randomly selected and plasmid DNA was extracted.24 Inserted cDNAs were sequenced from both ends using dye terminator cycle sequencing (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).

EST processing and assemblyThe chromatogram files were base called and quality trimmed using PHRED30 with default parameters. Vector, library linker-primer, and EcoRI adapter sequences were removed using CROSSMATCH. Repeat, ambiguous sequences (PHRED quality values <30) and poly (A) tails or poly (T) sequences (at most 10 bases) in the ESTs were trimmed. Subsequently, ESTs with sequences <30 bp were omitted from the final data set. The remaining high-quality sequence was used for further study. All sequence data are available from the DNA database of Japan (Table 1). The processed EST sequence files were combined and assembled into contigs using the CAP3 program31 with a high and low stringency level (high 95% homology in a 20 bp overlap; low 80% homology in a 15 bp overlap). Default CAP3 settings include -p 90 -h 20; the custom parameter settings used were -p 85 -h 90. The CAP3 -p option specifies overlap per cent identity cut-off, while the -h option specifies the maximum alignment overhang percentage.Using the BLAST program (BLASTX with a search threshold of 1e-5), the sequences of the contigs were searched against seven databases (NCBI's nr; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank, Uniprot; http://www.uniprot.org, RAP-DB; http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp, RGAP; http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu, Tair9; http://www.arabidopsis.org, MaizeGDB; http://www.maizegdb.org, and Brachypodium database; http://db.brachypodium.org). According to Ewing et al.,7 only contigs were taken for further analyses. The gene ontology (GO) terms32 of each contig was derived by InterProScan.33 The GO terms were then converted into GO slim term using EBI website (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/QuickGO/) by written perl-script for this purpose. Open reading frames (ORFs) were searched by translating sequences into amino acids by six frames (three per frame in the plus and minus strands).2.3. Transcription factorThe PlnTFDB34 containing 29 473 sequences of plant genes involved in transcriptional control was used to mine our data by local BLAST. The default parameters mentioned in the database was used for prediction (Filter ‘on’, gapped alignment ‘on’, substitution matrix ‘blosum 62’, E-value =1e-10). We included two meta-rules in our classification scheme: (i) if a protein harbours domains characteristic of a transcription factor (TF) family and a transcriptional regulators (TR) family, we assigned it to the TF family, (ii) when the protein of interest contains domains characteristic of more than one TF family or more than one TR family, it was assigned to the family to which its characteristic domains matched with the lowest E-value.2.4. Full-length cDNAThe contigs were classified as full length if it aligned with our full-length cDNA data.27 BLASTN searches of the contigs against the full-length sequences yielded a candidate hit list (E-value =1e-100) of putative full-length sequences that either covered the start and stop codon of the subject sequence or possessed sufficient sequence up/down-stream of the match to contain putative start and stop signals. In a few instances, some contigs covered all but the start methionine, and were also included as full-length sequences. In addition, contigs were aligned (E-value <1e-5, =98% query coverage, =98% identity) with barley full-length sequences35 to know the similarity as well as the full-length nature.2.5. miRNA analysisTo identify conserved miRNA in wheat, contigs were annotated with the plant small RNA regulator target analysis database (http://plantgrn.noble.org/psRNATarget/) containing small RNA of 15 plant species including wheat.36 This database contained 2192 published miRNA sequences, including 32 from Triticum aestivum, 148 from sorghum, 496 from Oryza sativa, 319 from maize, and 224 from A. thaliana. Potential targets were predicted according to the rules applied by37,38: (i) the number of allowed mis-matches at complementary sites between miRNA sequences and potential mRNA targets is four or fewer; and (ii) no gaps are allowed at the complementary sites.2.6. SNP discoverySequence variants or SNPs were mined in wheat contigs with two criteria, and perl-scripts were written for each category. In the first criterion, only contigs with =4 ESTs were selected, and SNPs were declared only when there was no mismatch, no gaps, or N's were admitted before and after an SNP site; in addition, the alternative base to the consensus sequence was present at least more than twice in an alignment. In the second criterion, the SNPs were mined only in the significant sequence of contigs that was worked out by counting the nucleotides of either end of the contigs containing a minimum of four EST members. To find the SNP between cultivars, in addition to the above parameters, the contigs containing the minimum of two consistent EST from the same cultivar were selected. For homoeologous SNPs, the contigs containing the minimum of four EST from the same cultivar were chosen. The visual inspection of SNP was carried out using Tablet software.392.7. Digital gene expression and correspondence analysisFor statistical analysis of gene expression profiles, contigs harbouring five or more constituents were selected from 37 138 contigs. Similarities between contigs or libraries were estimated using Pearson's correlation coefficient.40 Hierarchical clustering was applied to compare EST expression profiles among the 51 wheat tissue/treatments and libraries. Expression profiles are displayed based on the number of constituents in a contig (from 0 to 4647; red intensity), along with an increasing number of constituents. Contigs specific to DREB (dehydration-responsive element binding), NAC (nitrogen assimilation control), OMT (O-methyl transferase), and miRNA 172 were selected to show the differential gene expression in cultivars and growth stage.Correspondence analysis (CA) was carried out by selecting four disease-related libraries (whthls, whthkles, whchan, and whchul; Table 1) as per the procedure detailed in Hamada et al.41 and visualized by a custom-build viewer (available based on request).3. Results3.1. cDNA library construction and assemblyOur previous studies carried out the construction and analysis of 31 libraries.26 Here, we have reported the further addition of 20 libraries and their combined analyses for comprehensive view of wheat EST. At the maximum, we have accumulated ~1 million ESTs (Table 1). The libraries were generated from developmental stages and stresses. After trimming low-quality bases, vector sequences, and shortness (<30 bp), 0.68 million ESTs were used for CAP3 assembly under stringent conditions resulting in 37 138 contigs and 215 199 singlets. When assembled using relaxed settings in CAP3, 65 426 contigs and 66 875 singlets were obtained. The high stringent condition was chosen to achieve a more complete isolation of individual paralogues, orthologues, and homoeologues compared with using a low stringent condition.The total sequence of transcript assemblies in stringent parameter settings, containing both the singlets and contigs, developed in this study was 125.3 Mb with the GC% of 51.9%. This is the maximum transcriptome sequences developed in any plant species. The GC% value is similar to rice but less than that reported in the wheat 3B chromosome exon coding sequence.42 The length of the singlets varied from 31 to 884 bp with an average of 430 bp. The maximum singlets were grouped under 500–600 bp lengths (Fig. 1). As we found a large number of singlets, we subsequently discriminated the singlet contribution among the 10 cultivars (Fig. 1B). There was no correlation observed between the number of ESTs and the singlets. However, the stress-related libraries from four cultivars contributed to 55% of the total singlets. The contig length ranged from 46 to 3960 bp with an average of 879 bp, and ~70% of the contigs extended from 501 to 1000 bp (Fig. 2A). The number of ESTs grouped in each contig varied between 2 and 4647, with 78% of the contigs containing 2–10 EST members (Fig. 2B).

The function of each contig was derived after annotation with rice, Arabidopsis, maize, and Brachypodium databases, in addition to the protein sequences in the GenBank nr database (BLASTX; E-value <1e-5). The recently sequenced Brachypodium was included for its close originated relation with wheat. On annotation, maximum similarity was observed in Brachypodium followed by rice (Table 2). In rice, further annotation was carried out to find the chromosome-wise sequence similarity and identified that chromosome 1 is having much co-linearity followed by chromosome 3 (Fig. 3). On overall annotation, ~3500 genes were found to have no similarity, suggesting new genes in our data. To further validate these new genes, updated tentative consensus sequences from the DFCI wheat gene index (http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/tgi/gimain.pl?gudb=wheat) were annotated and resulted in the same number of new genes (~3500), confirming the importance of our new EST assembly and analysis in wheat. To estimate the total number of full-length cDNAs in our collection, we searched our contig data against our 11 902 full-length cDNA data. With the stringent criteria of >95% similarity and the expected cut-off value of <1e-100, we found ~7000 contigs that were full length in nature, further validated by identification of high similarity of wheat contigs with barley full-length sequences, indicating the robustness of our data and their applications to wheat functional genomics.

Based on the result, the contig was grouped in rice chromosome wise.We also analysed length and ORF distribution in the contigs for both plus and minus strands. To obtain meaningful results, only contigs with >5 ESTs were selected and ORFs were identified. GO annotation of the wheat contigs was performed on the basis of ORF mining of the data. The GO terms were organized into three categories representing molecular functions, biological processes, and cellular components.32 The sum of the wheat contigs per category did not add up to 100% as some contigs were classified into more than one category. Of the total contig set, 21 125 (56%) were annotated into the molecular function category (describing the biochemical activity performed by the gene product), 13 354 (36%) into the biological process GO category (describing the ordered assembly of more than one molecular function), and 13 356 (36%) into the cellular component GO category (describing subcellular compartments of a cell) (Fig. 4). Among the molecular function, the most highly represented categories were binding, catalytic activity, redox activity, and structural activity (Fig. 4A). Among the biological processes, the largest proportion of functionally assigned contigs fell into metabolic, transport, and translation processes, while redox activity, biosynthetic process, regulation, phosphorylation, and transcription comprised 34% of the contigs (Fig. 4B). For the cell component category, almost all contig sequences were annotated into the cell–cell subcategory, 28% into the membrane category, and 23% into the intracellular category (Fig. 4C). Together, all three GO categories accounted for ~82% of the assigned wheat contig set. Functional classification of contig sequences based on GO categorization. Sequences were evaluated for their predicted involvement in molecular function, biological process, and cellular component.Functional classification of contig sequences based on GO categorization. Sequences were evaluated for their predicted involvement in molecular function, biological process, and cellular component.The role and importance of TF lead to mining of our data and resulted in 1183 contigs containing either single or multiple transcription factors. Among the TFs, the CCAAT family was found in as many as 69 contigs. miRNA target sequence analysis of the wheat transcriptome identified different miRNA target sequences in 5180 contigs which ranged from 19 to 24 nt long. The majority of the small RNAs are 20–24 nt long, which is a typical range for dicer-derived products; the 21-nt class is predominant. Among species-specific miRNA, rice had maximum homology followed by maize and Medicago truncatula (Fig. 5). The number of hits for each species is roughly proportional to the number of sequences for that species in the database. Due to the limited number of wheat miRNA sequences in the database, there was only 200 contigs with wheat-specific miRNA target sequences. Among miRNAs, miRNA 395, 172, and 164 target sequences alone were found in 831 contigs, showing the relative abundance of these miRNA target sequences in wheat. miRNA target sequence analysis in wheat contigs.

Sequence polymorphism/SNP miningThe SNPs were mined in our large-scale wheat transcriptome data by applying both relax and stringent criteria. For both criteria, to find reliable SNPs, the common conditions of SNP should be present at a given position when there is no mismatch present 2 bp before or after the SNP site. A total of 51 067 SNPs were detected from 20 609 contigs using the first criterion, resulting in the identification of an SNP site every 96 bp. This value is considerably higher than those reported for earlier studies of wheat.23,43 Hence, the second criterion was applied with an interest to differentiate the homoeologous SNPs from intergenome SNP by calculating the significant sequence length of each contig before mining the SNPs. This approach avoided finding SNPs on either end of the contigs and resulted in the identification of only 6352 SNPs in the wheat contigs. Further classification of the SNPs present between cultivars found 3515 SNPs with a frequency of one SNP per 614 bp. As there were genome constituents of wheat (three homologous genomes) and selective gene expression among the three genomes, we examined the SNP within each cultivar and found 2837 SNPs with an SNP site every 470 bp. The overall SNP frequency based on the stringent criteria was one SNP per 483 bp. Transitions (70%) were more frequent than transversions (30%). As expected, a significant positive correlation (P < 0.05) was observed between the number of SNPs detected in a contig and the number of reads present in that contig. The cultivars, except Chinese spring and Norin4, contain more inter-cultivar sequence variation than homoeologous SNPs. Among cultivars, Halberd, Valuevskaya, and Cranbrook contain almost the same number of SNPs in both cases. Cultivars Atlas, Kitakei1354, Scout, and Thatcher had much less homoeologous sequence variation than cultivar differences (Supplementary Fig. S1).3.4. Digital gene expressionEST frequencies approximate the message abundance in the mRNA population used to construct a cDNA library. We have already attempted to make tissue expression maps of a large number of ESTs from stress-related libraries for in silico screening of stress responsive genes in wheat.26 Here, we aimed to determine the global gene expression of wheat from 51 cDNA libraries, including growth stages and biotic and abiotic stresses. Contigs containing >5 ESTs were subjected to a correlated clustering analysis7 to compare expression profiles in the different libraries. When the result was displayed in the form of a dendrogram (Fig. 6), many libraries with similar origins agglomerated together. All four libraries derived from root tissues treated with boric acid and aluminium united. In the same manner, biotic stress (leaf rust, powdery mildew, and blast)-related tissues were grouped in the same clade. The tissues collected from cv. Valucvskaya, which mainly undergo abiotic stress, were clustered separately. Correlated clustering of wheat cDNA libraries based on gene expression (AT, Atlas; SC, Scout; CC, Chancellor; TC, Thatcher; CR, Cranbrook; HB, Halberd; CS, Chinese Spring; KT, Kitakei1354; NR, Norin4; VV, Valuevskaya).Correlated clustering of wheat cDNA libraries based on gene expression (AT, Atlas; SC, Scout; CC, Chancellor; TC, Thatcher; CR, Cranbrook; HB, Halberd; CS, Chinese Spring; KT, Kitakei1354; NR, Norin4; VV, Valuevskaya).To further determine the tissue-specific gene expression of select genes, digital gene expression was carried out for DREB and NAC TFs, OMT gene, and miRNA 172 targeting site genes in wheat transcripts (Supplementary Fig. S2). The DREB genes are expressed mainly in dehydration-related tissue libraries and the spatial expression was mostly at root tissues. In the case of NAC TF genes, as expected, the expression was only noted in salt-treated libraries and the expression level was greater in root tissue followed by shoot, spikelet, and seed. Interestingly, some biotic stress-related libraries also expressed NAC TF. Based on the preliminary result obtained from our previous study on OMT against self-defence in wheat,29 the OMT-related contigs were mined and its gene expression was analysed. We found ubiquitous expression of OMT genes irrespective of stress, suggesting its defence role against stress. While mining of miRNA in wheat transcriptome, we found an abundance of miRNA 172 target sites. The digital gene expression analysis showed its abundance in all tissues and under all treatments in wheat.In addition to digital expression, a new method of gene discovery and/or gene expression based on CA was carried out to determine specific and common gene expression between libraries or treatments. To identify the common molecular plant–athogen interactions, four libraries constructed for leaf rust and powdery mildew diseases were selected and examined by CA. Contigs with more than or equal to four ESTs were selected, to identify specific genes for leaf rust and powdery mildew diseases, in addition to common disease resistance- and susceptibility-related genes (Supplementary Table S1). The number of genes expressed for powdery mildew outplayed the leaf rust disease. However, the number of disease susceptibility-related genes was more in leaf rust, suggesting different disease reaction mechanisms among diseases in wheat. Overall around 100 new genes were identified from these four disease-related libraries, which could have immense value for future research of molecular plant–pathogen interactions.4. DiscussionGlobal wheat transcriptome analysis was carried out by accumulating ~1 million ESTs from 51 cDNA libraries. In comparison with other studies of wheat which were biased towards one stress or growth stage of a few cultivars,3,26 here we used all growth stages, and biotic and abiotic stresses for 10 different cultivars. The work flow of EST assembly and further analyses were summarized in Fig. 7. Many perl-script programs were written specifically for processing the ESTs, resulting in a 24% reduction in total ESTs. The stringent parameter in EST assembly resulted in more singlets compared with contigs which helped for further analysis, i.e. SNP mining.23 The average length of the contigs (879 bp) is higher than other studies,3,23,44 and ~80% of the contigs containing 2–10 EST members had homoeologous or paralogous genes. To determine the EST member contribution to the contig, we further classified the data into stress- and growth stage-related parameters (Supplementary Fig. S3). Among the 20 stress-related libraries, biotic stress-related libraries contributed more ESTs to the contigs than libraries for abiotic stress (Supplementary Fig. S3A). Among the growth stages, libraries of the spikelet at late flowering contributed more than those of other stages, suggesting differential gene expression among the cultivars with or without any stress (Supplementary Fig. S3B). The high number of unigenes and GC% also suggests the possibility of more genes present in wheat than in other crops.45 This is supported by the recent study of the megabase level sequencing in 3B, which estimated 50 000 genes per diploid genome as a result of the additional non-collinear genes interspersed within the highly conserved ancestral grass gene backbone, suggesting accelerated evolution in the Triticeae lineages.44 The presence of additional genes was further confirmed by identification of new genes based on functional annotation (Fig. 3). When putative wheat gene sequences were analysed for ORF length based on their hit status, we observed significantly shorter ORFs in sequences with no hits. These results suggest that ORF length, not sequence length, is a better indicator of finding transcripts with protein coding capacity and subsequently getting a hit in a sequence database. On the other hand, more than one-third of the sequences without a hit still contained an ORF >300 bp, suggesting that sequences without a hit but with a relatively long ORF may represent new genes with protein coding capacity. We confirmed this by finding more full-length cDNA sequences. Our results also showed a higher no hit percentage in singlet sequences, most likely due to the fact that singletons represent rare genes in the wheat genome that are not well described in other organisms.

The software used in the respective step was mentioned in parallel.4.1. Functional characterizationGO analysis revealed expected categories such as molecular, biological, and cellular processes (Fig. 5). In wheat, the major molecular processes were binding and catalytic activities, similarly found in other Poaceae species.44,46,47 Metabolic, transport, and translation functions accounted for 50% of the biological processes. Among cellular processes, as expected, membrane, intracellular, and ribosome functions played a major role. Using data from the plant TF database,34 we found 1183 contigs from wheat that had a high similarity with 2197 different coding sequences of TF from seven species; the high similarity percentage was found with rice. The number of TF found in wheat contigs was higher than reported in Salvia sclorea calyx which was sequenced using 454 pyrosequncing.48 The most represented TF family in wheat was CCAAT. The CCAAT box is a common cis-acting element found in the promoter and enhancer regions of a large number of genes in higher eukaryotes (for review).49,50 In addition to this TF family, several other TF families known to be involved in plant development were also present in our data.The role of miRNAs in developmental and stress regulation is not well established in wheat, and increasingly tissue-specific and developmental regulation of miRNAs is being found mostly in animal species.51 Through cDNA sequencing efforts, we have identified transcripts that encode 945 different miRNAs,52 although additional wheat-specific miRNAs may still remain in the cDNA collection. Indeed, a large number of ncRNAs have the potential to form miRNA-like stem loop precursors (data not shown), but experimental validation of these potential miRNA is required. In our study, we found an abundance of miRNA 172 target sites in as many as 236 contigs, and their uniform expression irrespective of growth stage and/or stress was confirmed by in silico gene expression analysis (Supplementary Fig. S2D).The digital gene expression pattern of genes related to biotic and abiotic stresses (OMT, DREB, and NAC TFs), and epigenetic gene silencing has helped us to determine their quantitative and qualitative gene expression patterns.7 This approach permits both the association of tissues via their common patterns of gene expression and the association of genes via their tissue-dependent expression patterns. The correlation clustering of 51 libraries formed the groups of the libraries based on respective treatments or stages which confirmed the importance of libraries as well gene expression specific to treatment.26CA is an explorative computational method for the study of associations between variables. Much like principle component analysis, it displays a low dimensional projection of the data, e.g. into the plane with three-dimensional view (Supplementary Fig. S4), which can be achieved for two to three variables simultaneously, thus revealing associations between them. Traditionally, CA has been used prevalently in categorical data in the social sciences, but its application has been extended also to physical quantities and to proteomics.53 This method allows us to quickly analyse the set of EST libraries and to discover molecular pathogenicity on wheat. In four disease-related libraries, ribulose 1–5 biphosphate and S-adenosyl methionine genes were commonly found. In leaf rust, UDP-glucosyl transferase and chlorophyll a–b binding protein were highly expressed,29 while in powdery mildew treatment, ADP-ribosylation factor, lipid transfer protein, and oxalate oxidase were specifically expressed. The advantage of CA analysis helped to find the common molecular resistance mechanism in wheat.54 While comparing susceptible and resistance reaction mechanisms, some of the genes, such as 40S, 60S ribosomal protein and Zinc finger domain-containing protein genes, have copy number variations between the two mechanisms. We have shown that the application of CA to EST data provides an informative and concise means of visualizing these data, being capable of uncovering relationships both among either gene and between genes, in particular or common stages.4.2. SNP miningAssembly of EST sequences into contigs in a polyploidy species like hexaploid wheat results in each contig being composed of ESTs from homoeologous loci and members of gene families.23 SNPs are the most abundantly found co-dominant polymorphic sites in greater proportion both in intronic and in exonic regions of the genome. They occur with variable frequencies and have become very popular in plant genetics and breeding due to their amenability for high throughput genotyping. In continuation of our earlier study to discriminate homoeologous gene expression of hexaploid wheat by SNP analysis of contigs grouped from 10 cDNA libraries from Chinese Spring,43 we have mined our large-scale data to find SNPs from 10 different cultivars with various stress treatments. With relaxed criteria, we estimated ~50 000 SNPs in wheat with an SNP frequency of one SNP per 96 bp—a number that is higher than our previous report.43 This high number might be due to the EST originating from 10 different cultivars with various stress conditions, although the possibilities of over-estimation from the end sequences could not be excluded. Hence, a new criterion was applied by calculating the significant sequence length to avoid the end sequence and sequencing error-based SNPs. This approach accounted for only 20% of the SNPs obtained by the initial approach, and could lead to an underestimation of nucleotide diversity, although it guarantees the elimination of false positives. The stringent parameter resulted in the SNP frequency of one SNP in every 483 bp. In comparison of SNPs among huge genome size species, coffee has one SNP every 222 bp;55 sugarcane has one SNP every 290 bp;16 cotton has one SNP every 500 bp;17 oak has a frequency similar to cotton with one SNP every 471 bp.18 Our result in wheat compared with other species could explain the low polymorphism found in polyploidy species. The comparison of SNPs found between and within cultivars showed higher SNP frequency between cultivars (Supplementary Fig. S1), confirming that the low level of polymorphism identified between homoeologous genomes compared with inter-genome differences could be useful to select parents for linkage mapping studies.5. ConclusionThe global wheat EST assembly presented here provides an unprecedented look at the wheat transcriptome and contributes tools for wheat genetics and genomics effort. The development and inclusion of cDNA libraries from all growth stages, various tissues, and treatments portray the complete picture of wheat transcriptome. Functional annotation and characterization give new ideas about wheat expressed genome, at least in part. The identified SNPs are invaluable resources for functional genomics and molecular breeding application. This set of processed EST sequences provides a seed for future investigation of wheat functional genomics using both long and short oligonucleotide arrays. Our data will thus act as a backbone for wheat genome sequence assembly, which is progressing rapidly.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research on priority areas ‘Comparative Genomics’ and the National Bio-resource Project from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.

IntroductionGene family members are paralogous copies created by duplications, which vary in size and genomic organization. Duplication events give rise to multiple gene copies, probably providing raw materials for functional gene innovation. In plants, genome complexity is fundamentally determined by rounds of polyploidy and individual duplications accompanied by gene expansion, thereby implying that the study of evolutionary history is crucial to understanding the functional divergence of gene family members and the manner in which new functions arise.1 There is little doubt that gene duplications have the potential to produce new gene functions in the long-term.2,3 Much less understood are the early stages in the emergence and evolution of gene duplications, and in particular, the fixation of a polymorphic duplicate.1,3 When compared with functional innovation (neofunctionalization), it has been determined that many gene duplicates remain in genomes as the result of passive mechanisms such as subfunctionalization.2 Theoretical studies and data gathered through in silico analyses have advanced our understanding of the functional diversity of gene families and possible retention mechanisms, but large amounts of comparative functional data are required, and data acquisition is usually a very technically challenging proposition.Non-specific lipid transfer proteins (nsLTPs) are known to be a small multi-gene family in plants and are denominated in accordance with their ability to reversibly bind and transport to hydrophobic molecules in vitro.4 These cationic peptides were originally subdivided on the basis of molecular mass into type 1 (9 kDa) and type 2 (7 kDa), both of which belong to the eight-cysteine motif (8 CM) protein family (Pfam PF00234), with a conserved 8 CM backbone, as follows: C-Xn-C-Xn-CC-Xn-CXC-Xn-C-Xn-C.5–7 The cysteine residues are arranged in four disulphide bonds to stabilize a tertiary structure of the hydrophobic cavity, the size plasticity of which allows for the in vitro loading of a broad variety of lipid compounds.4,8 For type 1 LTPs, computational and biochemical analyses have shown that nsLTPs from various plants are capable of accommodating lipids such as phospholipids,4 palmitic acid (C16:0), and the acyl chains of 1,2-dimyristoylphosphatidylglycerol.8 However, less is currently known regarding the lipid-binding properties of type 2 nsLTPs.The exact functions of nsLTPs remain unclear. Multiple physiological functions that have been suggested include cutin synthesis,9,10 somatic embryogenesis,11 stigma and pollen adhesion,12,13 and plant defence.6,10,14–16 An accumulating body of evidence supports the role of nsLTPs in cuticle synthesis, including their extracellular localization and lipid-binding capability on fatty acids with hydroxyl and cetoxyl groups.9,17 Furthermore, the nsLTP genes from some plants are expressed in the leaf epidermal cell layer, where the waxy cuticle is generally found.9,18 However, more complex expression profiles from individual experiments are frequently observed, such as expression in the xylem, phloem, or stigma, which can lead to disparate and unpredictable gene functions of nsLTPs.11–13There has been no conserved functional perspective, systematic expression analysis, or clear evolutionary story with regard to members of the nsLTP gene family. Thus, in this study, we conducted a comparative analysis of a cluster of nsLTP genes from rice and sorghum in an effort to address several key questions regarding the evolutionary fate and functional diversity or redundancy of this gene family. A phylogeny analysis was conducted by trying to identify nsLTP genes from nine plant species, covering monocots, dicots, ferns, mosses, and algae. Subsequently, the syntenic gene pairs in rice and sorghum were determined by the genomic organization in conjunction with large-scale duplicated blocks. We combined the analyses with microarray data, transgenic promoter–reporter assay, and semi-quantitative reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) in order to discern the gene functions and evolutionary fate of nsLTP genes. Additionally, the evolutionary mechanisms after duplication for one gene cluster were discussed, considering that rice and sorghum experienced pre-grass whole genome duplication prior to speciation.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sequence identification and phylogenetic analysisFull genome assemblies of nine plant species representing eudicots (Arabidopsis thaliana), magnoliid dicots (Aquilegia coerulea), monocots (Sorghum bicolor, Oryza sativa, and Brachypodium distachyon), ferns (Selaginella moellendorffii), mosses (Physcomitrella patens), and algae (Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and Volvox carteri) were downloaded from the Joint Genome Institute plant genomics database (http://www.Phytozome.net). Protein sequences annotated with the HMMPfam domain PF00234 (plant lipid transfer/seed storage/trypsin–alpha amylase inhibitor) were retrieved as a query and further blast-searched against nine full genome databases to avoid the loss of plant nsLTP genes due to mis- and unannotation, with a cut-off value of e-10. The deduced amino acid sequences of candidate nsLTP genes were manually confirmed to harbour the 8 CM (C … C … CC … CXC … C … C, where X represents any amino acid) and genes lacking the motif and encoding for the putative proline-rich proteins were excluded from further analyses. The protein sequences of the putative 2S-albumins, AtALB119 and alpha amylase inhibitor, RAT120 were then BLAST-searched against the obtained candidate nsLTP proteins to exclude possible cereal storage proteins and inhibitors in the retrieved nsLTP datasets. Additionally, the proteins harbouring the glycosylphosphatidylinositol-anchored motif were not employed. The deduced amino acid sequences of all the nsLTP genes were aligned using the ClustalW program with default parameters. The phylogenetic tree was conducted with MEGA software version 521 using a maximum-like algorithm with 1000 bootstrap replicates.2.2. Mapping chromosome location and duplicated blocksSyntenic gene sets against chromosomes of rice and sorghum, and of chromosomes shared between rice and sorghum, were downloaded from the PGDB database (http://chibba.agtec.uga.edu/duplication/). The pan-grass and pre-grass syntenic gene sets were downloaded from the CoGe database (http://synteny.cnr.berkeley.edu/CoGe/). The collinear nsLTP genes that matched in the syntenic gene sets were selected for further study. The genomic localization and collinearity of nsLTP genes in/between the genomes of rice and sorghum were visualized using Circos software.222.3. Expression analysis and co-expression analysis based on microarray datasetThe expression of nsLTP genes during developmental stages presented as heat maps was generated by the Gen-evestigator (http://www.genevestigator.ethz.ch) webtool with default parameters. A total of 39 rice and 233 Arabidopsis GEO (Gene Expression Ominbus) datasets of high quality were employed. Genes for which probes were not found included Os11g02389, Os11g02369, Os12g02340, and Os06g06340 of group I and Os04g33930 of group IV; these were excluded for further study, as was Os11g02350, due to low specificity.To conduct co-expression analysis, the CEL files of Affymetrix GeneChip genome arrays of O. sativa were manually downloaded from the GEO datasets of the NCBI database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/), gathering a total of 914 GSM samples. The microarray CEL files were normalized via the RMA method using R software (http://www.r-project.org/). The similarity between the expression profiles of genes across the microarray dataset was evaluated via Pearson's correlation coefficient. In order to determine the cut-off of the co-expressed gene, we surveyed the distribution of similarity of 124 750 random pairs, resulting in an r = 0.792 (a = 0.01).23 The functional enrichment analysis of co-expressed genes was conducted via agriGO tools (http://bioinfo.cau.edu.cn/agriGO/) with default parameters.2.4. nsLTP promoter::uidA fusion construction and transgenic plant generationA total of 23 nsLTP promoters, including 15 of rice and 8 of sorghum, were utilized for a ß-glucuronidase (GUS) reporter assay in Arabidopsis. Approximately 1 kb upstream of nsLTP genes was amplified from the genomic DNAs of O. sativa (cv. Niponbire; OsLTP) and S. bicolor (cv. BTX623; ScLTP) and cloned into a binary vector of pBI121 without a native CaMV35S promoter. The construction of promoter::uidA fusions and their transformation into plants were conducted as previously described.242.5. Histochemical GUS analysesT2 plants of 3–10 independent transgenic lines harbouring each construct were selected for GUS expression analysis following the plant whole life cycle. Histochemical analyses were conducted with T2 plants according to the procedures previously described.9 The T3 lines harbouring pBI121 vectors with or without the 35s promoter were used as positive and negative controls, respectively.2.6. Abiotic stress treatments and semi-quantitative RT–PCRSeeds of rice and sorghum were allowed to germinate on moisture filter papers and then grown in containers as previously described.24 After 36 h, the water was replaced with 0.44% Murashige and Skoog medium (Duchefa Biochemie B.V., Haarlem, Netherlands) and the plants were grown for 10 days with a photoperiod of 14/10 h at a temperature of 28°C/25°C (day/night) before abiotic stress treatments. Treatments with types of abiotic stresses such as drought, salinity, cold, and wounding were conducted as previously described.24 RNA isolation and semi-quantitative RT–PCR were carried out as described.24 The actin genes for rice and sorghum were employed as an internal control with specific primers (Supplementary Table S1).3. Results3.1. NsLTP gene family in plantsThe protein sequences of the family annotation (Pfam 00234: Plant lipid transfer/seed storage/trypsin–alpha amylase inhibitor) were first retrieved from the full genome datasets of the nine plant species. Because the plant LTPs were clustered together with several other proteins, the obtained sequences were examined manually for the existence of the 8 CM and seed storage proteins, and trypsin–alpha amylase inhibitors were excluded as described elsewhere.7,25 The protein sequences of alpha amylase/trypsin inhibitors are usually large molecules with 10 cysteine residues.26 Hybrid proline-rich proteins harbour an additional N-terminal domain at the C-terminal 8 CM.25 Primarily, the sequences of 195 plant full-length nsLTP genes were employed in the construction of a phylogenic tree to evaluate their phylogenic relationship. We determined that the putative 7 kDa nsLTPs from rice and Arabidopsis clustered into one group, with a bootstrap value of 95 (Supplementary Fig. S1), distinct from the other group that harbours the putative 9 kDa nsLTPs. A similar result was also noted in a previous study.7 Although both 7 and 9 kDa nsLTPs harbour the conserved 8 CM pattern, structural and lipid-binding studies have demonstrated that they contain different tertiary structures and lipid-binding spectra. Herein, we excluded the group harbouring 7 kDa nsLTP genes in order to clarify the evolutional mechanism 9 kDa nsLTP genes. Finally, a total of 115 full-length 9 kDa nsLTP-related genes retrieved from seven plant species, including 31 of O. sativa, 16 of S. bicolor, 14 of B. distachyon, 24 of A. thaliana, 10 of A. coerulea, 14 of P. patens, and 5 of S. moelendorffii were employed for further analysis.The phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum-likelihood method and the solidity of the nodes was assessed by 1000 bootstrap resampling repetitions. Initially, the organization of the tree supports eight independent groups, whereas the nsLTPs from P. patens and S. moelendorffii formed several branches without significant bootstrap values and thus were employed as out-groups. Based on the position in the tree and the criterion of more than 30% sequence identity in one group, we classified the nsLTP genes from angiosperms into five groups with bootstrap values ranging from 61 to 100 (Fig. 1). Boutrot et al.7 previously defined the nsLTPs from Arabidopsis, rice, and wheat into nine types. On the basis of the comparison between the previous dataset and ours, the five groups classified here were in agreement with the nsLTPs of type I, III, V, VI, and IX. Although the type I appeared paraphyletic with a bootstrap value of only 61, the included nsLTPs shared the conserved cysteine motif in the same position, containing nine residues between Cys1 and Cys2, and 19 residues between the conserved Cys4 and Cys5. In fact, the nsLTPs used to classify each group evidenced variations in the number of flanking amino acids between cysteine residues, reflecting possible changes in catalytic activity (Supplementary Fig. S2). The genes of type I were subsequently divided into five clades, in which clade I.1 contained the largest numbers of gene copies among the clades or groups, only in grass lineage. Five nsLTP genes of P. patens and S .moellendorffii were located at the same branch as that of the type V genes, and were classified together as type D by Edstam et al.27; however, no significant bootstrap value was observed in our tree, and they contain a different cysteine pattern from the type V.

Genomic organization of nsLTP genes in rice and sorghumThe physical locations of 32 OsLTPs and 17 SbLTPs including a partial gene (Sb05g001086) were assigned to 10 of 12 rice chromosomes and 7 of 10 sorghum chromosomes, respectively (Fig. 2). In clade I.1, six tandem genes on the distal region of rice chromosome 11 were found to be collinear with those in the counterpart of rice chromosome 12 without any loss. By way of contrast, five nsLTP tandem genes were detected on chromosome 8 of sorghum, while only one gene (Sb05g001086) was found in the paralogous chromosome 5 (Fig. 2). The gene (Sb05g001086) contained a partial nsLTP sequence encoding a truncated protein, and thus was not included in our phylogenetic analysis. One of the tandem duplicate pairs (Os11g02424 and Os12g02340) on rice chromosome 11 and 12, respectively, was also collinear with Os01g64070 and Os05g40010 in clade I.2. In group II, Os09g35700 was orthologous with Sb02g030420, which was collinear with Sb07g025160. The orthologous gene pairs between rice and sorghum were also observed in group IV (Sb03g033980 vs Os01g62980, Sb06g016170 vs Os04g33920) and group V (Sb01g026220 vs Os10g05720).

Chromosomal localization of nsLTP genes was indicated in each species. The orthologous pairs between rice and sorghum were connected in green. The collinear paralogs detected in synteny blocks were connected in red. Detailed information for gene pairs is indicated after the gene locus name.To clarify the relationships among the duplicated gene pairs in clade I.1, detailed genomic visualization of this gene cluster was conducted via a comparison between rice and sorghum. Highly conserved gene order at the locus containing the nsLTP genes was identified between rice chromosomes 11 and 12 and sorghum chromosome 8 (Fig. 3A). The synteny block on sorghum chromosome 8 contained 5 nsLTPs and two nearly collinear genes located towards the centromere (Fig. 3A), while this genome fragment was inverted, perhaps as the result of DNA inversion and rearrangement in the sorghum genome after whole genome duplication. Although only three out of five copies were defined as orthologous with those OsLTP genes in the database (Fig. 2), a more detailed genome comparison by setting the parameter ‘high sequence similarity > 200 bp’ revealed single lines between all five SbLTPs and five pairs of the collinear OsLTP genes, reinforcing the hypothesis of a well-conserved orthologous relationship (Fig. 3A). The collinear gene orders were also found to exist between orthologous chromosome 5 in sorghum and 11 in rice in the region including the nsLTP gene-rich locus, whereas only one partial nsLTP (Sb05g001086) remained in the sorghum genome. The further analysis by the VISTA plot revealed that each of the collinear gene pairs displayed a near-identical homology including both coding regions and at least partial upstream or downstream sequences (Fig. 3C). In particular, Os12g02300 and Os11g02350 evidenced striking sequence identity throughout the whole genomic region covering 1000 bp upstream of the start codon and 300 bp downstream of the stop codon.

Microarray-based expression profile of OsLTPsThe rice nsLTP genes included in type I were responsible for the most ubiquitous and broadest expression covering the seedling, shoot, inflorescence, and seed, but were rare in the root (Supplementary Fig. S3). The organ-specific expression dynamics revealed the redundant but distinct expression pattern of these genes throughout the entire life cycle in rice. For example, the expressions of Os12g02300, Os11g02330, Os12g02290, Os01g60740, and Os08g03690 were particularly strong in the embryo, whereas Os11g02424 and Os03g59380 expressions were high in the anther. A distinct expression pattern was noted in two type IV genes: Os05g06780 and Os01g62980 were expressed in the crown and shoot, but not in the young seedling, inflorescence, or seed. Only trace expression signals of Os04g33920 were detected in the embryo and crown. No type III genes and only a few genes of type VI were expressed over various tissues.To obtain additional clues regarding the functions of nsLTPs, co-expression analysis was conducted by employing microarray data. Several OsLTPs in clade I.1 appear to be frequently co-expressed together, including Os11g02400, Os11g02389, Os11g02424, Os11g02369, and Os12g02310; functional enrichment tests identified these OsLTPs as being involved with transport, establishment of localization, and localization (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). Furthermore, co-expressed gene members related to ATP binding/synthesis, oxidation reduction, and hydrolase were observed abundantly throughout the nsLTP gene family, and were generally associated with primary metabolic and metabolic processes on the functional enrichment test. Os03g59380 in clade I.5 was highly co-expressed with a dozen MADS box transcription factor gene members.3.4. Tissue-specific expressions of nsLTP promoter::udA fusions in type IBased on our rice microarray data, two abundantly expressed types (I and V) were chosen for further analysis, using a promoter::uidA fusion strategy in transgenic Arabidopsis. In clade I.1, the transgenic plants for eight OsLTP gene promoters were successively obtained, including three collinear pairs—i.e. Os11g02350 vs Os12g02300, Os11g02369 vs Os12g02310, and Os11g02389 vs Os12g02320—of the duplicate blocks between rice chromosomes 11 and 12. Five sorghum nsLTP gene promoters in the syntenic region of chromosome 8 were employed for analysis. Most nsLTP promoters in clade I.1, with the exception of Sb08g002700, drove GUS activities related principally with the epidermis of various tissues such as the germinated seedling (Fig. 4A1–12), root tip (Fig. 4I1–2), young leaf including guard cell (Fig. 4B1–12 and C1–12), shoot (Fig. 4D1–12 and E1–12), flower bud including ovary, stigma, and anther (Fig. 4F1–12 and G1–12), young silique including abscission zone (Fig. 4H1–12) and seed, including the embryo, endosperm, and integument layer (Fig. 4I3–12). Following the expression dynamics of this gene cluster, we divided this expression module into 12 unique sub-expression motifs, including the cotyledon, hypocotyl, highly active in young leaf, highly active in old leaf, root tip, wound sites, anther, ovary, stigma, silique abscission zone, young silique, and seed (Supplementary Fig. S4). At the tissue-specific level, these genes displayed an overlapping but complementary expression pattern. The most conserved expression was found in the meristematic region of the rosette (highly active in young leaf), wound shoot, and abscission zone (Fig. 4B1–12, C1–12, and H1–12, Supplementary Fig. S4). By way of contrast, only Os11g02400 and Os12g02340 were found to be active in the root tip (Fig. 4I1–2). In rice, a markedly overlapping expression pattern between rice collinear gene pairs (Os11g02350 vs Os12g02300, and Os11g02369 vs Os12g02310) was observed, which also shared relatively longer proximal promoter regions with a high degree of sequence homology (Fig. 3C and Supplementary Fig. S4). However, Os11g02389 evidenced only trace expression in the meristematic region of the rosette, stigma, and abscission zone, when compared with the collinear gene of Os12g02320, which was widely expressed. This expression pattern in relation to the epidermal cells of young growing tissues was also conserved in three sorghum paralogous genes (Sb08g002670, Sb08g002680, and Sb08g002690). Divergent expression was noted for Sb08g002660, which did not evidence the strongest expression in the young leaves, but did evidence strong expression in old leaves (Fig. 4B2), distinct from the majority of the other homologues. Additionally, the GUS activities of the Sb08g002700 promoter were localized in the vascular bundles of rosettes and young shoots (Fig. 4A13, B13, C13, D13, E13, F13, G13, and H13), which differed markedly from those of the collinear rice genes (Os11g02350 vs Os12g02300).

The promoters of both Os01g12020 and Sb03g001580 in clade I.4 drove expression in the anther (Fig. 5B), revealing an expressional conservation. The expression of Os01g12020 in the anther was previously reported.28Tissue-specific expressions of rice and sorghum nsLTP promoter::uidA fusions in clade I.3, I.4, and type V.

Tissue-specific expressions of nsLTP promoter::udA fusions in type VDistinct expression patterns of members of type V, which included Os01g62980, Os05g06780 and the orthologous gene of Sb03g039880, were expressed principally in the vascular tissues of the rosette (including hypocotyl and root) and young shoot (Fig. 5C1–F4). Strong expression was noted in the meristematic region and was reduced as the tissues aged. GUS activities were also evident in the anther, including pollen, driven by the promoters of Os01g62980 and Os05g06780, which were not demonstrated via microarray analysis.3.6. Transcriptional responses of rice and sorghum nsLTP genes against abiotic stressesA total of 22 OsLTP and 10 SbLTP genes of type I and type V were employed for semi-quantitative RT–PCR analysis and their amplicons were confirmed via sequencing. However, seven genes (Os11g02330, Os11g02389, Os03g59380, Os08g03690, Os01g12020, Os04g033930, and Sb03g001580) were not amplified, even after 45 PCR cycles. The lack of amplification of Os11g02330 and Os04g033930 was inconsistent with the microarray and GUS assay data (Figs 3 and 4). This may be attributable to the cross-hybridization of microarray probes, low expression level in native plants, or unsuitable primer design.Figure 6 shows that most of the genes in clade I.1 evidenced induced expression against wounding stress, with the exception of Os11g024070. When compared with other rice genes in clade I.1, Os01g024070 evidenced a minimal relationship and a lack of wounding-mediated induction, but was induced by salt. The expression of the tandem-repeat genes in rice chromosomes 11 and 12 (clade I.1, except for Os11g024070) appeared to be rarely stimulated in response to drought, salt, and cold. By way of contrast, the five orthologous sorghum nsLTP genes were more broadly and frequently induced, in which Sb08g002670 and Sb08g002690 could be induced by all four of the abiotic stresses. Sb08g002680, a tandem copy, could not be induced by drought, salt, or cold. Among the detected genes in clade I.1, four OsLTPs (36.3%) and four SbLTPs (80.0%) were abundantly expressed, whereas four OsLTPs (36%) and three SbLTPs (60.0%) were stimulated by drought. Additionally, three OsLTPs (27.2%) and three SbLTPs (60%) were stimulated by salt, and four OsLTPs (60%) and three SbLTPs (60%) were stimulated by cold. The collinear OsLTP gene pairs in clade I.1 did not evidence a significantly parallel expression pattern, as most of these genes were not stimulated by the tested stresses. By way of contrast, both Os12g02300 and Os11g02350 were induced by wounding and drought. RT–PCR analysis of the expressions of nsLTP genes against abiotic stresses.

Os05g40010 was induced by all four abiotic stresses, which differed from the rice gene pairs in type I.1. Os01g60740 appeared to lose the salt-induced expression. Sb03g038280 was stimulated only by cold. The orthologous genes of Os05g06780 and Sb03g039880 in type V could both be induced by all the four stresses. Both of Os04g33920 and Sb06g016170 lost the expression induced by cold, and Os04g33920 was not stimulated by wounding.4. Discussion4.1. Phylogeny and nsLTP gene family radiationAmong the nine species examined, the lack of nsLTP genes in the two algal genomes of C. reinhardtii and V. carteri probably suggests an ancient origin of the 9 kDa nsLTP gene in embryophytes after divergence between green algae and land plants, which might be consistent with the emergence of the cuticle during land plant evolution. Edstam et al.27 also found no nsLTP genes in an examination of four green algae of Chorophyta and one red algae of Charophyta, but identified two types of nsLTP genes in Marchantiophyta (liverwort). Some bryophytes, including moss, liverwort, and hornwort, harbour a thin layer of cuticle on their surface as well as on their reproductive organs.29,30 However, the presence of a cuticle in P. patens has never been confirmed.Boutrot et al.7 previously conducted a phylogenetic analysis of nsLTPs from wheat (122), rice (52), and Arabidopsis (49), classifying them into nine types with distinct cysteine patterns. In this study, we have classified the 9 kDa nsLTP genes of angiosperm into five groups, which should be the previously named type I, III, V, VI, and IX, according to the cysteine pattern and the gene members. For instance, Os11g02379.1 and Os11g02379.2, which were previously identified as type I, were replaced by Os11g02369 and Os11g02389 following database update. We also identified additional nsLTPs of Os03g25350 and Os11g03870 in type VI. However, the previously identified type VIII (Os06g49770) and type Y (Os03g44000, Os07g27940, and Os11g34660) were not employed in our analysis, as the peptide length in these genes exceeded 120 amino acids. The five classified types in our study harboured identical Arabidopsis nsLTPs members in the previous analysis conducted by Boutrot et al.,7 whereas additional AtLTP genes such as At1g77470, At1g52415, At2g16592, At2G13295, At3F29152, and At4g12825 were found among these five types. Using the 8 CM method, Liu et al.31 identified 135 Solanaceae nsLTPs, 52.59% of which were classified into type X, a possible subtype of type I with a similar cysteine pattern. In our analysis, the type I nsLTPs were composed of those of monocots, magnoliid dicots, and eudicots. Five sub-clades were grouped into type I, while the positions in the phylogenetic tree and the low bootstrap values indicate that several ancestors might exist in this group prior to diversification into angiosperms. Additionally, the author argued that some monocot- or dicot-specific types of nsLTPs, e.g. type IX, might have evolved before the monocot-dicot split. The results of our comparative phylogenetic analysis also demonstrated the Arabidopsis-specific type IX and several independent branches of nsLTPs from fern (S. moellendorffii) and moss (P. patens). These results imply that the nsLTP genes with different cysteine patterns emerged, subsequently expanded, and became evolutionarily fixed in angiosperms or single species. In the present study, our interest laid principally with the nsLTP genes in Poaceae, such as rice and sorghum. On the basis of the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1), clusters of the nsLTP genes in grass lineage have continuously expanded in type I, V, and VI, indicating rounds of duplications with different gene loss in each species. The preservation of a large number of young gene copies in clade I.1 is interesting with regard to functional innovation and evolutionary mechanisms occurring after duplication.4.2. Concerted evolution of rice nsLTPs in clade I.1Poaceae dates back to 50–70million years, after the shared pre-grass whole genome duplication event on the last common ancestor.32 The distal regions of rice chromosomes 11 (5.44 Mb) and 12 (4.27 Mb) were thought to have resulted from a recent (5–7million years ago) duplication,33 but a comparison with the sorghum genome indicates their existence before sorghum and rice diverged about 50million years ago,32 thus suggesting its ancestral nature. Illegitimate recombinations such as gene conversion may have occurred frequently at this segmental region between the homeologous chromosomes, allowing for rounds of genomic sequence homogenization, and leading to a high level of concerted evolution of this genomic segment on rice chromosomes 11 and 12.32,33As described elsewhere,35 six tandem nsLTP gene pairs on the distal region of rice chromosomes 11 and 12 were presently found to be in collinear order. However, only five gene copies were preserved in the corresponding region of sorghum chromosome 8, and only one truncated gene in chromosome 5. Even though this segmental duplication was supposed to have appeared at least 50million years ago, the highly similar sequences between each collinear gene pair enable them to fall within the same phylogenic branch (Fig. 3B), as the alignment of coding sequences displayed an identity of >98%. The high sequence similarity between the collinear gene pairs on the genomic locus included both the coding and flanking regulatory sequences (Fig. 3C). Because non-coding regions generally evolve rapidly after duplication, the high sequence homology at this locus between rice chromosomes 11 and 12 strongly supports the existence of gene conversion events, as previously described,34 which means that this cluster of nsLTP genes on rice chromosomes 11 and 12 have undergone concerted evolution for more than 50million years. However, the sorghum genome fragment the nsLTP genes appears to be inverted on chromosome 8, and thus may have escaped the chance of recombination with the homoeologous region on chromosome 5.4.3. Expression and possible functions of nsLTPsAccording to our analysis of the public rice microarray data, the most abundant nsLTP expression can be attributed to type I nsLTPs, especially in clade I.1, which might have undergone concerted evolution. The systematic examination of transgenic promoter activities of this type nsLTPs also evidenced a broad expression profile during the entirety of the plant life cycle. In clade I.1, an expression feature related with the epidermis of aerial growing tissues, which was highly conserved in the young leaf/leaf primordia, wound site, and abscission zone, was observed for most rice and sorghum genes, even though the expression dynamics in each organ/tissue were also apparent. This expression feature is supported by previous studies, including nsLTPs, throughout dicot and monocot plants.5,13,18,23,36 By accessing the public microarray data in Arabidopsis, it was determined that similar expression patterns could be represented by the gene cluster in clade I.2, in which at least four genes, including AT2G15050, AT3G51600 (AtLTP5), AT2g38530 (AtLTP2), and At2g38540 (AtLTP1), should have preserved expression motifs in the shoot apical meristem or leaf primordial (Supplementary Fig. S4). This result is consistent with the recent transgenic promoter analysis including AtLTP1-6.13The epidermal expression of young aerial growing tissue has been noted as one of the evidences correlating nsLTP to cutin synthesis, where the cuticular wax is usually localized.18 As anticipated, the parallel distribution of the cuticle and nsLTPs were detected at the abscission zone, guard cell, ovary epidermis, anther, stigma, embryo, and testa.30 Plants evolved the cuticle and stomata at the same time, and the presence of these structures as early as that of the gametophytes of moss and hornworts has been confirmed. Herein, both our phylogenic analysis and the observed expression conservation in type I support the association between nsLTPs and cutin synthesis. Additionally, the epidermis-specific expression could also indicate the involvement of nsLTPs in plant defence to protect young growing tissues against phytopathogen attack, as these peptides evidence intrinsic antimicrobial activities and their involvement in plant defence mechanisms has been demonstrated.6,14 Such a role was particularly consistent with the fact that most of the type I nsLTP genes were wounding-inducible, as revealed by both our transgenic promoter and RT–PCR analysis (Figs 4E1–13 and 6A).The expression patterns in stigma and pollen were also observed in clade I.1, especially for Os11g02389 and Sb08g002680, which conferred rare expression in floral organs but strong in the stigma, which indicated the possible function of pollen–pistil interaction (Fig. 4G5 and 7). An LTP like protein SCA from the lily was previously suggested to play a role in pollen tube adhesion and guidance, which functions to form an adhesive matrix with pectin that guides pollen tubes to the ovules.12,13 On the basis of the lipid-binding cavity, another model was suggested wherein LTP could exert a cell wall-loosening effect on the cells of the secretory zone of the stigma. It could also be proposed that the relative conserved expression in young growing tissues may also imply the function involved in cell expansion, as plant growth is largely attributable to the cell expansion that occurs after cell division from the meristem.37The expression in grain was observed primarily in the embryo, endosperm, and integumentary layer (Fig. 4I3–7), as was also detected in another study of wheat nsLTP promoters.38 As the cuticle does not exist in the endosperm, a simple functional involvement of these LTPs in cutin synthesis seems modest. In endospermic seeds, such as cereals, the endosperm generally accumulates significant quantities of starch and lipid reserves and is hydrolyzed to fuel post-germination growth. Therefore, the properties of spectrum transport in lipids imply that nsLTPs may play endosperm lipid-recycling role during seed maturation and germination. In Euphorbia lagascae, several nsLTPs were abundantly observed and correlated with programmed cell death response during endosperm degradation.39 This hypothesis is consistent with our co-expression data showing that abundant genes related to oxidation reduction and hydrolase were observed. Another possibility is that these peptides may function similarly to seed storage proteins, such as 2S-albumins and protease inhibitors, as these evolutionarily related proteins could also harbour 8 CM motif sharing structures similar to those of LTPs.40 In the present study, clade I.1 is in a grass lineage and harbours the largest nsLTP duplicates. Our examination of public microarrays indicated that these young duplicates in clade I.1 contributed to the broadest expression in rice but to clade I.2 in Arabidopsis, in which the functional significance was unknown. One possible functional shift might involve seed development. According to our microarray analysis, only two genes in Arabidopsis were apparently expressed in the embryo and no gene was observed to be expressed in endosperm; this differs profoundly from the strong expression observed in rice and sorghum (Fig. 4, Supplementary Figs S3 and S5).By way of contrast, the expression of the nsLTP genes of type V was observed primarily in relation with the vascular bundles, which was functionally unclear. Similar expressions of nsLTP genes were previously suggested to be involved in vascular differentiation.41 Furthermore, the functions related to vascular specificity were demonstrated in the study of DIR1, a 7 kDa nsLTP, which releases a systemic signal responsible for systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in the vascular system.15 A mutation of the AZI1 gene, which is induced by azelaic acid, also resulted in the specific loss of systemic immunity in priming defences. In these studies, it was supposed that nsLTPs could bind to signal molecules and translocate SAR signals at long distance.15,16 Interestingly, our promoter–reporter approach demonstrated that Sb08g002700 in clade I.1 also evidenced expression in vascular tissue (Fig. 4E13), which indicates the possible functional redundancy between type I and type V nsLTPs.4.4. Possible retention mechanisms of the OsLTP genes under concerted evolutionCompared with sorghum, the concerted evolution of the genomic segment between rice chromosomes 11 and 12 resulted in the retention of six pairs of tandem nsLTP copies in clade I.1. As previously hypothesized, rounds of inter-locus gene conversion between homeologous chromosome segments might be responsible for this concerted evolution status.32 How to interpret the functional redundancy/divergence and evolutionary mechanisms of these co-evolved genes after duplication remains unanswered.Gene conversion mediates the unequal transfer of genetic information between highly similar paralogous counterparts, and the key role of gene conversion in maintaining the high level of sequence homogeneity between the tandemly repeated ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes in eukaryotes has been widely reported.42,43 In the present study, the highly similar sequences between OsLTPs paralogs were observed in both coding and non-coding regulatory regions, which differ in extant according to gene pairs. With a cluster of highly conserved nsLTP genes preserved, we propose that the functional significance of the concerted evolution should be apparent at the expression level. All of the tested OsLTP gene promoters in clade I.1 showed that cuticle-related expression was highly conserved in the young leaves/shoots, wound site, and abscission zone, even though two genes (Os12g02340 and Os11g02389) lost the most expression motifs; however, two sorghum genes (Sb08g002660 and Sb08g002700) lost this expression feature, indicating a more divergent regulatory system. One piece of evidence supporting this notion is that Os11g02350 and Os12g02300 maintained almost identical tissue-specific expression in epidermal cells of the youngest aerial tissue, wound site, ovary, stigma, sillique, and seed, whereas the ortholog of Sb08g002700 was expressed principally in the vascular bundle of the rosette and shoot. Furthermore, the Sb08g002660 did not evidence most profound expression in young growing leaves; instead, extensive activities were in old leaves (Fig. 4B2). These lines of evidence indicate that the gene conversion between nsLTP homeologs in rice favoured the preservation of crucial expression motifs. Several nsLTP promoter deletion analyses have revealed that the proximal promoter region close to the start codon should be essential to drive the epidermis-specific expression.18,44,45 On a genetic basis, gene conversion should help to preserve the sequence of the proximal promoter region under high selective constraints, which only occur between highly similar sequences, and always at >92%.42 This is probably reasonable in light of our result that most orthologous pairs could retain high sequence similarity at the proximal promoter region at different extents, resulting in slow evolution with a relatively non-divergent tissue-specific expression of OsLTPs in clade I.1. Thus, the sequence homogenization process driving concerted evolution may preserve sequence similarity by removing deleterious mutations that slow the evolution of these genes and the crucial expression pattern.However, the expression preservation effect of concerted evolution could not explain all of our data. Indeed, the sequence homogenization induced by illegitimate recombination again results in redundancy in gene pairs, which may lead to relatively rapid mutation accumulation. The rapid evolution of this gene cluster could be explained by classical evolutionary mechanisms and was supported by the results of genetic-level studies.1,3 Although several expression motifs were well conserved in our promoter–reporter assay, large dynamics were also observed, including the fact that the expression in the anther, ovary, silique, and seed were frequently lost by individual genes in clade I.1 (Fig. 4), which implies a regulatory subfunctionalization process. Unlike the proximal promoter region essential to drive the conserved expression, the further upstream sequences were under relatively relaxing selection constraints, wherein other cis-motifs might be localized to affect the expression at different organs. This hypothesis is further supported by our RT–PCR analysis against abiotic stresses. When compared the sorghum orthologs, the rice homeologous gene pairs in clade I.1 extensively lost inducibility under drought, salt, and cold stresses. Although a total of 13 OsLTP genes and 5 SbLTP genes were preserved in clade I.1, the numbers of highly expressed genes and genes in response to drought, salt, and cold were comparable between rice and sorghum. Therefore, we suggest that the preservation of greater numbers of nsLTP genes in rice by concerted evolution also evidenced functional redundancy, and might have resulted in extensive regulatory subfunctionalization under relatively relaxed selection pressures.5. ConclusionsThe diversity of 9 kDa nsLTPs appear to have undergone long-term evolution in land plants and expanded in angiosperms after diving into different groups with fixed cysteine positions. In rice and sorghum, most nsLTP genes of type I evidenced a conserved expression feature related to the epidermal cells of young aerial growing tissues, supporting the notion of functional involvement in cuticle synthesis or plant defence against phytopathogens. Broad expression of this type was also observed frequently in the stigma, implying functional involvement in pollen–pistil interaction. In clade I.1, a grass-specific lineage, a possible functional shift is proposed in seed development, as strong expression in embryo and endosperm was detected in both rice and sorghum. By way of contrast, a vascular tissue-related expression pattern was primarily observed in type V, with a possible functional involvement in signal transduction. In rice, the major expression of OsLTPs in type I is attributed to the concerted evolution of six duplicated gene pairs on the distal region of rice chromosomes 11 and 12, whereas only five full gene copies were preserved on the orthologs chromosomes in sorghum. The gene conversion event possibly responsible for this concerted evolution status in rice resulted in the preservation of crucial expression under high selection constraints; however, extensive regulatory subfunctionalization followed by functional divergence was suggested to have occurred under relative low selection constraints in members of this gene cluster.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) funded by the Ministry of Education, Science, and Technology (2009-0064150) to CSJ.Supplementary data"

IntroductionHigh salinity is one of the most severe environmental stresses causing crop yield reduction. The ability of plants to develop salt tolerance is a trait governed by multigenes and is a determining factor in their growth and productivity.1 Among the intertwining physiological and molecular mechanisms, the regulation of gene expression plays a pivotal role in plant salt tolerance,2,3 and it has therefore stimulated increasing efforts on global expression profiling for various plant species over the past decade.The early insights into transcriptome responses were primarily obtained from the glycophytic model plants and major crops such as Arabidopsis,4,5 rice,6,7 and maize,8,9 in which hundreds of potential salt-responsive genes were identified and analysed to determine their expression patterns under salt treatments. The studies on glycophytes also revealed the involvement of several signal transduction pathways in salt stress response, including the salt overly sensitive (SOS) pathway, the ABA signalling pathway, the ethylene signalling pathway, and the Ca2+-dependent signalling pathway.10–13 These pathways constitute a dynamic network and work collectively to combat ionic disequilibrium, osmotic imbalance, and other deleterious effects of salt stress. However, most glycophytes can only endure relatively low concentrations of salt. For example, Arabidopsis cannot survive NaCl concentrations higher than 200 mM.14 Therefore, the transcriptome analyses of these glycophytes would miss the information about some key genes or pathways that are related to salt tolerance.To broaden the knowledge on the regulatory network for plant salt tolerance, the focus of recent transcriptomic research has been gradually shifting from the salt-sensitive glycophytes to the salt-tolerant halophytes. Salt cress (Thellungiella halophila) is the most commonly surveyed halophyte because its high nucleotide sequence identity with Arabidopsis cDNA facilitates the use of molecular and genetic tools that are available for Arabidopsis. Comparisons of the expression profiles between these two species demonstrated that they possessed both shared and divergent responses to salt stress, and the constitutive overexpression of many genes that were stress-inducible in Arabidopsis might contribute to the stress tolerance of salt cress.15,16 These findings are partly in accordance with the hypothesis that salt tolerance mechanisms are largely conserved in halophytes and glycophytes, and that the large variations in their tolerance arise from subtle differences in the regulation of the same basic set of genes.17 In other words, the formation of salt tolerance is a cumulative process with stepwise changes in gene regulation. Therefore, the salt-induced response of the transitional species between glycophytes and halophytes may provide new insights into the acquisition of salt tolerance. Nevertheless, the transcriptomic profiles of such transitional species are still not documented.Millettia pinnata is a semi-mangrove (also called ‘mangrove associate’) that can grow in either freshwater or seawater habitats. A recent study regarding the differentiation between true mangroves and semi-mangroves based on their leaf traits and salt contents proposed M. pinnata to be a glycophyte with moderate salt tolerance.18 Unlike other mangrove species, M. pinnata does not exclude salt via ultra-filtration system at its root surface, excrete salt through glands on its leaf surface, or develop succulence leaf. However, this plant can still endure salinity up to 3%.19,20 In the absence of specialized morphological and physiological traits, the adaptation of M. pinnata may be more exclusively attributed to the alternation in gene regulation, which makes M. pinnata extremely attractive for investigating on its transcriptomic adjustments under salt stress.As an outbreeding diploid (2n = 2x = 22) legume, M. pinnata has high levels of seed oil and has received much attention on its applications in biodiesel.21–23 In addition, its biomedical properties have also been investigated because it was traditionally known as a medicinal plant.24,25 However, the genetic background of this non-model species remains largely unknown. To date, only a few genes, such as the phytochrome A (PHYA) gene, the maturase (matR) gene, and the ribosomal RNA gene, have been sequenced from M. pinnata, and none of these genes have been shown to be directly responsible for its salt tolerance.26–28 This situation might now be changed with the introduction of next-generation massively parallel sequencing technologies developed by Roche/454 Life Sciences and Illumina.29,30 These sequencing-based approaches do not rely on the prior knowledge of genomic sequences, hence they are particularly useful in quantifying transcriptomes for non-model organisms.31In this study, we initiated a comprehensive transcriptome analysis of M. pinnata based on the Illumina sequencing platform. Our goals were to (i) set up a data set with abundant transcript sequences from the root and leaf tissues of M. pinnata, (ii) screen out genes with differential expression under seawater and freshwater treatments as candidate salt-responsive genes, and (iii) generalize the common and tissue-specific patterns of transcriptomic responses to salt stress in M. pinnata. The characterization of the transcriptome changes in this transitional species may provide useful complements to the understandings of molecular mechanisms underlying plant salt tolerance. The candidate genes identified in this study can be applied to molecular breeding for plants with enhanced salt tolerance.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant growth and salt treatmentsThe seeds of M. pinnata were obtained from the Dongzhaigang National Nature Reserve in Hainan, China. The field-collected seeds were surface-sterilized with a 75% ethanol solution, rinsed with sterilized distilled water, and sown in sterilized cover soil for germination. The seedlings were grown in plastic pots under a 12/12 h photoperiod at 25°C (day) and 18°C (night). The volume of each plant pot is ~800 ml. For the salt treatment, a group of 3-week-old plants were watered by seawater with a salinity of 3% (w/v, ~500 mM NaCl). The treatments were initiated at 8:00 a.m., at which time each individual plant was watered with 300 ml of seawater to field capacity. Meanwhile, a group of control plants were watered with an equal amount of freshwater (distilled water).2.2. Sample collection and RNA preparationThe roots and leaves were sampled at 2, 4, and 8 h after the application of seawater or freshwater. At each time point, the primary root with some lateral roots and three leaves at the shoot apex were simultaneously collected from each individual plant, and were separately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C prior to RNA extraction. The total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) following the manufacturer's instructions. The quality of RNAs was determined with a 2100 Bioanalyzer RNA Nanochip (Agilent Technologies). For each sample, at least 20 µg of total RNAs was sent to the Beijing Genomics Institute for Illumina sequencing (commercial service). For the reverse transcription–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) and real-time PCR experiments, the total RNAs were prepared following the aforementioned procedures.2.3. Sequencing and assemblyFor a given tissue, equal amounts of total RNAs from the plants treated for 2, 4, and 8 h were pooled in a combined sample. Totally, four combined samples were collected and denoted as MpRs, MpRf, MpLs, and MpLf according to the tissues (Root or Leaf) and the treatments (seawater or freshwater) of their sampling sources. For each combined sample, mRNAs were purified using oligo(dT)-attached beads and fragmented into small pieces (100–400 bp). The cleaved RNA fragments were then primed with random hexamers and submitted to the synthesis of the first-strand and second-strand cDNAs. The synthesized cDNAs were ligated with paired-end adaptors. Then, the cDNA fragments with 200 bp (±20 bp) size were selected by agarose gel electrophoresis and enriched by PCR amplification. Finally, four cDNA libraries were constructed for sequencing on an Illumina GA IIx. All sequence data have been deposited in the Short Read Archive (SRA) at the NCBI database under the project accession number SRA046342.1.After sequencing, the raw sequence data were first purified by trimming adapter sequences and removing low-quality sequences. The resulting clean reads were assembled using the SOAPdenovo program (version 1.04; http://soap.genomics.org.cn/soapdenovo.html) with K-mer size set to 29 bp.32 The clean reads were split into smaller pieces, the K-mers, and were conjoined into contigs using the de Bruijn graph. Next, the contigs from the same transcript were identified by paired-end reads and were connected into scaffolds. Then the gap fillings were carried out using the pair-end information to retrieve read pairs with one read well aligned on the contigs and another read located in the gap region. The resulting scaffolds with least Ns were defined as unigenes. The unigenes assembled by short reads from four samples were further clustered into all-unigenes in a comprehensive transcriptome using TGI Clustering Tool (TGICL) with the parameters of 50 bp overlap and a minimum of 90% identity.332.4. Data analysisThe sequence orientations of the all-unigenes were determined by BLASTx against the NCBI non-redundant (Nr) protein database, the Swiss-Prot protein database, the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database, and the Cluster of Orthologous Groups (COG) database. The incongruent results from different databases were settled under a priority order of Nr, Swiss-Prot, KEGG, and COG. For the rest all-unigenes that were unaligned to the above databases, ESTScan was used to predict their sequence orientations.34For assignments of gene descriptions, the all-unigenes were searched against the Nr database using BLASTx with an E-value cut-off of 1.0e–5. The BLAST results were parsed by a Perl script (available on request). The results of only the best hit were extracted. In practice, the E-values for more than 85% of the annotated sequences were =1.0e–10. Based on their Nr annotations, the all-unigenes were assigned GO annotations using Blast2GO (http://www.blast2go.rog/),35 followed by functional classification using the WEGO software.36 Besides, the putative metabolic pathways for the all-unigenes were assigned by performing BLASTx against the KEGG pathway database with the E-value cut-off of 1.0e–5.The RPKM (reads per kilobase per million reads) values were applied to measure the gene expression levels.37 For a given all-unigene, four RPKM values were generated by mapping the reads from the four subtranscriptomes to it using SOAP2 with a maximum of three mismatches.38 Only the reads mapped to a single all-unigene were used to estimate the expression level. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the seawater- and freshwater-treated samples were identified using an R package named ‘DEGseq’.39 The GO enrichment analysis and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for the DEGs were both performed by conducting hypergeometric tests with the whole M. pinnata transcriptome set as the background.2.5. RT–PCR and real-time PCR analysesWe conducted RT–PCR for 100 DEGs using the M. pinnata actin and 18S rRNA genes as the controls. The first-strand cDNAs were synthesized from 1 µg of total RNAs using the PrimeScript® 1st Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (TAKARA). The gene-specific primers were designed based on the sequencing results using the Primer Premier software (version 6.0). Then, the 20 µl of PCR samples containing 1 µl of first-strand cDNAs and 1 µl of primers were subjected to 35 cycles of 30 s denaturing at 94°C, 30 s annealing at the temperature that was altered for different DEGs, and 30 s extending at 72°C. The PCR products were electrophoresed on a 1% agarose gel.The real-time PCR was performed on an ABI PRISM 7300 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) using 1 µl of first-strand cDNAs and SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ (TAKARA). The thermal cycling conditions were 30 s at 95°C, followed by 40 cycles of 5 s at 95°C and 31 s at 60°C. All of the reactions were performed in triplicate. The relative expression levels for each gene were calculated using the 2-<U+0394><U+0394>CT method with normalization to the internal control gene. The LSD-t test of one-way analysis of variance was performed to determine the significant differences in expression levels between the treated samples at 1, 2, 4, and 8 h and those at 0 h using the SPSS software package (version 13.0).3. Results3.1. Illumina sequencing and de novo assemblyOur preliminary experiments showed that the young leaves of the M. pinnata plants treated with seawater began to wilt at 2 h, wilted to the greatest extent at 4 h, and almost completely recovered by 8 h after the treatments. Meanwhile, the control plants showed no symptoms during the course of the freshwater treatments. This result indicates that M. pinnata may suffer severe salt stress at 4 h, but it may overcome this stress by 8 h. We performed high-throughput sequencing of four samples, i.e. MpRs and MpRf from the roots, MpLs and MpLf from the leaves. For a broad survey of the salt-responsive genes, a combined cDNA library was constructed for each sample, which was represented by a transcript mixture with equal amounts of total RNA from 2, 4, and 8 h-treated plants. The Illumina sequencing was then performed separately for four cDNA libraries and generated four sub-transcriptomes with 75-bp raw reads. After filtration of low-quality and adapter sequences, nearly 192 million clean reads were remained for the four sub-transcriptomes. The percentage of Q20 bases for the clean reads in the four sub-transcriptomes were all ~93% (Supplementary Table S1). In total, these clean reads constitute ~12 GB of sequence data.The clean reads from the MpRs, MpRf, MpLs, and MpLf sub-transcriptomes were assembled into 248 011, 238 722, 194 806, and 194 020 contigs, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). The average contig sizes of the four sub-transcriptomes were all above 200 bp. The following step used the paired-end reads to identify the contigs from the same transcript, and these contigs were merged into 130 027, 127 341, 101 737, and 104 087 scaffolds with an average size over 350 bp (Supplementary Table S2). The scaffolds were further processed by a gap-filling step, which resulted in 78 062, 78 165, 63 081, and 64 436 unigenes for MpRs, MpRf, MpLs, and MpLf, respectively (Fig. 1). The numbers of unigenes obtained from the root samples were larger than those from the leaf samples, whereas the mean lengths of the unigenes were longer in the latter samples than those in the former ones (Table 1). Statistics for the unigenes of M. pinnataMpRs, MpRf, MpLs, and MpLf represent four sub-transcriptomes that were derived from two tissues (Root or Leaf) under two treatments (seawater or freshwater).

The steps include sequence assembly and clustering, Nr annotation, GO annotation, KEGG analysis, and identification of DEGs as candidate salt-responsive genes.Under the clustering criteria with a minimum of 50-bp overlap and 90% identity, the unigenes from all four sub-transcriptomes were further clustered into 108 598 all-unigenes to form a comprehensive transcriptome of M. pinnata (Fig. 1). The gene number showed a substantial increase from the sub-transcriptome to the comprehensive transcriptome, and the increase was more prominent for the genes with larger sizes (Table 1). The length of the all-unigenes ranged from 200 to 10 843 bp, with the mean length and the N50 value rises to 606 and 887 bp, respectively. As a result of the increase in both gene number and gene length, the total length of the all-unigenes extended to 65.8 Mb after clustering (Table 1). A total of 49 836 (45.9%) all-unigenes were clustered by at least two unigenes, with a maximum of 31 unigenes per all-unigenes, whereas the rest 58 762 (54.1%) were corresponding to single unigene from any of the four sub-transcriptomes. The average sequencing depth calculated by realigning all usable sequencing reads to the all-unigenes were ~30-folds for each sample. The quality of these all-unigenes was evaluated by two analyses: (i) the random distribution of reads in the all-unigenes showed that the all-unigenes were evenly covered by the reads from each sub-transcriptome with relatively fewer reads in the 3' ends of them (Supplementary Fig. S1), and (ii) the gap distribution of the all-unigenes indicated that the majority of them displayed a ratio of gap length to gene length <5% (Supplementary Fig. S2).3.2. Gene annotation and functional classificationFirst, the all-unigenes of M. pinnata were assigned putative gene descriptions based on the BLAST search against the NCBI non-redundant (Nr) protein database. Out of the 108 598 all-unigenes, 54 596 (50.3%) showing significant similarity with proteins in the Nr database were assigned Nr annotations (Fig. 1). Overall, these all-unigenes matched 24 281 unique protein accessions, which indicated that our sequencing project had generated a substantial number of genes for M. pinnata. Only 33.2% of the all-unigenes with a length <500 bp had BLAST hits in the Nr database. The proportion of all-unigenes with BLAST hits increased markedly for those with larger sizes (Fig. 2). It seemed that longer all-unigenes were more likely to have Nr annotations. The E-value distribution of the top hits in the Nr database also revealed that a larger proportion of all-unigenes longer than 500 bp had strong homology (E-value =1.0e–50) (Supplementary Fig. S3). Length distribution of the all-unigenes with Nr annotations. In this study, only 33% of the all-unigenes shorter than 500 bp had BLAST hits in the Nr database, whereas more than 80% of the all-unigenes over 500 bp did.Length distribution of the all-unigenes with Nr annotations. In this study, only 33% of the all-unigenes shorter than 500 bp had BLAST hits in the Nr database, whereas more than 80% of the all-unigenes over 500 bp did.The majority of these annotated all-unigenes (54 266 out of 54 596) displayed the highest homology to genes from plants (Table 2). A quarter of them retrieved an annotation from Arabidopsis, partly due to the fact that the Arabidopsis genome annotation is the most advanced and complete for any higher plant to date in the Nr database. Besides, there were also a quarter of annotated all-unigenes with matched accessions from its legume relatives (Table 2). The remaining <1% of annotated all-unigenes were annotated with sequences from the non-plant sources. Interestingly, we found 12 all-unigenes with an Nr annotation from Phytophthora sojae, which is a plant pathogen that causes soybean stem and root rot.40 Accordingly, we verified that all of these 12 all-unigenes were clustered by unigenes from the root-derived sub-transcriptome. This observation demonstrated a good representation of the comprehensive transcriptome in which even trivial amounts of pathogen transcripts were detected. Annotation sources for the all-unigenes of M. pinnata‘nr_plants’ and ‘nr_nonplants’ indicate the annotation sources from the NCBI non-redundant sequences for plants and non-plant species, respectively.Annotation sources for the all-unigenes of M. pinnata‘nr_plants’ and ‘nr_nonplants’ indicate the annotation sources from the NCBI non-redundant sequences for plants and non-plant species, respectively.Following their Nr annotations, we mapped the all-unigenes into the records of the GO database and retrieved GO annotations for 11 974 of them (Fig. 1). These all-unigenes were assigned GO terms from the three main categories, including 6407 all-unigenes with terms from ‘Biological process’, 7095 all-unigenes with terms from ‘Cellular component’, and 8299 all-unigenes with terms from ‘Molecular function’ (Fig. 3). Among them, 3228 all-unigenes had an assignment in all three categories. The remaining all-unigenes failed to obtain a GO term, largely due to their uninformative (e.g. ‘unknown’, ‘putative’, or ‘hypothetical’ protein) descriptions. Within the ‘Biological process’ category, the two most abundantly represented lineages were ‘metabolic process’ and ‘cellular process’. There were also a large number of genes involved in ‘biological regulation’, ‘pigmentation’, ‘localization’, and ‘response to stimulus’. In the ‘Molecular function’ category, ‘binding’ and ‘catalytic activity’ were predominantly represented. The former was mainly represented by genes for ‘nucleotide binding’ and ‘protein binding’, while the latter was mainly represented by genes with ‘transferase activity’, ‘hydrolase activity’, and ‘kinase activity’. In the ‘Cellular component’ category, most of all-unigenes were located in ‘cell part’. In contrast, rare all-unigenes were sorted into ‘extracellular region part’ or ‘virion part’. GO classification of M. pinnata transcriptome. The results are summarized in three main categories as follows: biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. In total, 11 974 all-unigenes have been assigned GO terms. In some cases, one all-unigene has multiple terms.GO classification of M. pinnata transcriptome. The results are summarized in three main categories as follows: biological process, cellular component, and molecular function. In total, 11 974 all-unigenes have been assigned GO terms. In some cases, one all-unigene has multiple terms.Finally, we performed the KEGG pathway analysis to assign biological pathways to the all-unigenes. In total, 23 697 out of 108 598 (21.8%) all-unigenes were assigned 124 KEGG pathways (Fig. 1). These pathways belonged to 20 clades under five major KEGG categories, including ‘Metabolism’, ‘Genetic information processing’, ‘Environmental information processing’, ‘Cellular processes’, and ‘Organismal systems’ (Fig. 4). Among them, ‘plant–pathogen interaction’, ‘spliceosome’, ‘biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids’, ‘biosynthesis of plant hormones’, and ‘ribosome’ were the top five pathways most represented by the all-unigenes. These results suggested that the living of M. pinnata was featured by dynamic metabolism as well as active environmental adaptation. Number of all-unigenes in each clade of the KEGG pathway maps. The all-unigenes were assigned 124 KEGG pathways within 20 clades under five major categories: Metabolism (I), Genetic information processing (II), Environmental information processing (III), Cellular processes (IV), and Organismal systems (V).

In each category, the clades are listed according to their abundancies of all-unigenes.3.3. Identification and functional classification of DEGsWe singled out the DEGs with two criteria for their expression profiles: (i) the average fold change in gene expression level was more than or equal to 2-fold between the seawater- and freshwater-treated samples and (ii) the false discovery rate of the single-sample t-test was <0.1%. Under these criteria, 23 815 out of 108 598 (21.9%) all-unigenes were identified to be differentially expressed in at least one tissue following the salt treatment (Supplementary Table S3; Fig. 1). In this study, DEGs with higher expression levels in seawater-treated samples when compared with freshwater-treated samples were denoted as ‘up-regulated’, while those with lower expression levels in seawater-treated samples were denoted as ‘down-regulated’. Overall, there were much more DEGs in the roots than those in the leaves (Fig. 5). In the root, the number of up-regulated DEGs was less than that of down-regulated DEGs. The situation was reversed in the leaf, in which more up-regulated DEGs than down-regulated DEGs were identified. Only a small portion of DEGs (1050 up-regulated and 622 down-regulated) shared common tendency of expression changes between the roots and the leaves. A still less of DEGs showed a completely opposite tendency of expression changes between the two tissues (577 DEGs up-regulated in the leaf but down-regulated in the root, and 157 DEGs down-regulated in the leaf but up-regulated in the root). The remaining majority of DEGs were exclusively up-regulated or down-regulated in either tissue. Number of DEGs in the root and the leaf of M. pinnata. The numbers of DEGs that were exclusively up- or down-regulated in one tissue are shown in each circle.

The numbers of DEGs with a common or opposite tendency of expression changes between the two tissues are shown in the overlapping regions. The total numbers of up- or down-regulated genes in each tissue are shown outside the circles.To further characterize the expression changes in these two tissues, we conducted GO enrichment analysis for the DEGs with the whole transcriptome set as the background. In the root, the significantly overrepresented GO terms of ‘Biological process’ were ‘gene expression’, ‘sulphur metabolic process’, ‘response to oxidative stress’, ‘cellular amino acid derivative metabolic process’, ‘oxidation reduction’, and ‘secondary metabolic process’ (Supplementary Table S4). In the leaf, the significantly overrepresented GO terms of ‘Biological process’ included ‘oxidation reduction’, ‘cellular amino acid derivative metabolic processes’, and ‘cellular aromatic compound metabolic process’. From these results, we noticed that both tissues of M. pinnata tend to mobilize genes related to oxidation reduction and cellular amino acid metabolism. Furthermore, as the salt-induced deleterious effects varied among different parts of a plant, the roots and the leaves also activated some distinct groups of genes (i.e. genes in ‘translation’, ‘sulphur metabolic process’, and ‘response to oxidative stress’ for the root, genes in ‘phenylpropanoid metabolic process’ for the leaf) to overcome them.The KEGG pathway enrichment analysis for the DEGs also revealed both common and tissue-specific patterns of overrepresentations. The DEGs were enriched in 37 pathways in the root and 31 pathways in the leaf (Supplementary Table S5). Among them, 19 pathways appeared in both tissues and were mostly related to amino acid metabolism, lipid metabolism, energy metabolism, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and environmental adaptation. Generally speaking, this finding demonstrated that both tissues of M. pinnata demand more energy and more biological substances to cope with salt stress. In addition to these common pathways, there were some tissue-specific pathways with overrepresented DEGs. For example, in the clade of ‘Energy metabolism’, the leaves of M. pinnata were enriched with DEGs in ‘oxidative phosphorylation’ and ‘photosynthesis’ pathways, and these processes were also employed by the leaves of other plant species under salt stress.41–43 On the other hand, the roots of M. pinnata were enriched with DEGs in the ‘sulphur metabolism’ pathway, which was likely related to their sulphur-rich living conditions.443.4. Experimental verification of DEGsTo assess the reliability of our sequencing-based approach in identifying salt-responsive genes, we monitored the expression of candidate DEGs. In the first place, we performed RT–PCR for 100 randomly chosen candidates with specific primers (Supplementary Table S6). We compared gene expression levels at the three time points separately between stressed and control samples. The expression profiles of 70 candidates were basically in agreement with the predictions from the Illumina sequencing results. Six candidates displayed incongruent expression profiles with the predictions. The remaining 24 candidates showed non-specifically amplified products or no products. In other words, 70–92% of the candidates were confirmed by RT–PCR analyses. The confirmed candidates were differentially expressed in at least one of the three time points (Supplementary Fig. S4). In the root, the maximal number of confirmed DEGs occurred at the 4 h time point (Supplementary Table S7). Conversely, the minimal number of confirmed DEGs in the leaf occurred at the 4 h time point, whereas the maximum occurred at the 8 h time point. From these results, we can infer a delay of transcriptional response to salt stress in the leaf, which may be explained by a later salt accumulation in this tissue.9In the second place, we employed real-time PCR to delineate the detailed expression profiles of 20 candidate DEGs. These candidates mainly included genes that were reported to be related to salt stress response in other plant species, such as genes involved in several signal transduction pathways, genes associated with osmotic adjustments or detoxification of reactive oxygen species (ROS), and genes encoding transcription factors (Supplementary Table S8). Besides, there were three candidates with unknown functions, which represented a new resource for gene transfer from M. pinnata to its legume relatives or other crops.All of these 20 candidates showed significantly differential expression with the original expression level in at least one time point following the seawater treatments (Fig. 6). In other words, all candidates displayed an expression pattern roughly consistent with the prediction based on the Illumina sequencing results. In most cases, the expression changes were more dramatic in the roots than in the leaves. Besides, most of the candidates were up-regulated from the 0 to 4 h time point, and then they gradually restored to the original expression levels. The pace of the rise and fall in gene expression levels was roughly coincident with the wilting and recovering of the young leaves. This phenomenon was also observed in other mangroves,42 and could be explained by referring to the different phases of salt stress response.43 The up-regulation and restoration of the DEGs in both tissues may parallel the phases of ‘salt accumulation’ and ‘osmotic recovery’, and the delay in gene activation in the leaves may result from an extra phase of ‘dehydration’ preceding the above two phases. The leaves wilted during the ‘dehydration’ phase, and then revived gradually during the following two phases. In this sense, these results again demonstrated that a later salt accumulation was responsible for the delay in the transcriptional response in the leaves. Relative expression levels of 20 DEGs at a series of time points following the seawater treatments. The relative gene expression levels as expressed by 2-<U+0394><U+0394>CT were determined separately for each tissue and were presented as the mean ± SD. Significant differences (P < 0.01, LSD-t test) between the expression levels at 1, 2, 4, and 8 h time points and those at 0 h are indicated by asterisks.Relative expression levels of 20 DEGs at a series of time points following the seawater treatments.

DiscussionMangroves are a group of plant species that live along the sea coast with the ability to tolerate high salinity.44 The extremely high salinity within their living conditions confers mangroves unique resources for exploiting the dynamic nature of their gene regulation during salt exposure. While the collections of ESTs based on cDNA libraries from several mangrove species have been described,45–47 the transcript data for such a plant group containing diverse species are still scarce. In a recent study using the 454 pyrosequencing platform, 67 375 and 96 989 unisequences with a mean length of 360 and 433 bp were produced for two taxonomically diverse mangroves.48 Compared with these results, our transcriptome for M. pinnata exceed in both the total number and the mean length of the unisequences. The mean length of the all-unigenes in our transcriptome was also longer than those reported for other plant transcriptomics using either the Illumina sequencing technology49,50 or the 454 pyrosequencing technology.51,52The enhancement in the gene length of our transcriptome may be attributed to various factors, such as the optimized assembly parameters (e.g. the K-mer size). One of the most important reasons for this enhancement might be that the final comprehensive transcriptome was indeed integrated by four sub-transcriptomes, each of which was comparable in gene number and gene length with those in the previous studies. The final unisequences possessed a relatively high depth of average coverage (~30-fold) by reads from each sub-transcriptome. We also noticed an increase in the number of unisequences from the sub-transcriptome to the comprehensive transcriptome. The ‘extra’ unisequences represented either splice variants or genes with tissue-specific or stress-specific expression. So far, our transcriptome for M. pinnata has presented many more sequences than the sequencing efforts for any other mangrove species have produced.53As for the GO and KEGG annotations, the aforementioned two mangrove species displayed remarkable similarities to each other.48 They both showed a lack of representation in the GO category ‘response to stimulus’, whereas the transcriptome of M. pinnata was well represented in this category. We suggest that this discrepancy may be partly attributed to the different status of adaptation for each mangrove species. It has been hypothesized that semi-mangroves represent an intermediate during the long-term evolution of mangroves in adaptation to the high-salinity environments.54 Accordingly, while those two mangroves that were ‘completely’ adapted to the extreme conditions did not require so many transcripts for responding to stimulus, M. pinnata with a ‘half’ tolerance may still be in great need of these transcripts. With the exception of this discrepancy, the functional categories were similar between M. pinnata and those two mangroves. For example, all these three species possessed large quantities of transcripts related to energy metabolism.Based on the comparison of gene expression levels between stressed and control samples using RPKM values, we screened out 23 815 all-unigenes as candidate salt-responsive genes, which took up ~22% of the total all-unigenes. This percentage was higher than the percentages of salt-induced DEGs derived from other related species, such as Bruguiera gymnorrhiza (another mangrove) and Medicago truncatula (another legume), using the array-based platform.41,55 First, the differences in DEG percentages might reflect the inherent differences between species in their transcriptome profiles. Secondly, it might reflect a greater sensitivity and higher resolution of the sequencing-based platform in identifying DEGs. The sequencing-based approaches offer several advantages over the existing hybridization-based approaches, which often suffer from background and cross-hybridization problems.56 Thirdly, since each sample for Illumina sequencing was pooled by equal amounts of RNAs from 2, 4, and 8 h-treated plants, the RPKM values in each sub-transcriptome actually reflected the average gene expression levels for the three time points. Theoretically speaking, our methods would miss some genes with 2-fold difference in expression levels between stressed and control samples at less than two time points due to the diluting effect of the pooled samples. Nevertheless, it could help us to detect genes with more dramatic changes (4-fold or greater) in expression levels at even only one time point, which might be more closely related to salt stress response. Lastly, we still should not neglect the possibilities of falsely discovered DEGs through the sequence-based platform. In our study, both RT–PCR and real-time PCR analyses demonstrated a high reliability of the candidate salt-responsive genes identified by sequencing-based approach.The DEGs identified in M. pinnata were enriched in the pathways related to protein synthesis and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. A comparative study between glycophyte and halophyte showed that Arabidopsis adopted a global defence strategy that requires bulk protein synthesis, whereas salt cress mainly activated genes that functioned in protein modification and redistribution.16 It seemed that protein modification might be a faster mechanism for stress response than protein synthesis. In this aspect, M. pinnata was more similar to glycophytes. On the other hand, salt cress showed a salt-induced increase in secondary metabolites,16 which were also found to accumulate in M. pinnata but not in Arabidopsis. Taken together, these two results suggest that M. pinnata can utilize the adjustment mechanisms preferentially adopted by either glycophytes or halophytes.In conclusion, we characterized a comprehensive transcriptome of a semi-mangrove plant M. pinnata using the Illumina sequencing technology. This transcriptome will not only provide plenty of informative data, but also expand the vision of the genetic basis underlying adaptation for the mangrove community. The candidate salt-responsive genes identified in M. pinnata contain both the previously reported salt-responsive genes and some species-specific genes which will be a new resource for molecular breeding in legumes or other crops. The functional enrichment analyses for the candidate genes showed both common and tissue-specific patterns of transcriptome remodelling under salt treatments. Moreover, the experimental analyses for some candidate genes provided some evidences for a delay in transcriptional responses in the leaves. Our work has demonstrated a high reliability of the sequencing-based approach in identifying stress-responsive genes in non-model organisms and established a connection between glycophytes and halophytes in the views of transcriptomic adjustments to salt stress.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the National Basic Research Program of China (2012CB114200), the Startup Project of Marine Biotechnology from Shenzhen University, and the National Transgenic Research Project (2009ZX08004-006B).We appreciate Mr Shichuan Li from the Dongzhaigang National Nature Reserve for assistance in collecting the seeds of M. pinnata.

We devised and verified such a tool using a quantitative competitive polymerase chain reaction approach. For this approach, we adapted a competitor array, an artificially made plasmid DNA in which all the competitor templates for the target DNAs are arranged with a defined ratio, and melting analysis for allele quantitation for accurate quantitation of the fractional ratios of competitively amplified DNAs.

IntroductionGene transcription levels have been measured by methods based on Northern analysis or reverse transcription (RT)–polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assays. These approaches are generally effective for comparing the RNA levels of any gene among many samples. However, these methods are unsuitable for comparing the quantitation data generated in different places or times, primarily due to the paucity of quantitation standardization. Comparing the expression levels of different genes is even more problematic, even though this task is important for understanding the coordinative nature of gene expressions and the relative strength of regulatory elements.1 Microarray technology and recent advancements in sequencing technology, such as RNAseq, have opened the way for a thorough examination of the expression of many RNAs; they also facilitate the visualization of relative expression levels of multiple genes.2,3 Nonetheless, these assays are yet to be tailored to attain sufficient accuracy or reproducibility between different assay platforms; they are also unsuitable for examining a small number of genes in numerous samples.4,5The quantitative competitive PCR (qcPCR) method measures the amount of target DNA of interest relative to the amount of an artificially made DNA competitor. With this measurement, the absolute quantity of the target DNA can be determined if the amount of the corresponding competitor is known.6,7 A single-nucleotide difference between two otherwise identical DNAs is the best competition structure that warrants the equal amplification efficiency of these dimorphic DNAs in the PCR. The resultant PCR amplicons have been analysed for the allele ratios in the samples using a wide range of application platforms including Maldi-TOF, pyrosequencing, and real-time DNA melting.8–11 However, qcPCR approach needs to deal with some inevitable uncertainties. The quantitation of the competitor templates or samples of interest is largely performed in a spectrophotometric manner; that is, the method takes into account the common measurement biases that occur between measurements and between laboratories.In this study, we present an alternative method of nucleic acid quantitation based on a qcPCR approach. With this method, the amount of a given sequence in a mixture such as cDNA or genomic DNA (gDNA) is determined in relation to the amount of another sequence in the mixture. To accomplish this task, we introduced a competitor array as a novel reaction component in the qcPCR. The competitor array is an artificially made plasmid DNA in which the competitor templates for the target DNAs in question are arranged with a defined aspect ratio. This structure of the competitor array enables one to infer the quantitative relation between two or more DNA sequences if the relative quantity of each sequence to its respective competitor templates in the competitor array is determined. We also exploited high accuracy and precision of the melting analysis for allele quantitation (MAAQ) method in determining the relative quantity of the target DNA with respect to the competitor template. The MAAQ method utilizes the differential melting patterns of either the fluorescent resonance energy transfer (FRET) probe encompassing on a single-nucleotide variation or restriction fragment length polymorphic DNAs. This method mathematically analyses the melting curve of a sample to extract the constitutional fraction with which each allelic version contributes to the curve.10,11 It offers a simple and rapid procedure as it does not require post-PCR purification or additional biochemical reactions while ensuring high accuracy and precision. In addition, the MAAQ analysis can be performed with a relatively less expensive device than other methods. Various exemplary assays are presented to emphasize the validity and versatility of this method in the field of nucleic acid quantitation.2. Materials and methods2.1. PlasmidsThe plasmid DNAs containing a single target or competitor template were made by TA cloning of the corresponding PCR amplicons into pCR2.1 (Invitrogen) so that the inserted fragments could be liberated with EcoRI restriction. Competitor template was generated by PCR amplification by applying a mismatch-carrying primer. Plasmid DNAs containing multiple template sequences which were used for an equimolar mixture of the target and competitor template and for the competitor arrays were constructed by a means of a single or repeated subcloning process. For the subcloning, a SpeI/XbaI fragment of a plasmid was placed into the XbaI or SpeI site of another plasmid. Plasmids that contained any form of an inverted repeat were avoided. Further information on the plasmids used in this study is presented in Supplementary Table S5.2.2. RT and PCRRT was carried out on 1 µg of the total RNA with an iScript™ cDNA synthesis kit (BioRad) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. PCR was performed with ~0.2 µl of the reverse transcribed cDNA template, 20 ng of gDNA or 0.1 pg of plasmid DNA for appropriate analyses and 0.5 µM of corresponding primer pairs: G6pd-1F and G6pd-7R for G6pdx; Ubc-1F and Ubc-4R for Ubc; Rps-4F and Rps-2R for Rps27; Igf2-E1F1 and Igf2-E4R1 for the Igf2 P1 transcript; Igf2-E2F1 and Igf2-E4R1 for the Igf2 P2 transcript; Igf2-E3F1 and Igf2-E4R1 for the Igf2 P3 transcript; and Igf2-E4F1(GTACCAATGGGGATCCCAGT) and Igf2-E4R1 for the Igf2 total transcript. Information on the primer sequences is presented in Supplementary Table S5. The competitor arrays were prepared by cleaving the corresponding plasmid and subsequently diluting it in water containing <U+03BB>phage DNA (1 ng/µl). For the competitive PCR, each template (except for the references) was mixed with its appropriate competitor array and amplified by PCR by using 40 cycles at 94°C for 10 s, 56°C for 20 s, and 72°C for 30 s.2.3. Melting analysisThe relative ratios of the target DNA to its competitor in the PCR amplicon were determined as previously described. Briefly, 5 µl of PCR amplicons were mixed with 5 µl of 10 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid and with 0.4 µM of FRET probes, Igf2-S1 and Igf2-A1 (see Fig. 1b) for Igf2; G6pdx-S, Red640-5'-GCACTG TTGGTGGAAGATGTCA-3', and G6pdx-A, 5'-CACACG GATGACCAGCTCATTACG-3'-FITC, for G6pdx; Ubc-S, Red640-5'-TACGTCTGTCTTCCTGTTTGAC-3', and Ubc-A, 5'-GGCTCTTTTTAGATACTGTGGTGAGG-3'-FITC, for Ubc; and Rps27-A, 5'-CCTTCTGATGA ATGTGGTGCTGGAG-3'-FITC and Rps27-S, Red640-5'-TCTGGGAAGCCACTTTGACAG-3', for Rps27. The DNA melting was performed with Roche LightCycler 2.0 under the following conditions: 30 s at 95°C; and 8 min at either 45°C (for Igf2, G6pdx, and Ubc) or 44°C (for Rps27) at 0.1°C stepwise increments in temperature until the probe's melting is completed. The background-subtracted fluorescence values (640/Back-530) from the Red640 dye were extracted with the aid of LightCycler Software 4.05 and then submitted for calculation as previously reported.11 The relative abundance of two sequences in each sample was determined from the ratio of the T/C values of the two comparing sequences after reflecting the copy numbers of their corresponding competitor templates in the competitor array used.

Results3.1. Determining the relative abundance of DNAs in simple mixturesFigure 1a depicts the typical procedure for determining the relative abundances of the sequences of interest in a mixture. To demonstrate the feasibility of this quantitation approach, we used it to determine the relative quantity of a cDNA sequence with respect to another sequence in the artificially made cDNA mixtures. A set of cDNA mixtures was composed through the construction of 10 plasmids (A–J); they contained variable numbers of each of the three cDNA fragments of mouse Ubc, Rps27, and G6pdx genes. Plasmids H and I were from independent clones with the same sequence composition. The relative abundances of the sequences in each plasmid are therefore explicitly known (Fig. 1b). Another plasmid DNA, the competitor array CA1, was made to contain a single copy of each competitor template, namely a single-nucleotide substituted version of the respective cDNA sequence. These plasmid DNAs were structured to liberate each cDNA fragment as a single entity upon EcoRI digestion (Fig. 1b). Each mixture generated by the EcoRI digestion of the corresponding plasmid was individually mixed with the EcoRI-restricted CA1 and subsequently subjected to competitive PCR reactions along with three standard templates, namely the target cDNA, the corresponding competitor template, and an equimolar mixture of the target cDNA and its competitor template. One of the fluorescently labelled FRET probes for each cDNA sequence was designed to span the nucleotide of variation between two competing templates so that the probe's melting from the complementary sequences are differentiated depending on the completeness of the base pairing. The melting curves that we generated from the PCR amplicons by applying the respective FRET probes were fed into the MAAQ process to determine the relative quantities of each target cDNA sequence with respect to the competitor template (T/C for short).Supplementary Table S1 presents the T/C values of each cDNA sequence (G6pdx/C, Ubc/C, and Rps27/C) in the cDNA mixtures; the quantities were determined from the quadruplicate PCR reactions. The abundances of a cDNA sequence relative to another (Rps27/G6pdx, G6pdx/Ubc, and Ubc/Rps27) in each mixture were then obtained from the ratios of the respective T/C values of the two sequences in question. Figure 1c shows a scattered plot of the observed versus expected values of the relative abundances; the plot highlights the accuracy of this assay. The average relative error for this assay is 0.059, demonstrating that our qcPCR approach can accurately assess the abundance of a sequence in relation to another sequence in a simple mixture.3.2. Determining the relative abundance of different DNAs in complex mixturesWe subsequently considered whether our approach would be reliable in the analysis of complex samples such as those that are likely to be encountered in a laboratory. To address this matter, we measured the copy number ratios of the autosomal Ubc and the X-linked G6pdx sequences in male and female gDNAs. We chose gDNA because it is a particularly complex mixture of sequences and provides a stringent test for our assay. The Ubc/G6pdx ratios were expected to be 1 and 2 for females and males, respectively. About 20 ng of each liver gDNA of five females and five males was mixed with 0.05 pg of CA1 and subjected to PCR reactions for two sequences. We then applied the MAAQ. Five XY samples have an average ratio of 1.978, and five XX samples have a ratio of 1.000 with an average relative error of 0.021. These results strongly confirm that this method can measure the relative abundances of the target DNAs, even in a highly complex mixture such as gDNA (Table 1). The relative abundance of nucleic acid species can be reliably calculated in gDNA samplesA sample of gDNA was prepared from the kidneys of 10 adult mice (five females: F1–F5 and five males: M1–M5). The relative abundance of the Ubc and G6pdx genes was then determined as described in the text. The terms <U+03B3>G6pdx and <U+03B3>Ubc are the proportions of the target sequences within the competitively amplified amplicons, and G6pdx/CA1and Ubc/CA1 are the relative ratios of the G6pdx and the Ubc sequences with respect to their corresponding competitors, respectively; the standard deviation (SD) is based on from three measurements; the term Obs/Exp refers to the ratios of the observed per expected values.aAverage relative error, 0.021.The relative abundance of nucleic acid species can be reliably calculated in gDNA samplesA sample of gDNA was prepared from the kidneys of 10 adult mice (five females: F1–F5 and five males: M1–M5).

Determining the tissue-specific expression signatures via the forms of relative abundance of cDNAsBecause of the proven accuracy and reliability of our method, we used it to obtain two types of biological data. The first type of data is the relative expression abundances among three housekeeping genes in different mouse tissues. A preliminary assessment using the serial dilutions of the CA1 on the tissue cDNAs indicates that the abundances of the Ubc and Rps27 transcripts are in an equivalent range whereas the abundance of G6pdx transcript is far less than those of the two transcripts (more than a hundredfold in some cases, data not shown). To accurately cover this wide range of expression levels, we made an additional competitor array, CA2, to carry the copies of G6pdx, Ubc, and Rps27sequences at a ratio of 1:7:7. The PCR amplicons of each sequence were generated by using a mixture of each cDNA and CA2 as a template. Subsequent analysis revealed the T/C values and the relative abundances among the target sequences (Supplementary Table S2). Figure 2a visualizes the relative abundances of two subjected sequences in the cDNAs of the liver, heart, and brain of three female adult mice. These results demonstrate the tissue-specific expression signatures of these three genes with forms of their relative transcript abundances; they also demonstrate the relatively small individual variations [which have a 0.125 coefficient of variation (CV)].

The values were averaged from four measurements. We determined three of the measurements from three independent RT reactions by adapting another version of competitor array, CA3, with the respective copy ratio of 1:9:9 for the sequences of G6pdx, Ubc, and Rps27. The CV of these measurements (0.079) confirms that our quantitation method has a high level of precision.3.4. Measuring the relative promoter strength of multiple promoters of a geneWe tried to obtain the relative transcriptional activity of the multiple Igf2 promoters in embryonic tissue. The utilization of multiple promoters for transcription is not rare in a eukaryotic system.12 The usage rate of each promoter could be the subject of developmental or tissue-specific regulations. If the promoter strength is linearly correlated with the cellular level of the transcript it drives, our assay scheme is well suited for assessing the relative strength among the promoters. This type of assessment provides insight into the relative promoter activity of the given samples and confirms the potential of our approach as a versatile quantitation method. Transcriptional regulation of the murine Igf2 gene is relatively well characterized with respect to the role and position of cis-regulatory elements, including promoters and enhancers.13 Fetal and neonatal Igf2 transcription is derived from multiple promoters, P1, P2, and P3, through appropriate interactions between regulatory sequences; these types of interactions provide a good model system for comparing the transcriptions of multiple promoters and specific interactions.14We conducted an assay in which each promoter-specific transcription was compared with the total level of Igf2 transcription in two embryonic tissues, the liver and muscle with endodermal and mesodermal origins, respectively. The primers were designed to span two consecutive exons to prevent any potential noise from gDNA contamination. The promoter specificity of the PCR amplicon was given by placing a part of the forward primers on the promoter-specific exons (Fig. 3a). The competitor templates for the promoter-specific amplification were made by placing only a single-nucleotide substitution on exon E4; they were then arranged into a plasmid to constitute the competitor array CA4. Each promoter-specific competitor was also used as the competitor for the entire Igf2 transcript by applying a new forward PCR primer placed on the 5'-end of the shared exon E4 (Fig. 3a). In this way, CA4 can be exploited in two different competitions with an aspect ratio of 1:3. One competition is for the promoter-specific transcript; the other is for the total transcript. Each cDNA was added to the CA4 and subsequently subjected to four separate PCR amplifications: three of the PCR amplifications were specific for the promoter-specific transcript and the other was used for the total transcript. After determining the T/C values of each PCR reaction, we obtained the relative abundance of each promoter-specific transcript with respect to the total Igf2 transcript; the results are presented in Fig. 3b and Supplementary Table S3. Promoter-specific transcriptions as measured in relation to the total transcription level. (a) The fetal Igf2 expression as derived from the promoters P1, P2, and P3. Each exon (E1, E2, and E3) constitutes a promoter-specific part of Igf2 mRNA that is spliced to the shared exon E4. The primers (arrows with dotted line in the middle) were designed to span two consecutive exons except for one forward primer, Igf2-E4F, which is placed on the 5'-most part of exon E4 to account for the total transcription of Igf2 and the common reverse primer. The detailed structure of the exon E4–exon E5 junction region regarding the positions of the reverse primers Igf2-E4R1 and Igf2-E4R2 and the FRET probes Igf2-A and Igf2-S is depicted in the lower part of the figure. (b) The relative quantities of the promoter-specific transcription with respect to the total transcription yield the relative abundance of each transcript in the samples. The relative transcript levels, which were measured from muscle tissue and liver tissue, represent the mesodermal and endodermal origins, respectively.Promoter-specific transcriptions as measured in relation to the total transcription level. (a) The fetal Igf2 expression as derived from the promoters P1, P2, and P3. Each exon (E1, E2, and E3) constitutes a promoter-specific part of Igf2 mRNA that is spliced to the shared exon E4.

(b) The relative quantities of the promoter-specific transcription with respect to the total transcription yield the relative abundance of each transcript in the samples. The relative transcript levels, which were measured from muscle tissue and liver tissue, represent the mesodermal and endodermal origins, respectively.The Igf2 transcription in the liver necessitates the involvement of an endoderm enhancer, whereas the muscle expression largely relies on a mesoderm enhancer. Our results confirm that minimal transcription activity occurs on promoter P1, regardless of which enhancer is involved; specifically, only 6–7% of the total transcript is attributed to promoter P1 activity in both the liver and muscle. On the other hand, the two types of tissue with developmentally different origins have different preferences with regard to the utilization of promoters P2 and P3: compared with P3, P2 has more transcription in the muscle but less in the liver. This difference indicates that the relative strength of the two promoters depends on the type of enhancers used. Moreover, the results confirm that this method is highly reproducible; the standard deviations of the measurements of three independent RT reactions are minute (ranging from 0.051 to 0.001, CV = 0.033).If exon E4 is spliced solely for the transcripts derived from the three promoters addressed here, the relative transcription levels of the three promoters should add up to 1. The fact that the aggregate transcription levels for the muscle samples are 1.010 and 1.008 is consistent with this notion. On the other hand, the aggregate transcription levels for the liver samples are 0.920 and 0.938. This difference may be attributed to the possible existence of one or more transcripts that contain exon E4 in the liver.4. DiscussionIn this study, we presented a qcPCR method that can be used to measure the relative abundances among the sequences of interest in any DNA sample. Because of the technical difficulty of obtaining a direct quantitative comparison between two unlinked sequences, we exploited the absolute relativity of their respective competitor templates which are arranged in the competitor array. In addition, the high accuracy of the MAAQ method was exploited for the quantitation of the fractional ratios of the competitively amplified DNAs. The relative abundances of two different sequences were consequently obtained in a series of plasmid constructs and gDNAs. These abundances turned out to be very accurate; the average relative errors of 0.059 and 0.021, respectively, confirm the reliability and practical feasibility of this approach.The quantitation scheme was further validated by its successful acquisition of biological data. We compared three housekeeping genes in terms of the abundances of their transcripts for multiple types of mouse tissue and analysed Igf2 expression in terms of the proportion of the promoter-specific transcript in the total Igf2 transcripts. These results efficiently illustrate the tissue-specific expression signatures of the three housekeeping genes and the relative transcriptional strength of the Igf2 promoters.With an exploitation of the high level of accuracy and precision, our method can potentially be used as a form of standardized quantitation. That is, the expression level of any gene of interest can be determined relative to the expression of a single gene or a combination of several reference genes in the same sample. Thus, our method can produce a stand-alone value for the transcription level of a gene in a particular sample. Furthermore, this value can readily be compared with other results that are independently generated by the same method at any place or time. In this regard, Ubc and Rps27 can be considered as reference genes because their relative transcript abundances were relatively constant in all the tested tissues. Our data also demonstrate that the assay remains robust across a wide range of expression levels (e.g. the G6pdx/Ubc value in liver is 0.005). This range can be further extended by applying a competitor array that contains the respective competitor templates with a larger aspect ratio.For the purpose of sharing and exchanging the quantitation data of the transcripts, various applications have been developed to present the quantities on an absolute scale such as copy numbers per cell.15,16 Miura et al.16 reported a qcPCR approach with which the transcription level of thousands of yeast genes were described as copy numbers per cell. Kanno et al.15 also presented a method to convert the microarray data or quantitative PCR data to copy numbers per cell. Both approaches utilize a series of standard RNAs which is spiked into the sample of interest in order to provide a way of calibration of inter-experiment differences or normalization of quantity data in the experimental sets. Although these approaches are effective in providing the structural architecture of transcriptome abundances on an absolute scale, it still requires standardization of standard RNAs in order to cross-refer those data to others that are independently generated. In this circumstance, it would be more practical to present the transcription level of a gene in relation to that of another in the same sample as we did. Many approaches including above two examples and others that are focused on defining copy number variation in the genomes are indeed capable of delineating the abundances of multiple sequences in the view of their relativity.17,18 However, the accuracy and the precision that these approaches can confer are not as high as those our method can, or were not addressed probably due to disregard of presenting the relative abundances of intergenic sequences.On the other hand, application of our method for the standardized quantitation is yet to address certain problems that are potentially caused by the differences in the cDNA conversion efficiency of individual RNAs and between the segments of a given RNA. The different reaction conditions or types of enzymes used for RT consequently produce variations in the relative quantity of given sequences in the cDNA pool. Nonetheless, our approach provides a way of examining the extent to which the relative abundance of those sequences varies on account of the different reaction conditions; it also provides a way of determining the best conditions for minimizing such variations.With simplicity, speed, and accuracy, our quantitation approach provides a straightforward paradigm for comparing gene expression levels across cell types, developmental stages, and even different species. Most importantly, with this approach, experiments performed in different laboratories or at different times can be correctly referenced to one another.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the National Research Foundation of Korea grant (NRF, No.20110027739) and a Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine grant (KIOM, No.K11070) funded by the Korea government (MEST).Supplementary data"

IntroductionTo date, more than 1000 prokaryotic species have been completely sequenced. These genome data provide an opportunity to conduct large-scale genome-wide studies in comparative genomics. Many analyses are carried out to explore eukaryotic genomes side by side, but not many comparative analyses are performed with prokaryotes. Even though prokaryotic organisms demonstrate recognizable, common architectural principles, they have a great variability in ecology and in metabolic and genomic complexity.1 For example, the lengths of sequenced bacterial genomes range from 180 kb (Carsonella ruddii)2 to 13 Mb (Sorangium cellulosum).3 Although a lot of this variability can be attributed to varying metabolic complexity, it also suggests that some species have more compact genomes than others. Large differences exist in the fraction of intergenic regions.1 The percentage of intergenic regions in the genomic sequence varies from ~5% (Thermotoga neapolitana, NC_011978) to 50% (Sodalis glossinidius, NC_007712). The median value of the fraction of intergenic regions per genome size is 12%.Though prokaryotic genomes are known to be compactly organized, there is still room for different repetitive sequences in them.4,5 There are very few comprehensive studies of repetitive sequences; most of the studies focus on specific types of repeats or on a limited number of bacterial species.4–8The processes generating repeats include duplication, horizontal gene transfer, transposition, and replicon fusion.1,5,9–17 These processes allow bacteria to adapt to environmental changes or to evolve into pathogens (owing to the distribution of genes encoding toxins, effector proteins, cell wall modification enzymes, fitness factors, and antibiotic and heavy metal resistance determinants).10 A large fraction of known types of repetitive sequences belong to integrative and conjugative elements, also known as mobilome.18,9 The mobilome consists of bacteriophages, plasmids, and transposable elements. It mediates the movement of DNA within and between genomes. Integrative elements play a key role in the emergence of infectious diseases, antibiotic resistance and other problems.1,19–21Thus, different mechanisms give rise to repeats and also different roles are suggested for repeats. Though many papers about completely sequenced prokaryotic genomes also try to analyze repetitive sequences, the characterization is frequently limited to some types of repeats (e.g. CRISPR, MITE, IS) or repeats as whole without classification.22,23 No exhaustive research about the characterization of prokaryotic species-specific repeats is published. However, as further shown, different types of species-specific repeats with different functions are present in prokaryotic genomes. At least some of them are the characteristic of a particular species (e.g. specific protein- biosynthesis-coding genes or specific bacterial toxins).We have previously reported the existence of species-specific repeats in several bacterial species of medical importance and we have developed a computational method for de novo detection of such repeats previously.24 However, two questions remain unanswered: do all species have species-specific repeats and can we associate these repeats with sequences other than mobile genetic elements?The first topic we cover in this paper is the general description of prokaryotic repeats. It is important for species characterization and identification to know what fraction of a prokaryotic genome contains repetitive DNA regions, how many of them are species-specific, and what is the common size range of the repetitive sequences. Our main focus is on species-specific repeats, with a few comparisons with universal repeats (definitions of these repeat types are given below, at the beginning of the ‘Results’ section).Thereafter, we focus on the functional characterization of species-specific repeats. The main interest here is whether species-specific repeats are reliable for use as target sequences in identifying a species or whether they are really only selfish elements or sequences with unknown function according to the common view. For this, different functional classes of repeats are distinguished. In this paper we use the following classes to describe repeats: (I) mobile genetic elements, (II) repeats associated with RNA genes, (III) repeats associated with protein-coding genes, and (IV) non-coding repeats.Finally, we discuss the different practical aspects of detecting prokaryotic repetitive sequences. The Supplementary material contains a list of all of the detected sequence-specific repeats.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genomic sequences usedTo identify prokaryotic repeats, DNA sequences for all completely sequenced prokaryotic chromosomes and plasmids were retrieved from the FTP site of the NCBI RefSeq (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria). The human genome (version NCBI36) was downloaded from Ensembl (ftp://ensembl.org/pub/). A full list of analyzed genomes and their basic features (genome length, superkingdom, number of chromosomes, number of plasmids, etc.) is provided in the Supplementary Table S3. In total, 876 chromosomal genomes (63 archaeal and 819 eubacterial) and 613 prokaryotic species (containing 54 archaeal and 561 eubacterial genomes) were analyzed. Of the 613 species, 95 are represented with more than one strain of chromosomal genome sequence. For 232 prokaryotic species at least one plasmid genome was available, 733 prokaryotic plasmid genomes were downloaded in total. The RefSeq accession numbers of the virus genomes used in the current work are provided in the additional files (Additional File 1: Supplementary Table S3). To find strain-specific repeats online, the NCBI BLAST database for microbes was used on genomic sequences with sequencing status ‘Complete, in Progress or Assembly’.2.2. Annotation dataTo explore the positions of prokaryotic repeats in relation to genes, gene coordinates were retrieved from the FTP site of the NCBI RefSeq (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria) for all analyzed prokaryotic chromosomal genomes.2.3. Method for identifying microbial repetitive sequencesThe method for finding microbial repeats has been described earlier.24 The availability of complete genome sequences for the species of interest is required in order to find repetitive regions. The species of interest is called the ‘target genome’ in this article. In the context of species-specific repetitive sequences, the ‘non-target genome’ is defined as genomic DNA sequence(s) of all other organisms not in the target genome group. In the case of bacterial species-specific repeats, all sequenced chromosomal genomes of prokaryotic species and their plasmid genomes were used as non-target genomes. In this study, the human genome was always used by default as one of the non-target genomes.To identify repeats, the genomic sequence of the target genome was segmented into consecutive windows. The length of a window was 100 bp and the length of overlap between consecutive windows was 50 bp. We also tested different length for the overlap (75 bp) to find species-specific repeats (50 randomly chosen species was used). However, no additional species-specific repeats could be found. Thus, to achieve smaller search time, we decided to use 50 bp for overlap. Matches of sequence windows inside the target genome were identified using the similarity search software BLAST. A sequence window was classified as a candidate repeat if the following two criteria were met: the length of the BLAST match in target genome was between 85 and 115 bp and the BLAST identity between the matching region and the query window was >80%. Thereafter, in the case of finding species-specific repeats, the specificity of candidate repeats was checked. A candidate repeat was defined as a non-species-specific repeat if the length of any BLAST match in any non-target genome had a length of at least 50 bp and the identity between the match of background sequence and the query window was >60%. Finally, overlapping candidate repeats were joined to form complete (species-specific) repeats. All scripts were written in the Perl programming language.2.4. Definition of length and number of copies of the repeatThe length of different copies of the same repeat is, to some extent, variable between species or between strains of the same species. In this analysis, the median length of all copies of a given repeat is shown as the length of the repeat. To define the copy number of a given species-specific repeat, the median value of all copy numbers of that repeat over the analyzed strains of that species was used. Similarly, the median copy number of particular repeat over different species where this repeat was present was used as the copy number of a universal repeat.2.5. Repetitive sequence functionality analysisFirst, we identified prophage regions using the Phage_finder program.25 After that, IS elements and transposons were identified from the ISfinder database26 and from RefSeq annotations. Next, a BLAST search against plasmid sequences (2473 completely sequenced plasmid genomes downloaded from the NCBI FTP site ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Plasmids) was conducted to find repeats of possible plasmidic origin. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) sequences were identified within repetitive sequences with CRISPRFinder.27 Intergenic repeat units (IRUs; ERIC/IRU sequences) were retrieved from the collection of short repeated palindromes (http://www.pasteur.fr/recherche/unites/pmtg/repet/intro.IRU.html).We used RefSeq gene annotation data for calculating how many species-specific and universal repetitive sequences cover genes (RNA genes and protein-coding genes) in more than 50% of the repeat length. Even if only one copy of a repeat contained a gene annotation then the repeat was considered a repeat associated with a gene (we assumed annotation faults are responsible for the missing annotation of other copies). The same logic was used to identify other features of the repeats except intergenic regions. None of the copies of intergenic repeats were allowed to contain any of the aforementioned features by more than 5% of the length of the repeated region.Finally, Pfam database was used to predict the functions of NCBI RefSeq hypothetical proteins.283. Results3.1. Definition of repeatsThroughout this paper, ‘repeats’ are defined as DNA sequences at least 85 bp long that are present in at least two copies in the genome of each strain of the species. Repeat copies within the same species are required to have at least 80% identity with each other. ‘Species-specific repeat’ is defined as a repeat that is present in only one species and there are no similar sequences (more than 60% identity over 50 bp or more) in chromosomes of other fully sequenced species. If more than one strain of a species has been sequenced, the species-specific repeat must be present in all strains, with at least two copies. The minimum length and homology cutoffs for repeat definition in this paper were chosen for practical reasons—to allow the design of species-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers for each identified repeat.24 Our methodology is also able to identify ‘strain-specific repeats’, but we deliberately chose not to analyze these in order to maintain the focus of this article on species-specific repeats.Some repeats are detected in more than one species. These can be further divided into ‘universal repeats’ and ‘intermediate repeats’. Universal repeat is a repeat that is present in at least two species (in both as a repeat) which must belong to different genera. Thus, universal repeats are repeats that are shared between some species of separate genera. For example, widely known universal repeats are ribosomal RNA genes and elongation factor Tu. All the rest of the repeats are defined as intermediate repeats. For example, intermediate repeat can be identified in one species as a repeat and can be present in one strain of another species with only one copy. Also intermediate repeats are repeats present in different species of one genus. In our analysis, we compare species-specific repeats to universal repeats; intermediate repeats are not analyzed further. Generally, intermediate repeats share characteristics of both universal and species-specific repeats.An additional difficulty in repeat definition comes from the existence of bacterial plasmids. Typically, people search for repeats in bacterial chromosome(s), but some repeat copies can also be located in plasmids. In our data set, 232 of 613 species contained plasmids. Some of these plasmids also contained species-specific repeats. However, the analysis of species-specific plasmidic repeats is unequivocal because plasmid transfer between different bacterial species is a common phenomenon.29,30 It has been shown that at least 51% of sequenced proteobacterial plasmids are transmissible.9 Thus, the plasmid-based repeats are not reliable targets for characterization of bacterial species. For this reason, we have omitted plasmid sequences from our analysis and identified only the repeats that have multiple copies on chromosomes (no repetitive sequences were searched from species plasmid sequences).As a first step, we analyzed the frequencies and lengths of all types of repeats in prokaryotic genomes. In the following analysis, we show the characteristic features of the species-specific repeats.3.2. Characterization of repeatsIn total, 613 microbial species comprising 876 different strains were analyzed. Repetitive DNA was detected in almost all species, with three exceptions: Buchnera aphidicola (six sequenced strains; NC_002528, NC_004061, NC_004545, NC_008513, NC_011833, and NC_011834), Candidatus Carsonella ruddii (NC_008512), and Candidatus Hodgkinia cicadicola (NC_012960). All these bacteria are symbionts with extremely small genomes.The number of different repeats per genome was highly variable (Fig. 1), ranging from 1 to 690 with the median 32 repeats per species. 95% of species contained fewer than 149 repeats. The highest number of repeats was found in the genome of the myxobacterium S. cellulosum' So ce 56', which also has the largest size (13 Mb) of all the analyzed genomes. The number of repetitive sequences per species. Most of the species contain fewer than 50 repeats.The number of repetitive sequences per species. Most of the species contain fewer than 50 repeats.The median value of the repeat coverage was 1.8% of the bacterial genome. In only 12 bacterial species, repetitive sequences made up 7% of the total size of their genome (Fig. 2). Most of these bacteria are pathogens (insect pathogen Wolbachia sp. wRi NC_012416, plant pathogens Phytoplasma mali NC_011047 and Hamiltonella defensa NC_012751, fish pathogen Aliivibrio salmonicida NC_011312 and NC_011313, and mammalian pathogens Mycoplasma mycoides NC_005364 and NC_015431, Bartonella tribocorum NC_010161, Anaplasma phagocytophilum NC_007797, Bartonella grahamii NC_012846, and Bartonella henselae NC_005956). In general, larger genomes tend to contain larger number of repeats and also a higher fraction of repetitive sequences from the genome sequence. The repeat coverage in bacterial genomes. In 95% of the species, the fraction of all repeats from the length of the genome is lower than 6%.The repeat coverage in bacterial genomes. In 95% of the species, the fraction of all repeats from the length of the genome is lower than 6%.The fraction of pathogens among species with elevated percentages of repetitive sequences [9 of 12 species (75%) are pathogenic] is somewhat higher than one would expect. The fraction of pathogenic species among all analyzed genomes (all that are known to be pathogenic or non-pathogenic) is 37.7%. We suggest that pathogenic bacteria have a pressure to adapt to the environment more quickly and repetitive sequences may aid this or, alternatively, be the result of this. In many pathogenic bacteria, a fraction of repetitive sequences are associated with pathogenicity genes. For example, repetitive sequences in A. phagocytophilum (~9% of the genome comprises repeats) contain genes functionally involved with the type IV secretion system. Also, repetitive sequences in B. tribocorum and B. henselae (~11 and ~7% of the genomes are repeats, respectively) contain several genes associated with pathogenicity—the Trw-conjugation system, filamentous hemagglutinin, specific adhesions, and components of the type IV secretion system. As many pathogenic processes remain uncharacterized, the fraction of genes involved in pathogenesis may be larger than we could interpret. An example of a non-pathogenic genome containing a high fraction of repeats is Dehalococcoides ethenogenes. It contains large duplications that include genes involved in the ability of dechlorinate groundwater pollutants. Supplementary Table S1 gives an overview of the numbers of identified repetitive sequences from all analyzed prokaryotic species.From a total of 33 921 different repeats found in this work, 29 771 (88%) were species-specific (Fig. 3). The total number of universal repeats (those that are present in two or more different genera) found in this work was 554; approximately half of them were present in only two species. After analysis of the universal repeats, we estimated that only 0.25% (84 repeats) of all repeats were truly universal, present in more than six species. Measured in nucleotides, species-specific repeats constituted more than half of the total length of all repetitive sequences. Perhaps more informative is the number of nucleotides included in either universal or species-specific repeats. In Fig. 3 (second set of three columns), one can see that species-specific repeats constitute ca. 58% of the total nucleotides included in all repeats. In all analyzed genomes, there are three times more nucleotides in species-specific repeats than in universal repeats (from Fig. 3, 58% divided to 19%). The frequencies of repeats considered in this study. The first three columns represent the percentage of the number of particular repeats from the total number of repeats found in this work. The second three columns show the percentage of repeats in nucleotides from the total length of repeats found in this work. This figure can be viewed in colour online.The frequencies of repeats considered in this study. The first three columns represent the percentage of the number of particular repeats from the total number of repeats found in this work. The second three columns show the percentage of repeats in nucleotides from the total length of repeats found in this work. This figure can be viewed in colour online.Of the analyzed species, 97% contained at least one species-specific repeat. Species-specific repetitive DNA was not detected in 20 of 613 species (listed in Supplementary Table S1). There are several possible explanations as to why we were not able to detect species-specific repeats in these 20 species. For example, B. aphidicola (six sequenced strains in our data set) is very widely defined and contains many variable genomic sequences, not sharing sufficient similarity over their repeats. Two species (Candidatus Carsonella ruddii and Candidatus Hodgkinia cicadicola) contain no repeats at all, probably because of their small genomes. In the other species (e.g. Brucella ovis, Brucella canis, and Brucella abortus), the existence of closely related fully sequenced species makes it impossible to find truly species-specific repeats.In Fig. 4, the length distribution for species-specific repeats is shown. We found that 95% of species-specific repeats were shorter than 1000 bp. Universal repeats had a similar repeat length distribution. The length distribution of species-specific and universal repeats. Only repeats shorter than 2000 nucleotides are shown (which constitute ~98% of all species-specific and ~98% of all universal repeats).

Light blue triangles represent species-specific repeats and dark blue squares represent universal repeats. y-axis represents the fraction of repeats of specific length to the total number of the repeats.Although most repeats are very short, many long species-specific repeats also exist in prokaryotic genomes. The longest species-specific repeat (36 kb) belongs to Alkaliphilus metalliredigens (NC_009633), which has a genome size of 4.9 Mb. The repeat has three copies overlapping 178 gene sequences with different RefSeq gene functions, mostly annotated as hypothetical proteins. Part of this repeat (23 kb of 36 kb) contains a prophage sequence identified by the computer software Phage_finder.25 The remaining sequences of this repeat may also have a phage origin as the genes present in this region are associated with regulation and initiation of transcription, cell wall component breakdown, and regeneration.As the copy number of a species-specific repeat might differ between different strains of the same species, the median value of copies of particular repeat in the analyzed strains of particular species was used as the copy number of a given repeat. Similarly, the median copy number of particular repeat in different species was used as a copy number of a universal repeat.Approximately 77% of species-specific repeats had two copies per repeat (Fig. 5). Only a small fraction had a large number of copies per repeat. For example, only 0.4% of species-specific repeats had more than 20 copies per repeat. The maximum number of copies of a species-specific repeat was identified in the marine bacterium Hahella chejuensis KCTC 2396 (NC_007645, genome length 7.2 Mb) with 111 copies. The median length of the copies of this repeat was 141 bp. The copies are dispersed over the genome and the origin of this sequence is unclear. The fact that several copies overlap by a few nucleotides at the 5' ends of different genes indicates that the repeat may play a role in the regulation of transcription. An overview of the copy numbers for all identified repeats is shown in Supplementary Table S2. The distribution of the number of copies per species-specific repeat. Although the number of copies per species-specific repeat in different species varies, the median value (rounded down to the nearest integer) over the number of copies per particular repeat is considered. The number above the column shows the percentage of prevalence of particular number of copies per repeat from the total number of repeats. Only the values over 1% are shown. y-axis is on a logarithmic scale.The distribution of the number of copies per species-specific repeat.

Only the values over 1% are shown. y-axis is on a logarithmic scale.In general, shorter repeats tend to have more copies (Fig. 6). However, Fig. 6 also shows somewhat higher copy numbers for species-specific repeats with lengths between 1000 and 2000 bp. This is due to species-specific transposons that contribute to the higher copy numbers in the length range between 900 and 1900 nucleotides.

Interestingly, species-specific repeats were much more frequently located in tandem than universal repeats, ~2% of which were located in tandem.3.3. Functional analysis of species-specific repeatsWe analyzed 29 771 species-specific repeats in order to understand the possible functions of repetitive sequences. We were interested in the general functional categories encoded within species-specific and universal repeats.Here, we have used the following classification of bacterial repetitive elements: (I) mobile genetic elements such as insertion sequences (ISs), transposons, phage sequences, and plasmid sequences; (II) RNA genes; (III) protein-coding genes; (IV) non-coding short interspersed repeats (ERIC/IRU, CRISPR, intergenic regions). All these repeat classes were represented among the species-specific repeats (Fig. 7). The protein-coding genes (class III) were the most abundant class (64% of all repeats). Mobile genetic elements (class I) and non-coding short interspersed repeats (class IV) both constituted 13–14% of all species-specific repeats. The smallest class (class II) of repeats included tRNA and rRNA genes. Approximately 6% of species-specific repeats could not be classified with our methodology. Different classes of species-specific repeats. (A) Repeat frequencies of species-specific repeats. (B) Repeat coverage of species-specific repeats. As ERIC/IRU sequences constitute under 0.03% of all species-specific repeats, they are not shown.Different classes of species-specific repeats. (A) Repeat frequencies of species-specific repeats. (B) Repeat coverage of species-specific repeats. As ERIC/IRU sequences constitute under 0.03% of all species-specific repeats, they are not shown.For comparison, the universal repeats (Supplementary Fig. S1) contained mainly mobilome elements (class I), some long regions of universally repeated rRNA genes (class II), and ~40% were protein-coding genes (class III).We identified that 19% of species-specific repeats belong to the class of non-coding short intergenic repeats and repeats with unknown origin. A fraction of these repeats may comprise a certain conserved regulatory elements. For example, IRUs and specific intergenic repeat motifs (CIR motifs, >100 bp) are supposedly associated with gene conversion or with regulatory or structural requirements of the bacterial genomes.31–33 In our data set, we found that more than half of the species (365 species) contain at least one species-specific repeat which is located prior to, following to, or between RNA gene sequences (e.g. between 23S rRNA and 5S rRNA gene sequences, between different tRNA sequences, etc). The overlap between the gene sequence and the repeat constitutes a small extent from repeat/gene sequence. Thus, in many cases, sequences between RNA genes may characterize a species uniquely. Still, many intergenic repeats have no associated function and are considered to be predominantly genomic parasites.34,35An overview of the most frequent functions of species-specific repeats associated with genes (class III) is shown in Table 1. A notable group of species-specific repeated genes contains membrane proteins, transport proteins, and repeat-containing proteins. High sequence variation of these genes between species may be related to the need to adapt to specific environments or the need of pathogenic microbes to vary their immunogenic properties. The largest group, 31% of all repeat-associated genes, is annotated as ‘hypothetical protein’ by NCBI RefSeq. We analyzed the regions of hypothetical proteins containing repeats against Pfam database and found Pfam entries for 28% (2372 repeats) of them. Over the half of the repetitive sequences searched for are found from automatically generated Pfam-B families (866 families) or from the curated Pfam-A collection (471 families) predicted as proteins of unknown function. The rest of the matches represent variable functions of proteins. For example, the highest number of matches (for 48 repeats) was gained from the tetratricopeptide repeat superfamily, which are found from numerous and diverse proteins involved in such functions as cell cycle regulation, transcriptional control, mitochondrial and peroxisomal protein transport, neurogenesis, and protein folding. Classification of genes containing species-specific repeatsThe number shows how many repeats are overlapping the gene by at least 50% of the length of a given repeat. The total number of repeats overlapping gene sequences is 18 961, of which 15 742 repeats are shown in this table.Classification of genes containing species-specific repeatsThe number shows how many repeats are overlapping the gene by at least 50% of the length of a given repeat. The total number of repeats overlapping gene sequences is 18 961, of which 15 742 repeats are shown in this table.We analyzed repeats that contain full-length protein-coding gene sequences that are represented in at least two copies of a particular repeat. We found that 1034 repetitive sequences contain full-length species-specific protein-coding genes in at least two copies of that repeat, resulting in 4001 different genes in total. Most of these genes (56.7 versus the 30.6% expected on the basis of RefSeq annotations of prokaryotic protein-coding genes) are hypothetical proteins (statistically over-represented P < 0.0001).However, several interesting details emerged. For example, we found that pseudogenes are statistically significantly over-represented (P < 0.0001). The RefSeq annotations of prokaryotic protein-coding genes imply that on average ~1.68% of randomly chosen protein-coding genes are pseudogenes. In contrast, we found that 6.0% of the analyzed genes are pseudogenes. We suggest that this can be explained by gene duplication. It is known that gene duplication is a significant contributor to the evolution of genomes. In some cases, one duplicated copy may become non-functionalized by randomly accumulating degenerative mutations in the absence of selective advantage.36 Another notable group of genes, encoding transport proteins, is under-represented (P < 0.0001) among the analyzed genes (12.6 and 5.8% are the percentages of expected and observed transport proteins, respectively). It is shown that at least some transport proteins are conserved among a wide range of species.37,38 This is also supported by our analysis of universal repeats where transport proteins are over-represented.Hamiltonella defensa (NC_012751) is an endosymbiont found in sap-feeding insects, including aphids, psyllids, and whiteflies. Hamiltonella defensa is an example of species containing relatively various repeat classes, whereas many species contain only one or two different classes of repeats.The complete list of species-specific repeats in H. defensa contains 95 repeats (plus three universal repeats that contain rRNA and/or tRNA sequences and four repeats that were present in other species but not as repeats). In total, 55 species-specific repetitive sequences are classified as mobile genetic elements; 4 are classified as ISs; 34 are classified as phage-related sequences; and 17 are classified as plasmidic repeats.The remaining 40 species-specific repeats are associated with protein-coding genes. Sixteen of them are related to proteins of the RTX family, which contains putative virulence factors, RTX toxins (repeats in toxins), which are exported proteins.39 This could explain why there are 10 species-specific repeats associated with different inner and outer membrane proteins, some of which are suggested to be auto-transporters. Also, one repeat contains genes of which the functions involve different type IV pilus biosynthesis proteins (type IV pilus proteins are also essential for virulence).Furthermore, only two repeats contain hypothetical protein-coding genes and only four species-specific repeats contain pseudogenes.The final six repetitive sequences are associated with genes with various functions (methionine sulfoxide reductase, phosphomannomutase, heat shock protein, amidase and lipoprotein, serine endoprotease, transcriptional regulator, and GTP cyclohydrolase). Some of these genes could also be involved with pathogenicity but no direct reference can be indicated.3.4. Firmness of species-specific repeatsOne of the major questions that arose during this work was related to the definition of species and the genetic variation within species. Does a species-specific repeat exist as a repeat in every newly sequenced strain? Or, if a new, closely related species is sequenced, does the repeat remain species-specific? In reality, of all the prokaryotic genomes existing on the Earth, only a small part of each has been sequenced; this part may represent distantly related genomes. Because of these questions, we have validated species-specific repeats against a prokaryotic database that consists of ~1.42 times more species than the database used for finding those repeats (data not shown). Approximately 88% of detected species-specific repeats remained species-specific in this larger data set. Interestingly, closest species where the species-specific repeats could still be found are 99% identical in terms of 16S rRNA (e.g. Shewanella pealeana NC_009901 and Shewanella halifaxensis NC_010334). Nevertheless, some repeats turned out to be non-species-specific in the larger data set, because they existed in another newly sequenced species or the repeat was not present in the genome of a newly sequenced strain of the same species. This raises the question of whether the species-specific repeats we have identified are real species-specific repeats or just data analysis artifacts, dependent on the number of available genomes and the choice of species for analysis.The possibility of finding, or not finding, a species-specific repeat is partly determined by the controversial definition of bacterial species. Currently, the definition comprises 70% DNA–DNA re-association as a standard.40 As this definition is somewhat arbitrary, the definition of species-specific repeats is also arbitrary. However, the problem of the species concept is not the topic of this article. We use the definition of species as it comes from the NCBI genome database, together with the genomic DNA sequence. In most cases, the repeats we define as species-specific repeats will remain specific to a group of phylogenetically related strains, even if the concept of the species will be changed in future. Yet, we have identified strain-specific repetitive sequences (data not shown) in 50 of 91 species for which 2–26 completely sequenced strains per species were available. Strain-specific repetitive sequences add some confidence to the existence of repeats specific to a small phylogenetically related group.4. DiscussionAlthough repetitive sequences are less common in prokaryotes than in eukaryotes, almost all prokaryotic species still have some identifiable repeats. In this work, we have characterized mainly the species-specific repetitive sequences—repeats common to all strains of a species, but not to other species.In accordance with widely accepted understanding that prokaryotic genomes are compactly organized, we have demonstrated that the median value of the repeat coverage of bacterial genome is 1.8% (species-specific repeats constitute ~1% from this). Despite of a small fraction of repetitive sequences in prokaryotic genomes, many novel findings have arisen. We have found that not all repetitive sequences in prokaryotic genomes belong to mobile genetic elements. Our results indicate that only ~14% of the species-specific repetitive sequences and ~53% of universal repeats are associated with mobile genetic elements. Further, the functions of many intergenic repeats and repeats from the class of unknown origin (in total ~17% from the species-specific repeats) are not understood. However, a fraction of intergenic repeats may comprise a certain conserved regulatory elements. For example, specific intergenic repeats (CIR motifs, >100 bp) in Caulobacter crescentus may be associated with gene conversion and with gene regulation.33 A large number of various functions of protein-coding genes, reflecting the diversity of sequenced prokaryotic genomes, have emerged from the functional analysis. In different species, genes associated with repeats have variable roles and no common phenomenon can be identified for all species or for groups of particular species. As shown, the function of many protein-coding genes associated with species-specific repeats remains unknown. We rather think that this interesting question cannot be answered by automatic analysis but must be left to biologists who investigate a particular genome in more detail. The functional analysis also revealed that different repeat classes appear in different species. In some species, phage-related sequences are in prevalence; in the other, only rDNA-related repeats appear; or in the third, one large duplication containing different protein-coding genes is found. Every species seems to be somewhat unique regarding to its repeats.One important application of species-specific repeats is their usage in the identification of prokaryotic species. The repetitive sequences increase the sensitivity of the PCR test simply because of the higher concentration (double or more) of the initial sequence.24 In this work, we have shown that many of the species-specific repetitive sequences are associated with protein-coding genes, so at least these repeats can be reliably used as target sequences in PCR tests. Species-specific or a group of phylogenetically related strains-specific repeats may sometimes not be the preferred target in medical diagnostics. This is in cases where pathogenic genes are known and the objective of the diagnostic test is to detect such a gene rather than to detect the species.41 However, we believe that this does not diminish the value of species-specific repeats as a PCR target region for the detection of species. Pathogenic gene-specific PCR primers can be designed with similar methodology and used in addition to species-specific PCR primers in medical tests.In conclusion, the current work enhances knowledge about prokaryotic species-specific repeats in many novel aspects. Most prokaryotic species contain several short species-specific repeats, which are represented in the genome with a low copy number. In a typical prokaryotic species, the species-specific repeats cover ~1% of the genome. Over half of these repeats contain protein-coding genes, approximately one-eighth are associated with mobile genetic elements and one-eighth are associated with short non-coding interspersed elements. Thus, most of the species-specific repeats are associated with protein-coding genes and probably related to the biochemical processes required for adaptation and survival of any given prokaryote. Unfortunately, the functions of many species-specific repeats related to protein-coding genes currently remain unexplained.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournal.org.FundingThis work was funded by the EU European Regional Development Fund, through the Estonian Centre of Excellence in Genomics and grant SF0180026s09 from the Estonian Ministry of Education and Research.Supplementary data"

IntroductionThe hemiascomycetous yeast Yarrowia lipolytica has relatively few introns compared with other Opisthokonts such as vertebrates or even compared with basidiomycota and filamentous ascomycota. However, with introns in ~15% of its genes,1Y. lipolytica has many more introns than any other hemiascomycete yeast, e.g. four times more than Saccharomyces cerevisiae.2 Despite this paucity of introns, the S. cerevisiae transcriptome is proving to be more complex than previously appreciated.3,4 Alternative transcription start sites have been reported and, for some intron-containing genes, transcript variants result from either alternative splicing (AS) or intron retention. Overall, alternative transcripts leading to different proteins remain uncommon in S. cerevisiae and only one case of AS (SRC15) and one of intron retention (PTC76) have been described, along with several cases of alternative start sites (e.g. YCAT7 and SUC28). The large majority of alternative transcripts in yeasts are presumed to be untranslated, as most of them contain premature termination codons and therefore activate the nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway that degrades defective mRNAs prior to translation (for review, see Behm-Ansmant et al.9 and Stalder and Muhlemann10).AS has been investigated at the genome scale in Y. lipolytica and all known modes of AS have been observed, i.e. exon skipping and alternative 5'- or 3'-splice sites, as well as intron retention and alternative start sites.1 Several of these genes are involved in central carbon metabolism. The malate dehydrogenase (MDH) gene (YlMDH2, YALI0E14190g) was particularly attractive, as AS does not generate a premature termination codon, but leads to putative functional variants of the protein.The MDH isoenzymes catalyse the conversion of malate into oxaloacetate with a concomitant reduction of NAD+ (see Minarik et al.11 for a review). This reaction, which is reversible, represents an important step in the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, a central metabolic pathway occurring in mitochondria and critical for cellular respiration and ATP production.12,13 The reaction also takes place in the glyoxylate cycle, which is a variant of the TCA cycle that shares three of its five enzymes with the TCA cycle, including MDH. In plants, nematodes and yeasts, the glyoxylate cycle is partly localized in peroxisomes, and thus contributes to the degradation of free fatty acids by providing coenzyme A and/or reoxidizing NADH for the ß-oxidation cycle. MDH is also involved in gluconeogenesis, which takes place in the cytosol and plays a significant role in the malate/aspartate shuttle across the mitochondrial membrane.In S. cerevisiae, three MDH genes (MDH1, MDH2 and MDH3) have been identified and each encodes an enzyme targeted for a different subcellular compartment. Mdh1p is localized in mitochondria,14,15 Mdh2p in the cytosol16,17 and Mdh3p in peroxisomes.18,19 Large sequence variations have been observed in the MDH regions that encode the putative domains involved in compartmental targeting. For example, MDH1 encodes a 17-amino acid N-terminal extension that is absent from the other isozymes and is removed upon mitochondrial import.15 Mdh3p has a unique C-terminal tripeptide sequence, Ser-Lys-Leu, characteristic of peroxisomal targeting sequences (PTSs).20 This targeting sequence, called PTS1, is conserved in S. cerevisiae, but other conservative variants, such as Ala-Lys-Ile, exist among yeasts.21–23Homologues of all three S. cerevisiae MDH genes are present in many other hemiascomycetous species.24 In contrast, the oleagineous yeast Y. lipolytica contains only two MDH genes: YALI0D16753g (YlMDH1) and YALI0E14190g (YlMDH2). Whereas the first gene encodes a protein predicted to have a mitochondrial location, the second gene encodes a putatively cytosolic form. The presence of only two MDH genes in Y. lipolytica compared with the three genes possessed by other hemiascomycetes, and the fact that YlMDH2 is potentially subject to AS,1 suggest a possible role for AS in the regulation of MDH compartmentalization in this yeast. We thus focused on these Y. lipolytica MDH genes to decipher the roles and regulation of the different isoenzymes. In this study, we show that YlMDH2 encodes the cytosolic and peroxisomal forms of MDH. This dual localization is due to the presence of an alternative 3'-splice site in the second intron of the gene, located at the 3'-end of the coding sequence. The use of this alternative splice site creates an mRNA that encodes a carboxyl-terminal peroxisomal targeting sequence (PTS1) and allows specific peroxisomal localization, which was revealed by colocalization studies.2. Materials and methods2.1. Strains and culture conditionsThe yeast and bacterial strains used in this study are listed in Table 1. The bacterial strains, Mach1 T1® (Invitrogen, Cergy Pontoise, France) and DH5a (Gibco BRL, Rockville, MD, USA) used for the amplification of recombinant plasmids, were grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani medium supplemented with 100 µg/l ampicillin or 40 µg/l kanamycin, if required. Yarrowia lipolytica and bacterial strains used in this studyYarrowia lipolytica and bacterial strains used in this studyGrowth media and conditions used for Y. lipolytica have been previously described.25 The yeasts were grown on rich medium YPD and minimum medium YNB26 or YNBE (YNB supplemented with 0.1% yeast extract), supplemented with 0.2% (w/v) casa-amino acids or 0.05 g/ml uracil, if required. Carbon sources were dextrose (D), oleic acid (OA), tributyrin (TB), triolein (TO), alkane (hexadecane), acetate (ammonium or sodium), glycerol or ethanol at a final concentration of 2%. The hydrophobic substrates were emulsified by sonication in a mixture containing 20% OA, TB or TO and 0.625% (v/v) Tween 40. For solid media, 2% agar was added. Yeast strains were grown at 28°C. Growth on 96-well plates in 100 µl was performed under constant agitation with glucose, malate, succinate or citrate at 0.5% as the carbon source. Growth was monitored by measuring the optical density at 600 nm every 10 min using a microtiter plate reader (Biotek, Colmar, France). For each strain and condition, four biological replicates were performed. Calculations of average OD, blank reduction, the lag phase (µ) and the maximum OD were performed using the grofit package in R.27 Differences between growth curves were evaluated by analysis of variance with R statistical software.282.2. Molecular biology techniquesStandard molecular biology techniques were used throughout this study.29 Restriction enzymes were obtained from Ozyme (Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines, France). Genomic DNA from yeast was prepared as previously reported.30 Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplifications were performed using an Eppendorf 2720 thermocycler, Pyrobest DNA polymerase (Lonza, Levallois-Perret, France) and the primers are listed in Table 2. PCR fragments were purified using the QIAquick PCR Puri<U+FB01>cation Kit (Qiagen, Courtaboeuf, France). DNA fragments were recovered from agarose gels using the QIAquick Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen).

Stop codons and methionine codons (or the first nucleotide of the codon) are in bold. Nucleotides complementary to the S-K-L codons are in bold italic. Intron nucleotide sequence is in lower case.2.3. Genetic modificationsThree constructions were made to determine the phenotypes of the strains containing deletions of either the short or long introns of YlMDH2. The primers used for PCR amplification are listed in Table 2. The forward primer contained a ClaI restriction site and stop codons in the three phases. The reverse primers contained an AvrII site and sequences corresponding to the wild-type gene and to the two variants. The corresponding ClaI-AvrII PCR fragments were cloned into the JMP62 URA3ex vector31 previously digested with ClaI-AvrII. The resulting plasmids were purified, digested with BamHI (a BamHI site is present in the middle of the gene), and used to transform the PO1d strain by the lithium acetate method.32 After single crossing-over, the mutated version had integrated at the YlMDH2 locus under its own promoter and the genomic version was invalidated by the introduction of stop codons at the 5'-end of the wild-type gene (Supplementary Fig. S1). The resulting strains JMY1699, JMY1707 and JMY1711 (Table 1) expressed the predicted cytosolic, peroxisomal and wild-type versions of the YlMDH2 gene products and were confirmed by southern blot (data not shown). Prototrophic strains were obtained by transforming the different mutants with the LEU2 marker, which gave rise to the strains JMY2416, JMY2426 and JMY2428, respectively (Table 1).We monitored localization of the MDH proteins in different subcellular compartments by expressing recombinant genes that encoded the peroxisomal or cytosolic mutant or the wild-type protein fused to the eYFP fluorescent protein tag at their N-termini. The three variant constructs were PCR amplified as BclI-AvrII fragments using specific primers (Table 2) and then cloned into the JMP62 URA3ex-YFP-N vector previously digested by BamHI and AvrII. This vector was derived from the JMP62 URA3ex vector31 and allows N-terminal, eYFP-tagged proteins to be produced under control of the POX2 promoter. The three different expression cassettes were excised from their respective vectors by NotI digestion, gel purified, and subsequently used to transform PO1d to create the JMY2451, JMY2457 and JMY2459 strains, respectively (Table 1). These strains were subsequently transformed with constructions containing the sequence of the fluorescent protein RedStar2. The RedStar2 gene was PCR amplified from the plasmid pYM4333 using primers containing BamHI and AvrII restriction sites (Table 2) and cloned into the JMP62 LEU2ex pTEF vector previously digested by BamHI and AvrII. The JMP62 LEU2ex pTEF plasmid corresponds to JMP62 LEU2ex in which the pPOX2 promoter has been exchanged with the pTEF promoter.34 Primers were designed to add or not add a PTS1 consensus sequence (Ser-Lys-Leu; SKL) onto the C-terminus of RedStar2 and allow expression of cytosolic or peroxisome-targeted RedStar2 protein. Each RedStar2 expression cassette was released by NotI digestion, gel purified, and subsequently used to transform the JMY2451, JMY2457 and JMY2459 strains. The resulting strains harboured one of the three different eYFP-tagged MDH protein expression constructs controlled by the POX2 promoter and an addition construct for expressing either the RedStar2 or the RedStar2-SKL protein under control of pTEF. All the strains generated are listed in Table 1.2.4. MicroscopyImages were acquired using a Zeiss Axio Imager.M2 microscope (Zeiss, Le Pecq, France) using a 100× objective and Zeiss filters 45 and 46 for fluorescent microscopy. Image acquisition was performed with the Axiovision 4.8 software (Zeiss). All images were post-processed similarly (background reduction) and merged using ImageJ software (http://rsbweb.nih.gov/ij/). Strains were grown 12h on YNBE 2% OA, YNBE 2% D or YNBE with both 1% D and 2% OA.2.5. RNA-seq analysis of YlMDH2 transcriptsRNA-seq data produced in the lab were screened for the different splicing variants of YlMDH2. Total RNAs from cells cultivated in six different conditions (glucose, OA, TO, TB, alkane, and glycerol) were prepared using the Qiagen RNeasy kit (Qiagen). mRNAs were purified by the selection of poly(A)+ transcripts, which were then sequenced by the Illumina Solexa sequencing technology with either a Genome Analyzer IIX or a HiSeq sequencing system. Thirteen to 29 million single-end reads were generated per sample with a read length of 36 nt, 50 nt or 100 nt (accession numbers E-MTAB-939 and E-MTAB-940). The reads were aligned to both forms of YlMDH2 spliced transcripts (long or short intron) using SOAPaligner version 2.20.35 Only reads aligned to the exon–exon junction (34 nt, 48 nt or 98 nt from each exon, depending on the read length) of intron 2 were counted and the ratio between the two isoforms was determined. We used Fisher's exact tests to determine whether the expression levels of YlMDH2 differed in the different growth conditions and to determine the significance of the differences observed among the AS ratios.2.6. BioinformaticsHomologues of S. cerevisiae MDH were identified in fully sequenced Y. lipolytica genomes from Génolevures (http://www.genolevures.org/) using BLASTp.36 Homologues were also found in Pichia pastoris (Pichia_GS115.pep_0509; https://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/gdb/pichia/) and in Schizosaccharomyces pombe (pompep_17022010; http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Projects/S_pombe/). Amino acids sequences were then aligned using MUSCLE37 or Multalin38 and columns of gap-containing residues were removed manually. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with the Neighbour-Joining algorithm using ClustalX.39Predictions for mitochondrial protein targeting were performed using MITOPROT II version 1.101 (http://ihg.gsf.de/ihg/mitoprot.html).40 PTS1 targeting sequence predictions were performed using the PTS1 predictor using default cut-off (http://mendel.imp.ac.at/mendeljsp/sat/pts1/PTS1predictor.jsp).413. Results3.1. Malate dehydrogenase protein families in hemiascomycetous yeastsIn S. cerevisiae, the three genes that encode MDH are: YKL085W (MDH1), which encodes the mitochondrial enzyme;14,15 YOL126C (MDH2), which encodes the cytosolic enzyme;16,17 and YDL378C (MDH3), which encodes the peroxisomal enzyme.18,19 The three isozymes show amino acid identities ranging from 43 to 50%.19 A Blast search for S. cerevisiae MDH homologues in the Y. lipolytica genome42 identified only two genes, YALI0D16753g (YlMDH1) and YALI0E14190g (YlMDH2). Both genes exhibit the highest levels of amino acid conservation with the S. cerevisiae MDH1 gene, with 63% identity and 79% similarity for YALI0D16753g and 47% identity and 62% similarity for YlMDH2. The computed proteome families of the Génolevures database24 revealed that both Y. lipolytica MDH genes belong to the GL3R0092 family, which includes all of the MDH proteins encoded by the nine fully sequenced yeast genomes in the Génolevures database. All of these genomes contain three MDH genes. The only exceptions are Y. lipolytica (two genes) and Lachancea (Kluyveromyces) thermotolerans, which possesses three additional genes. We found these additional genes (KLTH0D00440g, KLTH0G19536g and KLTH0G19558g) to be closely related to each other (64–66% identity and 80–83% similarity) but very divergent from all other hemiascomycetous MDH genes. Due to their mutual similarity and their localization (one is subtelomeric and two are repeated in tandem), they likely represent species-specific gene duplications. Given their divergence from the other hemiascomycete proteins, we did not consider them in our phylogenetic analysis. As Y. lipolytica is relatively isolated among the hemiascomycetes from a phylogenetic point of view, we added two other yeasts, not included in the previous yeast set, more closely related to Y. lipolytica: Arxula adeninivorans (recently sequenced and annotated by the Génolevures consortium, to be published) and P. pastoris.43 Like Y. lipolytica, these two species contain only two MDH genes. We used these data to construct a phylogenetic tree of MDHs in the hemiascomycetous yeasts with the unique MDH gene from S. pombe as the outgroup (Fig. 1A). Simultaneously, we performed in silico sequence analysis to predict mitochondrial and peroxisomal localization for the different genes using MITOPROT and PTS1 prediction online software (Fig. 1B). The phylogenetic tree highlights clear distinctions between the three types of MDH. The most conserved branch corresponds to the mitochondrial MDH, with high levels of amino acid conservation among the different proteins: 61–85% identity and 76–92% similarity (Fig. 1A). The peroxisomal branch is less conserved, with minimums of 34% identity and 44% similarity for the most distantly related proteins. The cytosolic MDHs segregated into two branches, with similarity and identity values close to those obtained for the peroxisomal branch (35–62% identity and 45–77% similarity). According to the localization predictions, only one gene, DEHA2F09020g from Debaryomyces hansenii, which has a PTS1 peroxisome targeting sequence (C-terminal sequence SKL and PTS1 predictor score of -8.044), is mislocalized in the cytosolic branch (Fig. 1). Eremothecium (Ashbya) gossypii has three MDH genes, but the localization prediction failed to identify any PTS1 sequence in these three genes. The ERGO0D15114g protein belonging to the peroxisomal branch harbours an unexpectedly long C-terminal extension of ~150 amino acids. In a recently corrected version of the Ashbya Genome Database (http://agd.vital-it.ch/index.html44; version 11 of 26 May 2011), the gene AGOS_ADR252W encodes a protein of 339 amino acids (vs 486 aa in ERGO0D15114p) and has a putative PTS1 with a significant score (C-terminal sequence ARL and PTS1 predictor score 3.865).

(B) In silico predictions of protein targeting. The MITOPROT score, PTS1 predictor score and C-terminal sequence are indicated for each MDH.The product of the Y. lipolytica YlMDH1 gene is predicted to be targeted to the mitochondria (MITOPROT probability 0.9891), whereas the product of the YlMDH2 gene is not (MITOPROT probability 0.3528). Neither of these genes harbours any PTSs. This is in line with their positions in the phylogenetic tree, i.e. YlMDH1 is positioned within the mitochondrial branch, and YlMDH2 is within the cytosolic branch of the tree. Similarly, A. adeninivorans and P. pastoris both have a mitochondrial form (ARAD1B14036g and Pipas_chr2-1_0238, respectively) and a cytosolic form (ARAD1D04884g and Pipas_chr4_0815, respectively) according to phylogeny and signal sequence prediction. Consequently, for these three closely related species, sequence analysis of their complete genomes did not identify any peroxisomal forms of MDH.3.2. The YlMDH2 gene is alternatively splicedThe peroxisomal form of MDH has been reported to be mandatory for fatty acid degradation in S. cerevisiae.45Yarrowia lipolytica is an oleagineous yeast, with an affinity for fatty acids as a carbon source. Thus, the absence of a peroxisomal form of MDH was unlikely. A deeper analysis of the sequence of YlMDH2 revealed a putative alternative 3'-splice site for the second intron, defined by comparison with the splicing sequence pattern of the genosplicing database (http://genome.jouy.inra.fr/genosplicing2). The gene model of YlMDH2 is represented in Fig. 2A, with the positions of the putative intron boundaries (5'- and 3'-splice sites) and the branch point (BP) at the exon 2–intron 2–exon 3 junctions in Fig. 2B. The putative AS event leads to a very minor change in the length of the mRNA sequence (4 nt) but introduces a 3'-frameshift and thus generates different stop codons. If the intron is spliced at the upstream 3'-splice site (short intron), the amino acid sequence of the C-terminus encoded by the YlMDH2 mRNA is P-A-N. If splicing occurs at the downstream 3'-splice site (long intron), the C-terminal amino acid sequence ends with A-K-I (Fig. 2B), which is a characteristic PTS1 sequence identified in several yeasts.21,23Gene model for YlMDH2.

Exon parts are represented by grey rectangles and the two putative C-terminal protein sequences are indicated.We generated three cDNA libraries from Y. lipolytica cells cultivated in media containing either glucose (exponential and stationary phases) or oleate (exponential phase) as the carbon source1 and obtained 30 cDNA clones corresponding to YlMDH2 transcripts. All of these clones derived from cells harvested from glucose medium: 10 clones from cells harvested in the exponential phase (expo library) and 20 clones from cells harvested in the stationary phase (stat library). We sequenced the 3'-ends of 11 of these YlMDH2 cDNA clones and found that seven corresponded to mRNAs spliced at the upstream 3'-splice site (short intron 2 splice) and four corresponded to mRNAs spliced at the downstream 3'-splice site (long intron 2). As expected from our model, the two groups of cDNAs differed by only four nucleotides (Fig. 2B) and thus validated AS for YlMDH2. The different numbers of cDNAs for the two spliced forms (five cDNAs with a short intron and two cDNAs with a long intron in the expo library, and only four cDNAs with a long intron, none with a short intron, in the expo library) was a first indication that the AS was regulated by the environment of the cells, i.e. the growth conditions. However, due to the low number of cDNAs sequenced, the statistical significance of this difference could not be confirmed. This prompted us to investigate larger data sets using RNA-seq experiments.In a first experiment (Illumina Solexa with single reads of 36 bp; Table 3) involving six different growth conditions, we retrieved a total of 1829 RNA-seq reads containing the exon–exon junction of the second intron of YlMDH2: 1181 reads corresponded to the short intron variant, and 648 reads corresponded to the long intron variant. The short intron/long intron usage ratio varied from 0.9 to 5.05 according to the carbon source used for growth (Table 3). These results strongly suggest that environmental conditions influence the regulation of YlMDH2 AS. For example, for Y. lipolytica grown on TB medium, the number of transcripts containing the upstream 3'-splice site is five times the number of transcripts containing the downstream 3'-splice site. This ratio is significantly different from those found in all other conditions (P < 0.0001, for all comparisons to TB). In contrast, the levels of both variants were equivalent in cells grown on alkane. Additional RNA-seq experiments with two replicates on glucose (HiSeq with single reads of 50 bp; Table 3) and OA (HiSeq with paired-end reads of 2 × 100 bp) media confirmed that both ratios are conserved. However, these promising results on splicing regulation are presented as preliminary results since they came from a single time point, with a single concentration of carbon source and using RNA-seq as a single method of quantification. They obviously should be confirmed by additional experiments and alternative methods to understand the kinetic and the carbon source concentration-dependent regulations. This will be further investigated and will constitute the aim of a separate study.

Absence of either the peroxisomal or the cytosolic form of the MDH does not affect growth rate, irrespective of the carbon sourceIn order to evaluate the biological roles of the two MDH isoforms encoded by YlMDH2, we constructed strains that expressed cDNAs encoding either the cytosolic (cyto), peroxisomal (pero) or wild-type (wt) form of YlMdh2p at the YlMDH2 locus in the Y. lipolytica PO1d strain (JMY2416, JMY2426 and JMY2428 strains, respectively). After complementation to restore prototrophy, strains were screened for growth on various substrates known to affect the growth of S. cerevisiae MDH mutants, i.e. glucose, acetate, ethanol and OA.17–19,46,47 Surprisingly, we did not observe any growth rate differences among the three strains in either liquid or solid culture using these substrates as the sole carbon sources (see Fig. 3 for growth on solid substrates and Fig. 4A for glucose on liquid medium). We also screened these strains for growth on other lipid substrates, i.e. TB and TO, but failed to identify any specific growth phenotypes (Fig. 3). We also performed growth rate comparisons in a 96-well plate system using various carbon sources. Under these experimental conditions, we observed significant increases in the growth rate and maximum cell growth for the cyto strain (JMY2416) for all carbon sources tested, but observed no differences in the lag phase. For example, the P-values calculated for four replicates grown on glucose are 1.544e-2 and 1.184e-4 for the growth rate and maximum cell growth, respectively (Fig. 4B). We speculated that this result may be due to low oxygenation of the culture in a microtiter plate. In order to simulate low oxygen levels in a flask culture, we complemented the growth medium with antimycin A, a drug that impairs the respiratory chain, at a concentration that allows Y. lipolytica to grow but with a reduced rate (0.1 µg/ml). However, the growth rates of all strains were similarly reduced (data not shown), which indicated that the increased growth rate of the cyto strain is not directly linked to respiration efficiency. This phenomenon could be linked to oxygen access for other pathways or could reflect a different morphological state that affects optical density and may not rely on growth rate directly. Expression of alternatively spliced forms of YlMDH2 and growth on different substrates. Serial dilutions (serial dilution factor of five) of cultures of the wild-type (wt—JMY2428) strain, the cytosolic variant (cyto—JMY2416) and the peroxisomal variant (pero—JMY2426) were inoculated on YNB medium supplemented with different carbon sources. No growth differences between the mutants were detected; both of them were able to grow on all the media.Expression of alternatively spliced forms of YlMDH2 and growth on different substrates.

Malate dehydrogenase localizationIn order to locate the two MDH isoforms produced by AS, we constructed vectors to express the eYFP fluorescent protein fused to the N-termini of the cytosolic and peroxisomal MDH isoforms and to the N-terminus of MDH expressed from the wt YlMDH2 gene. Yarrowia lipolytica strains containing these constructs were subsequently transformed with a construction encoding the RedStar2 fluorescent protein without or with a PTS1 sequence (Ser-Lys-Leu; SKL) and used for colocalization studies. The native RedStar2 protein was cytosolic, whereas the RedStar2-SKL protein was targeted to the peroxisomes, which were visible as fluorescent dots in the cells (Fig. 5). In the strain expressing the predicted cytosolic form of eYFP-MDH, green fluorescence colocalized with red fluorescence produced by cytosolic RedStar2 (Fig. 5; JMY2499), but did not colocalize with the peroxisomal form of RedStar2 (Fig. 5; JMY2493). Conversely, the predicted peroxisomal form of eYFP-MDH colocalized with the peroxisomal form of RedStar2 (colocalization of fluorescent dots; Fig. 5; JMY2496) but not with cytosolic RedStar2 (Fig. 5; JMY2501). These colocalization experiments confirmed that the upstream splice variant mRNA encodes a cytosolic form of MDH, whereas the downstream splice variant encodes MDH with a C-terminal PTS1 and is peroxisomal. For all these constructions, we observed similar localizations and colocalizations with either glucose or OA as the carbon source. For the eYFP-tagged wild-type copy of YlMdh2p, which encoded both MDH isoforms, we observed clear cytosolic fluorescence (Fig. 5; JMY2500) but no clear labelling of peroxisomes (Fig. 5; JMY2495). However, overlapping fluorescence might have prevented distinguishing the peroxisomal and cytosolic localizations, especially since the expression level of the cytosolic isoform is higher than that of the peroxisomal form, as suggested by the cyto/pero RNA ratio (Table 3). Colocalization of the two YlMdh2p isoforms with cytosolic or peroxisomal forms of the RedStar2 protein. eYFP-tagged peroxisomal YlMdh2p (eYFP-MDHp), cytosolic YlMdh2p (eYFP-MDHc) or wild-type YlMdh2p (eYFP-MDHwt) were co-expressed with either the peroxisomal (redstar2p) or cytosolic (redstar2c) forms of the RedStar2 protein. For each strain, both proteins (MDH and RedStar2) were visualized simultaneously by fluorescence microscopy.

AS of MDH is unique to Y. lipolyticaA comparative study of the MDH gene family revealed that P. pastoris and A. adeninivorans also contain only two genes coding for MDH, and in each case, a peroxisomal form is absent. Whereas the P. pastoris MDH genes do not contain any introns, model predictions for the gene that encodes the cytosolic form of MDH in A. adeninivorans revealed the presence of two introns. The second intron is located at exactly the same position as the second intron of YlMDH2 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Unexpectedly, the terminal exon has undergone a large expansion, probably by fusion with a downstream CDS, which is conserved in synteny in Y. lipolytica. Despite the presence of the same positioned intron, no alternative 3'-splice site was detected in A. adeninivorans.4. DiscussionYarrowia lipolytica genes contain more introns than those of S. cerevisiae (15 and 4%, respectively) or other hemiascomycetes, and Y. lipolytica exhibits all known forms of AS.1,2 This suggests possible roles for splicing in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression and/or in generating additional proteome complexity in Y. lipolytica, and that splicing might have a much higher impact in Y. lipolytica than in S. cerevisiae. As an example of protein targeting regulation, we found clear evidence that the MDH gene YlMDH2 is alternatively spliced and leads to the production of two proteins destined for distinct cellular compartments: cytosol and peroxisomes. The HAC1 gene in Y. lipolytica48 is also subject to functional AS; however, this gene possesses a non-spliceosomal intron and the splicing mechanism is mediated under stress conditions by Ire1p, a transmembrane kinase/endonuclease.49 Thus, the YlMDH2 gene constitutes the first case of functional AS involving a spliceosomal intron in Y. lipolytica.Overall, few cases of AS have been described in hemiascomycete yeasts, which agrees with their low intron content. The only examples that contribute to the diversity of both the transcriptome and proteome were found in S. cerevisiae. In two reported cases, the protein isoforms encoded by the alternatively spliced transcripts are targeted to different subcellular compartments: PTC7 proteins localize to the nuclear envelope and the mitochondria6 and YCAT proteins to the mitochondria and peroxisomes.7 In the case of YlMDH2, AS also leads to dual localization. We clearly demonstrated by cDNA sequencing that two transcript variants exist, which result from the use of two alternative 3'-splice sites separated by 4 nt. The predicted protein isoforms differ by only two C-terminal amino acids (AN or AKI), the latter of which constitutes a typical PTS1. Visualization of the eYFP-labelled cyto and pero isoforms showed that both proteins localized to their respective predicted compartments.In S. cerevisiae, the distinct phenotypes of mdh2- and mdh3-deleted strains have been extensively studied. The mdh2 mutant, which is equivalent to the Y. lipolytica pero strain (deleted for the cytosolic form), exhibits no growth defect on medium with glucose as a carbon source but is unable to grow on acetate or ethanol in minimum medium.17–19,46,47 We did not observe a similar phenotype for the Y. lipolytica pero strain. In S. cerevisiae, a functional glyoxylate cycle is mandatory for growth on C2 carbon sources and the cytosolic oxaloacetate-malate conversion step by Mdh2p is likely to be required for the glyoxylate cycle.16 Our finding that a Y. lipolytica strain deleted for cytosolic MDH is able to grow on ethanol and acetate suggests that the peroxisomal form can perform the malate–oxaloacetate conversion of the glyoxylate cycle. If we assume that the Y. lipolytica glyoxylate cycle follows the S. cerevisiae model, this result has two implications. First, the cytosolic and peroxisomal MDH proteins in Y. lipolytica must share the same enzymatic activities, which is entirely likely as the two isoforms differ by only two C-terminal amino acids. Moreover, in S. cerevisiae, cytosolic versions of Mdh3p (lacking the PTS1) or Mdh1p (lacking the mitochondrial targeting sequence) are able to complement an mdh2 deletion for growth on ethanol, indicating that all isoforms share similar enzymatic activities despite their amino acid sequence differences.18,50 Second, in cases of growth on C2 compounds, the peroxisomal form may be retained in the cytosol independent of the splicing event and the intermediates of the glyoxylate cycle, i.e. malate and oxaloacetate, may be able to cross the peroxisomal membrane in both directions. Examples of mislocalization of peroxisomal proteins have been reported in S. cerevisiae: Mls1p is sequestered in the cytosol when the yeast is cultivated on ethanol51 and the Mdh3p–GFP fusion protein remained in the cytosol in an mdh2<U+0394> mutant.52 However, an alternative model to that of S. cerevisiae is that the entire glyoxylate cycle takes place in the peroxisome. Indeed, in Y. lipolytica, isocitrate lyase, one of the two enzymes specific to the glyoxylate cycle, is located in peroxisomes, whereas it is located into the cytosol in S. cerevisiae.53 Thus, peroxisomal MDH may be involved in the malate–oxaloacetate conversion. However, the deletion of the peroxisomal form, as exemplified by our cyto strain, had no effect on growth on C2 compounds, suggesting that the S. cerevisiae model also reflects the situation in Y. lipolytica, at least in the absence of peroxisomal MDH.van Roermund et al. reported that growth of the S. cerevisiae mdh3 mutant (peroxisomal form disrupted) on OA was impaired. They showed that ß-oxidation is also impaired in this mutant, which suggested an indirect role for Mdh3p in this process through reoxidation of the NADH generated during the ß-oxidation of fatty acids.45 This relationship has also been demonstrated in Arabidopsis thaliana.54 In Y. lipolytica, strains expressing only the cytosolic MDH (cyto strain) grow as well as the wild-type strain on various lipid substrates and we did not observe any other distinct phenotypes. Thus, the peroxisomal MDH is not essential for NADH reoxidation in the peroxisome. This suggests that reoxidation is carried out by an alternative pathway in peroxisomes and might take the form of shuttles based on either lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) or glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (G3PDH), which are present in mammalian peroxisomes that do not contain MDH.55 This alternative activity remains to be discovered in Y. lipolytica.Several less convincing alternative hypotheses can also be addressed. First, cytosolic MDH may be targeted to the peroxisomes by a PTS distinct from PTS1 or may be imported through a peroxisomal protein complex. Second, the Y. lipolytica peroxisomal membrane may be permeable to NADH metabolites, which would allow NADH recycling through a cytosolic reoxidation. However, this is clearly not the case in S. cerevisiae.45 Third, another ß-oxidation pathway allowing growth on fatty acids in the absence of peroxisomal MDH may exist in Y. lipolytica. In line with this concept, vestigial mitochondrial ß-oxidation may exist in Y. lipolytica.56,57From the sequencing of our cDNA libraries and the RNA-seq data, it appears that YlMDH2 splicing is probably regulated or affected by the carbon source and/or the growth conditions. Several examples of splicing regulation in yeast, principally in S. cerevisiae, are known to exist. The unspliced form of SUS1 mRNA (intron retention) accumulates after a temperature shift.58,59 Splicing of the MER genes in response to sporulation conditions and/or meiosis has also been well documented.3,60–62 AS autoregulation by the protein product of the gene itself, through negative or positive feedback, has been reported for RPL30,63YRA164 and SUS1.58 In Y. lipolytica, regulation of YlMDH2 splicing could thus control the level of MDH in the peroxisome or the cytosol. Dual localization of a protein can be regulated at the level of transcription, usually involving alternative start sites, and at the post-transcriptional level. The differential targeting of YCAT is controlled at the transcriptional level by means of alternative transcription initiation sites, whose frequency of use depends on the carbon source available.7 In the case of PTC7 (intron retention), splicing is not regulated in response to carbon source availability, but the ratio of the two protein isoforms produced by the gene depends on whether the available carbon sources are fermentable or not, indicating that PTC7 isoform production is regulated post-transcriptionally.6Thus, splicing regulation, as well as dual protein localization, appears to be more prevalent in yeasts than previously believed.65 Whether this is reminiscent of ancestral attributes or corresponds to evolutionary changes that led to selective advantages remains to be investigated. Our data illustrate distinct differences in the metabolic behaviour of Y. lipolytica and S. cerevisiae in terms of their glyoxylate and TCA pathways and their MDH enzymatic activities. This underscores a possible role in the adaptation for growth on lipid substrates and for maintaining efficient ß-oxidation across evolution. The AS mechanism that regulates MDH localization in Y. lipolytica remains so far an exclusive innovation of this yeast. YlMDH2 AS regulation and its impact on protein localization and metabolism are under investigation and will provide new insights into the role of splicing on the proteome complexity in Y. lipolytica.We thank François Brunel for RNA-seq library construction, Nicolas Morin for his help in RNA-seq data analysis and Stéphanie Michely for her assistance with R software utilization.

IntroductionIn all organisms, the 20 aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase (AARS) enzymes have to recognize their amino acid substrates and the corresponding tRNA molecules with high precision to produce only legitimate aminoacyl-tRNA products. This exquisite specificity is of central importance as this enables the genetic information to be faithfully translated into protein sequences by following the rules defined in the genetic code. Although principles and many fine details of this selective recognition event have already been discovered,1–4 several questions remained still unanswered.5 tRNA positions that have utmost roles in the selective interaction with the cognate AARS and thus define the identity of the tRNA are denoted as identity elements. While only laboratory experiments can decisively define the identity elements, the large number of potential positions and the laborious nature of the experiments prompted a great variety of bioinformatics studies to predict such elements. These studies require large numbers of individual input tRNA sequences to locate statistically significant identity-related sequence properties. This magnitude of input data became available in the form of genomic DNA sequences, from which tRNA-detecting algorithms6,7 can identify functionally relevant tDNA sequences. Such analyses yielded numerous different tDNA databases.8–10 Several computational studies reported successful functional annotation and in silico identity element determination.11,12 Improved secondary structure-predicting algorithm-driven tRNA alignments13 yielded high-quality input data sets. These high-quality sets allowed for innovative sequence logo and inverse sequence logo-based analyses of tRNA features and identity element predictions.14 An information theory-based approach opened new frontiers in visualizing tRNA sequence features and predicting determinants and anti-determinants.15,16 Computational tRNA identity analysing methods were compared in a recent review of Ardell.17In this paper, we introduce a new approach based on the recently published ‘extended consensus partition’ (ECP) algorithm.18 The ECP algorithm provides a discrete mathematical measure of pairwise distances of functionally related aligned sequence sets. It was first introduced to reveal characteristic sequence features that discriminate the two tRNA sets corresponding to Class I and Class II AARS enzymes.In this study, we applied the ECP algorithm to assess the potential of each tRNA position to discriminate the 20 different tRNA identity sets from each other. The ECP method heavily relies on characteristic positional absence of nucleotide base types. Because of that, the method is sensitive even to the rare occurrence of atypical sequences. For removing such sequences, we filtered the tDNA data sets for the obligatory presence of well-established tRNA features. Moreover, as all bioinformatic studies, the ECP analysis also requires a large number of input sequences. In this case, it is needed to reliably identify nucleotide types that are strictly absent from a given position of the aligned sequence set, i.e. their absence is not due to stochastic sampling error.In order to provide the necessary large input sets, we performed the ECP analyses on the three kingdoms of life instead of individual species. Nevertheless, we aimed to compare tRNA identity sets that contain isofunctional sequences in spite of being originated from different species. Therefore, separately for each identity set, we further filtered the sets for the presence of experimentally verified strictly present identity elements. As a control experiment, we also performed the analysis by omitting this second filtration step.We argued that tRNA molecules sharing a large set of experimentally verified identity elements should interact with their corresponding AARS enzyme similarly and therefore should also share yet unidentified common identity elements.By combining the ECP method with simple statistics, we generated average excluding values (AEVs) providing a measure on the overall discriminating power of each tRNA position. We show that both with and without the second filtering step, positional AEVs correlate with the number of already identified identity elements. We argue that positions having high AEV but lacking already published identity elements predict hitherto undiscovered tRNA identity elements.The analysis located such potential identity elements on the anticodon arm (30:40 and 31:39) and suggests that the core region also contributes to defining tRNA identity.2. Materials and methods2.1. Data set buildingThe tDNA sequences of Bacteria and Eukaryotes were downloaded from the tRNAdb database.9 The Archaea set of this database has not yet contained the recently discovered and characterized19–22 split tRNA, which have been organized in the SPLITSdb database.20 Split tRNA data are already included in the tRNADB-CE database,10 which however (unlike Sprinzl and tRNAdb) does not contain aligned sequences. Therefore, we downloaded both normal and split Archaea tDNA from the tRNADB-CE database and aligned the sequences by the ClustalW software and manually as described by Fujishima et al.23,24 In the case of Archaea data set, we omitted the variable loop sequences from the analysis because of alignment complications.The downloaded set was filtered for sequences that fulfil several criteria.2.2. First filtering step for all data setsIn the first ECP-based study,18 we used the database from the tRNomics study of Marck and Grosjean.25 Although for the present study, we used a larger, updated database, in the case of Bacteria and Eukarya, we could still use the well-established kingdom-specific strictly present elements—as filtering rules—defined by that tRNomics study. For Archaea, we used the filtering rules of Fujishima et al.23 The obligatory presence of these elements established our first filtering criteria. The element sets for the three kingdoms were as follows. Bacteria: H14, G18, R19, Y33, G53:C61, T54, T55, Y56, D57, A58. Archaea: Y8, A14, G15, G18, G19, R21, T33, Y48, G53, T54, T55, C56, R57, A58. Eukarya: Y8, Y11, A14, -17a, G18, G19, R21, R24, H32, Y33, R37, H38, G53, H54, T55, C56, R57, A58, C61. (Note that nucleotides and their sets are denoted by IUPAC nucleotide codes.) Discarding sequences that lacked any of the strictly present kingdom-specific elements removed incorrectly sequenced or most likely non-functional tDNA data.2.3. Second filtering step for the bacterial and eukaryotic data setsWe grouped each sequence based on identity and filtered for the presence of already identified and published major, strictly present identity elements characteristic to the given amino acid identity set.3 These sets for Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae are listed in Supplementary Table S1. By excluding sequences that lacked these elements, we aimed to generate tRNA identity sets that contain isofunctional sequences expected to function in E. coli or yeast, respectively. We argued that if hidden identity elements still exist, those could also be shared by these filtered sequences.Out of the published identity elements, only the determinants were included, while the anti-determinants were not considered. One determinant, the G15:G48 Levitt pair of tRNACys, was omitted from the filtering as this is idiosyncratic to E. coli (more accurately, it could have emerged in the common ancestor of E. coli and Haemophilus influenzae).262.4. Third filtering step for all data setsFinally, in order not to bias the statistical analysis, we removed any redundancy from the data set by keeping only unique sequences.Supplementary Table S2 organized by the three kingdoms contains the species list corresponding to our raw data set and indicates the number of sequences contributed by each species in the raw set and after each filtering step.Supplementary Data S1 shows the resulted sets after the final filtering step. It contains six databases in a multi-fasta format, two for each kingdom. For each kingdom, one database contains a set of non-redundant sequences, while the other set contains all sequences minus the non-redundant set, thus it contains all ‘siblings’.2.5. Determination of discriminating elements by the extended consensus partition algorithmFiltered data sets for each kingdom were analysed by the already published extended consensus partition (ECP) algorithm.18 Principles of the analysis and the algorithm remained the same. However, in this case, not the two AARS-based tRNA classes were compared, but all pairs of the 20 tRNA identity sets. The logic of the algorithm is illustrated in Fig. 1. Because the pairwise ECP analysis is non-symmetrical, from the filtered data set and separately for each kingdom, we produced all 380 (20 × 19) identity pairs. For each pair, we identified the discriminating elements (DEs) through the ECP algorithm as follows. Illustration of calculating the AEV using short artificial sequences. (A) Identifying DEs using an artificial set of short sequences belonging to three amino acid identity sets. Identities are labelled as 1aa, 2aa and 3aa and are highlighted as cyan, yellow and magenta, respectively. Each identity set contains four short, tetramer sequences. The calculated DE is either one base or a combination of bases and it is labelled by IUPAC codes of bases or base sets. Each step of the DE-generating algorithm is explained in Section 2. (B) The calculated DE for each identity pairs. Note that the DE-generating relationship is non-symmetrical, i.e. the 1aa vs. 2aa pair has a DE different from that of the 2aa vs. 1aa pair. (C) Positional summation of DE. Positional sum of the DE values (shown in the lowest row) provides the number of pairwise discriminations provided by the given position. The sums of the DE values are input data for calculating the AEVs).

Formalism and more detailed description are provided in Section 2. This figure can be viewed in colour online.In each identity set and for each kingdom, we scanned the positions of the filtered and aligned9 data set. At each position, we documented the strictly absent elements, i.e. bases that at the given position are missing from each sequence of the given identity set. For each detected strictly absent element, we checked each other identity set in a pairwise manner whether any of the sequences of the other identity set contains that element. If yes, the detected strictly absent element is a DE that discriminates the two identity sets. For each kingdom and each position, these pairwise-interpreted DE elements were documented.Mathematical description of the above procedure is described below.We introduce the variable, Y. Elements of Y are nucleotide bases; therefore, elements are Y<U+2208><U+03C7>, where <U+03C7> = {A,C,G,T}. The value of  is the nucleotide base corresponding to position j (j = 1, …, L, L = 96; from normal position 0 to position 73, including the extra positions from e1 to e22) of the sequence k (k= 1, …, Mi, where the value of Mi varies for individual species) of amino acid identity i (i= 1, …, N, N = 20).2.6. The AEVWe introduced the AEV to determine the weighted average frequency of DE at each position as follows. At each identity set and at each position, we determined how many identity set pairs are discriminated by the given position. These numbers from each set were summed up and were divided by 20 (the number of identities), resulting in the AEVs that demonstrate the discriminating potential of each tRNA position.The n j value is denoted as the AEV.2.7. Statistical analysisWe performed a simple statistical analysis to assess how the positional AEVs relate to the number of hitherto identified identity determinants. We assume that unidentified determinants still exist; therefore, the determinant set is only a subset of all existing elements. The test was done only on the bacterial set because only that sequence set contained enough input sequences. We correlated the AEVs with the number of published determinants (NPDs) with both the Pearson and Spearman analyses.As both types of correlation were relatively weak, we also performed a bootstrap analysis as explained in Supplementary Data S2. In addition, the positional NPD and AEVs were compared with their respective weighted average values and ranked from very low to very high values based on standard deviation.3. Results and discussionThe ECP analysis was performed both on the final filtered data sets and omitting the second filtration step (see later). At each position, the AEV was calculated and compared with the positional NPD value. Positional AEV/NPD values for bacterial and eukaryotic data and AEVs for Archaea are listed in Supplementary Table S3. In Fig. 2 at each position, AEV and NPD values were plotted and colour coded in the same diagram as explained in the figure legend.

The upper column set refers to positional AEVs. The colour codes for statistical analysis. For each kingdom, the weighted average of AEV calculated for all positions from 0 to 73 as a single set and the corresponding standard deviation is as follows: Bacteria 6.45 ± 3.54; Eukaryote 6.31 ± 3.49 and Archaea 6.72 ± 3.69. Segments of columns are colour coded based on their deviation from the weighted average as follows: below -1.5 SD blue; between -1.5 and -0.5 SD cyan; between -0.5 SD and +0.5 SD green; between +0.5 and +1.5 yellow; above +1.5 SD red. White illustrates positions where the analysis is not applicable. These are the 3' CCA end for each kingdom, and the unpopulated e1 position in the Achaea set. The lower column set illustrates the positional NPDs. The logic of the colour-coding scheme is the same as for the AEVs. For each kingdom, the weighted average of NPD calculated for all positions from 0 to 73 as a single set and the corresponding standard deviation is as follows: Bacteria 1.63 ± 3.63; Eukaryote 0.49 ± 1.7.

This figure can be viewed in colour online.The positional AEV/NPD patterns show characteristic similarities. In the following paragraphs, we organized the results from the highest to the lowest AEVs.3.1. Bacterial (coli-like) data setThe density function of the AEVs in the bacterial set shows a normal distribution as the number of positions having values over the weighted average plus 0.5 SD (31 positions) practically equals those that are below the weighted average minus 0.5 SD values (32 positions). In order to facilitate the visual comparison of NPD and the AEVs at each position, these are illustrated in a composite plot as shown in Fig. 2A and B.Importantly, two anticodon positions, 35 and 36, have the highest AEVs (located in the red zone) and these have the highest NPD values as well. On the other hand, position 34 (located in the yellow zone), which pairs with the third, wobbling codon position, has significantly (over one sigma) lower discriminating potential. Notably, out of the three anticodon positions, this contains the lowest NPD as well. Most positions with high AEVs (located in the yellow zone) give place to known identity elements and it is also clear that the AEVs of positions that base pair with each other correlate. In the acceptor arm, three position pairs contain determinant for many identities. These are 1:72 (Trp, Gly, Thr, Gln), 2:71 (Met, Trp, Asp, Gly, Ser, Cys, Ala, Gln) and 3:70 (Val, Met, Trp, Gly, Ser, Cys, Ala, Gln), which as a set carry known determinants for half of the identities.3 The discriminator base in position 73 has the third highest AEV right behind positions 35 and 36.In the tRNA core region,27 the 12:23 pair having high AEVs overlaps with the know tRNAIle identity element T12:A23. Furthermore, high AEV positions 13, 22 and 46 have a published role as tRNAGlu identity element T13:G22:A4628–30 and deletion of position 47 with high AEV was also identified as tRNAGlu determinant. The 13:22 pair has been identified as determinant for tRNACys as well.31,32Other positions having higher than average AEVs host several identity elements as follows. Position 38 in the anticodon loop contains determinant for tRNAIle, tRNAAsp and tRNAGln,33,34 while positions 10 (tRNAAsp, tRNAGln); 11:24 (tRNASer, tRNAGlu); 15:84 (tRNACys, tRNAPro); 20 (tRNAPhe, tRNAArg, tRNAAla); 29:41 (tRNAIle) and 45 (tRNAPhe) also have a few indicated determinants.3,35At the more conserved T-loop position 60 having average AEV, there is another tRNAPhe determinant.3,35 The variable loop position having the highest, but otherwise average, AEV is e2, which is a known identity element of tRNASer.36The position pair 31:39 at the anticodon loop has no known identity element associated. In 2338 out of the 2406 analysed non-redundant bacterial sequences, these form normal Watson–Crick base pair, but based on the high AEVs, the exact identity of the given base pair might serve an identity element function.Based on the high AEV but low NPD values, position pairs 12:23 and 13:22 as well as Position 46 might contain hitherto unidentified determinants.The facultative elements (17, 17a, 20a and 20b) in the D-loop and in position 47 might also have identity functions (that will be detailed in Section 3.5).Several elements with the lowest AEVs indicated in blue in Fig. 2A and C do not show any discrimination potentials. These are functionally highly conserved elements shared by all tRNA sequences and most of these were used in the first filtering step. Positions with still lower than average AEVs highlighted with cyan or those with average AEV highlighted as green typically coincide with regions that do not contain known identity elements. For example, at the 6:67 pair, the NPD is zero. Nevertheless, there are some exceptions. For the 5:68 position pair, a single identity element has been published, the A5:T68 for tRNAMet.37 Moreover, the conserved A37 in the anticodon loop has been identified as Ile, Met, Glu and Gln determinant,27,37–40 although over half of the tRNA sequences harbour adenine at this position. Finally, in spite of being located at low AEV regions, the U8:A14 for tRNALeu41 and the G27:C43, G28:C42 and T59 for tRNAPhe have also been shown to be determinants.423.2. Eukaryotic (yeast-like) data setWhile the bacterial data set represented coli-like identity rules, the eukaryotic set contained sequences that conformed to the already established yeast identity rules. The results are illustrated in Fig. 2 in the same way as for the bacterial set.Just like in the case of the bacterial set, the majority of known determinants are located at positions having the highest AEVs, namely the three anticodon positions and the discriminator position 73. The three base pairs of the acceptor arm have the next highest NPD values and these also represent higher than average AEVs. Another high AEV position where a single known identity element for tRNAPhe exists is position 20.43There are several positions where higher than average AEVs exist, but no determinants have been identified. At some of these positions such as 12:23; 13:22 and 45; 46; 47 that participate in establishing the core region, there are already published determinants for the bacterial set.Interestingly, the high AEV positions 31:39 and 30:40 in the anticodon stem contain no identified yeast determinants, but harbour published determinants for human tRNAPhe.44The lower than average AEVs indicated with blue and cyan colours in Fig. 2C and D are again all associated with conserved positions lacking any known identity elements. Very few published identity elements coincide with positions having average AEVs indicated with green in Fig. 2C and D. Position 3 harbours determinants for tRNAGly and tRNAAla, the anticodon loop position 37 for tRNALeu and positions 38 and 10:25 for tRNAAsp.45–49 Position 70, which pairs with position 3, has a higher than average AEV.3.3. Testing potential biases introduced by the second filtering stepWe have checked how the second filtering step alters the input sequence set from various species. For bacteria, the effect of filtering nicely mirrored evolutionary relations. Data in Supplementary Table S2 show that after the second filtering step, species containing the highest number of retained sequences are the closest relatives of E. coli. Namely, from the Gammaproteobacteria class (genera Escherichia, Haemophilus, Salmonella, Yersinia, Buchnera, Shigella), 75–90% of the input sequences are retained by the second filtering step. Moving away from E. coli on the phylogenetic tree, the proportion of retained sequences gradually decreases. Still high (around 70%) proportion of sequences are retained in the case of Proteobacteria (genera Desulfovibrio, Brucella, Campylobacter), but, for example, in the case of Firmicutes (genera Streptococcus, Bacillus, Lactobacillus, Lactococcus, Staphylococcus) only 50–70%, while in the case of Tenericutes (Mycoplasma, Ureaplasma) or Actinobacteria (Mycobacterium, Streptomyces), only 30–50% of the input sequences are retained.In the case of Eukarya, no such trend was observed. This might be due to the—compared with bacteria—much lower number and possibly more general nature of determinants published for yeast.The positional AEVs measure the average distance of functionally defined sets. One might think that the second filtering for the presence of identity elements could increase the separation of the identity sets and thus increase the AEVs at identity element positions. In order to assess this potential effect, we repeated the analysis for the bacterial and the eukaryotic sets by omitting the second filtration. The data are organized in Supplementary Table S3, Table 1 and Supplementary Figure S1. Representative data for tDNA sequence set processing and analysis with and without filtering for the presence of known identity elementsaThe optional second filtration was performed based on the presence of experimentally verified E. coli (for Bacteria) or yeast (for Eukaryota) identity elements. Archaea lack enough verified identity elements; therefore, the second filtration was not performed.bCorrelation of the NPDs and the AEVs was done as described in Section 2.cThe bootstrap analysis is described in Supplementary Data S2.Representative data for tDNA sequence set processing and analysis with and without filtering for the presence of known identity elementsaThe optional second filtration was performed based on the presence of experimentally verified E. coli (for Bacteria) or yeast (for Eukaryota) identity elements. Archaea lack enough verified identity elements; therefore, the second filtration was not performed.bCorrelation of the NPDs and the AEVs was done as described in Section 2.cThe bootstrap analysis is described in Supplementary Data S2.Briefly, in the case of the bacterial data set, where 40 positions carry known identity elements, second filtration removed 39% of the input sequences, e.g. those that lacked at least one required coli identity element. As a result, at positions, where known identity elements exist (positive NPD), the sum of the AEV increased with 22%, while at positions with no reported identity elements (zero NPD), the increase was only 8%. Out of the 40 positions, this AEV increase exceeded the standard deviation at 10 positions.In the case of the eukaryotic data set, where only 15 positions carry known identity elements, second filtration caused a much smaller effect. It removed only 15% of the input sequences, e.g. those that lacked at least one required yeast identity element. As a result, at positions where known identity elements exist (positive NPD), the sum of the AEV decreased with 5%, while at positions with no reported identity elements (zero NPD), the decrease was 9%. However, this decrease was statistically significant only at position 23, where no identity element has been reported.For the bacterial set, we performed several statistical analyses both in the case of the second filtered and non-filtered data sets (Table 1). The Pearson correlation gave an R-value of 0.55 for the filtered and 0.53 for the non-filtered case, while the Spearmen correlation yielded <U+03C1>-values 0.54 and 0.39, respectively.We also applied a bootstrap analysis to test the statistical significance of high AEV positions overlapping with positions harbouring known identity elements (Table 1, Supplementary Data S2). Importantly, the overlap was statistically significant both in the non-filtered and in the filtered case, demonstrating that omitting the second filtration step did not change the overall distribution of the AEVs. The highest AEVs are at the anticodon positions, the discriminator base and the acceptor arm (1:72; 2:71). These are well-known positions of identity elements.This suggests that this filtration does not introduce artefacts. On the other hand, as we emphasized, only the second filtration yields a data set, in which sequences belonging to the same identity set share known identity elements, suggesting that they might also share yet unidentified common identity elements.3.4. Archaea data setThe second filtration step was not performed for the Archaea data set as only sparse experimental data are available for such elements (listed in Table 2). The only comprehensive analysis available for each identity set is an in silico study based on sequence alignments.50Experimentally determined and published Archaea identity elementsExperimentally determined and published Archaea identity elementsPositions of typical determinants, such as the discriminator base or members of the anticodon, have significantly higher than average AEVs (yellow and red zones in Fig. 2A and C). For some Archaea species and some identity sets, these have been experimentally verified as determinants (see in Table 2). However, it is noteworthy how differently the individual kingdoms (or sometimes groups within a kingdom) use identity elements on the acceptor stem. This can be illustrated through the example of tRNAThr.In the case of E. coli,51 the discriminator base is not a tRNAThr determinant, while the first three base pairs (1:72; 2:71; 3:70) are identity elements. The most important one is the 2:71 pair. For yeast,52 the discriminator base and the first and third acceptor stem base pairs are determinants, and similar results were published for the Thermus thermophilus bacterium.53 Studies on the tRNAThr identity elements for two Archaea species revealed that their discriminator base and acceptor stem base pairs are used differently. In the case of Haloferax volcanii, these were used similarly as in yeast and T. thermophilus, while in Aeropyrum pernix, these elements were used as in E. coli.54 Based on the AEVs at this area in the archahea set, the majority of the Archaea might have an identity element distribution like that in A. pernix. Moreover, the role of the discriminator base relative to the anticodon set appears to be dampened in this kingdom, suggesting that it might have roles in fewer identity sets than in the other two kingdoms.The 3:70 base pair positions have excelling AEVs and this pair was shown to be determinant for tRNAAla, tRNAGly and tRNASer in a few Archaea species (Table 2). Position 20 also has a higher than average AEV (yellow zone) and this position carries an identity element for tRNAPhe in Archaea.55The position pairs 29:41 and 31:39 at the anticodon stem also have higher than average AEVs, yet no determinants have been identified at these positions. On the other hand, in the case of Methanosarcina barkeri, at the 30:40 pair having average or low AEV, a Ser identity element has been found.56 Just like in the case of the bacterial set, there are several positions in the core region and at the facultative base positions where the AEVs are higher than average, yet no identity element has been published. Hitherto unidentified potential identity elements. Positions having high AEV but low NPDs could harbour hitherto unidentified identity elements. Grey or black highlights the most likely positions of such elements. For positions highlighted as black, we also propose the corresponding identity: bold corresponding to yeast, while italic to E. coli. Middle grey highlights ‘core region’ positions having high AEV and low NPD in all three kingdoms. Light grey highlights the highest AEV base pair in the Archaea kingdom.Hitherto unidentified potential identity elements.

Middle grey highlights ‘core region’ positions having high AEV and low NPD in all three kingdoms. Light grey highlights the highest AEV base pair in the Archaea kingdom.Similar to the bacterial set, the AEV of position 34 is lower than those of positions 35 and 36. However, in this case, position 34 has a much lower, only average AEV (green zone), while in bacteria, it belonged to the highest category (red zone).Positions having the lowest AEVs, just like in the case of the bacterial data set, are located at conserved tRNA architecture defining positions. A noteworthy difference compared with the bacterial data is that in Archaea, the 1:72 position pair has only average AEVs (Fig. 2A and C). This appears to be due to the fact that in ~90% of the Archaea tRNA sequences, there is a G1:C72 pair at this position. Based on the already published sequence analysis,50 the only few exceptions are detected for the initiator tRNAMet and for tRNAGln and tRNATyr. The C1:G72 pair of tRNATyr has been experimentally verified to be a genuine identity element.57,583.5. Potential hidden identity elementsPositions having higher than average AEVs but containing no published determinants that would have been used in our second filtering step might harbour hitherto unidentified determinants. The most likely hidden identity elements are illustrated in Fig. 3. We searched the literature for any identified determinants at such positions reported for species other than coli-like bacteria or yeast. Such cases were already mentioned above for the 30:40 and 31:39 base pairs that are identified human determinants.44 Therefore, we analysed these two base pairs by checking our data set for each identity set. As a simplest scenario, we searched for base pairs that, in any one of the 20 identity sets, differ from all other 19 sets. In the bacterial set, there was a single such case, a normal Watson–Crick base pair, while for the eukaryotic set, all such pairs were non-Watson–Crick base pairs.This base pair is present in the tRNATrp sequences in all but a very few species that provided tRNATrp sequences to our filtered coli-like data set. In four coli-like species, only a single tRNASer, while in two species, only a single tRNAGln, has the same base pair. We note that only the anticodon loop, the discriminator base and the acceptor stem were experimentally tested for coli tRNATrp determinants,59–61 thus the T31:A39 pair might be a hitherto undetected identity element.This unconventional base pair is characteristic to eukaryotic elongator tRNAMet. Both eukaryotic as well as coli initiator tRNAMet and the coli elongator tRNAMet contain a normal G31:C39 pair at these positions. In the coli initiator tRNA, the normal G31:C39 base pair is required for binding to the P site on the ribosome and for protein synthesis initiation, while in the coli elongator tRNAMet, the same pair is required for proper acylation by the corresponding AARS enzyme. Eukaryotic initiator tRNAMet from a wide source were shown to be good substrates of the coli Met-RS enzyme, while the eukaryotic elongator tRNAMet from the same wide source were all poor substrates. When the original T31:T39 pair in the eukaryotic tRNAMet was replaced with a G31:C39 pair, it became a good substrate for the coli enzyme, and symmetrically, when the G31:C39 pair was replaced with a T31:T39 pair in the coli elongator tRNAMet, it became a good substrate for the eukaryotic enzyme. Thus, the kingdom-specific base pair is a determinant in both kingdoms. Moreover, it was also shown that in the elongator tRNA, it is not the identity of the bases that matter, but the fact whether these form a Watson–Crick base pair or not. If they do, the corresponding tRNAMet is a good substrate of the bacterial enzyme and a poor substrate of the eukaryotic enzyme. If they do not, the corresponding tRNAMet is a good substrate for the eukaryotic enzyme and a poor substrate for the bacterial enzyme. Thus, a Watson–Crick base pair at these positions or the lack of it affects the structure and/or malleability of the anticodon loop, which has an important role in the proper interaction with the AARS enzyme.It has also been shown that replacing the G31:C39 base pair with a T31:T39 pair in the yeast initiatior tRNA renders it being able to participate in the elongation phase.Note that this base pair has not been defined as a determinant per se, as the studies compared either isospecific elongator tRNAs from two different kingdoms or elongator vs. initiator tRNAs rather than two different elongator tRNA identities from the same species.62–64In the case of yeast tRNAIle, only the three anticodon positions were studied as identity elements,65 and the potential role of this nearby non-Watson–Crick base pair has not been tested. In our data set, this base pair is present in the majority of eukaryotic species from Arabidopsis through Drosophila to Human for several Ile isoacceptors, suggesting that this base pair might have an identity defining role.At the same positions as for tRNAIle, a different non-Watson-Crick base pair is present in yeast tRNAAsp sequences. This base pair is not conserved in eukaryotic species. In our data set, it is present only in yeast and Caenorhabditis elegans. As high AEVs suggest that the G30:T40 pair might be an identity element in yeast (and also in C. elegans), we checked the PDB for other yeast tRNA/AARS complex structures. Unfortunately, besides the Asp,66 only two other structures are available. One is for tRNATyr (PDB: 2DLC), which is incomplete, and another one for tRNAArg.67 Both have a normal G30:C40 base pair. Note that ArgRS and TyrRS belong to Class I, while AspRS belongs to Class II. As enzymes from the two classes approach the tRNA from opposite sides, we did not expect any similarities in the enzyme–tRNA interactions themselves.As could be expected, the interactions are not homologous. In the case of tRNAAsp, the ribose-phosphate portion of G30 is in 2.9–3.3 Å (there are two complexes in the unit cell) distance from the Lys88 side chain of the enzyme, which suggests a salt bridge between the tRNA and the enzyme at this position. The equivalent residue of the AspRS Lys88 in the ArgRS is Lys78, which does not interact with the tRNA. On the other hand in the tRNAArg structure, the phosphate of C40 appears to form a H-bond with Ser440 of the enzyme, which is in 2.6 Å distance. The incomplete tRNATyr structure either does not have an interaction with the enzyme at this position or it is not resolved in the model. It is plausible that a G:T pair is disrupted more readily than a G:C pair. It appears that such local disruption of a G:T pair is required for forming a stable salt bridge with the enzyme in the case of tRNAAsp. On the other hand, tRNAArg has a different stabilizing interaction, which does not necessitate such a local perturbation.We also checked whether a different base pair exists at these positions in bacterial tRNAAsp and if so, whether it affects the recognition mode by their respective AARS enzymes. In the coli tRNA homologue, there is a traditional G30:C40 pair and fortunately there is a tRNA:AARS complex structure for bacterial tRNAAsp in the PDB,68 so we could compare the two homologous interactions from the two different kingdoms. Differences are shown in Fig. 4. As already mentioned, in the yeast system, the ribose-phosphate portion of G30 of the tRNA forms a salt bridge with the Lys88 side chain of the enzyme. A Needleman–Wunsch alignment of the coli and yeast synthetase sequences identified Lys58 as the coli equivalent of Lys88. This side chain is in 10.3 Å distance from the G30 phosphate moiety therefore no salt bridge is formed. This comparison clearly shows that identical tRNA positions are differently recognized by the two iso-functional AARS enzymes. Comparison of tRNAAsp/AspRS structures from E. coli and yeast.

This figure can be viewed in colour online.Furthermore, the observed direct interaction of the G30:T40 pair with the AARS enzyme suggests that it might be an identity element in yeast.In E. coli, it has been shown that the core region, formed by the 15:48 pair and by [13:20]:46, has identity functions. The G15:G48 was shown to be a Cys identity element.26 The core region was shown to be important for tRNAPro identity69 and for discriminating tRNAGlu from tRNAAsp.30 While in the bacterial set, the 15:48 pair has medium level (green zone) AEV, positions 22 and 46 have high (yellow zone) and position 13 very high (red zone) AEV. The eukaryote set also shows high AEVs at these positions (all in the yellow zone), suggesting that the core region might have similar identity roles in the eukaryotic kingdom as well.703.6. ConclusionsDeciphering identity elements of tRNAs has been one of the most interesting problems of molecular biology that has a long and successful history.2–5 It is unquestionable that only properly designed mutations combined with in vitro and/or in vivo experiments can identify such elements beyond any doubts. However, the large number of even the ‘reasonable’ mutations and the astronomical number of their combinations renders these laborious studies rather challenging. As a consequence, the existing collection of already determined identity element set cannot be considered complete, and several bioinformatics studies aimed to predict hitherto hidden such elements.6,13–17 Most of these studies applied classical sequence analysing tools and searched for conserved sequence features.The ECP analysis, on the other hand, is based on strictly absent elements and provides a simple but meaningful measure of pairwise mathematical distances of functionally related sequence sets.18The reliability of bioinformatic studies is strongly related to the number of input sequences that are compared. Individual species have only a few tRNA sequences for each identity set. Comparing tRNA sequences from a pool of related species could improve the signal/noise ratio of the analysis, but it can be justified only if the comparison is functionally relevant, i.e. tRNA from one species would be properly charged by the corresponding AARS from the other species.We produced starting data sets, in which sequences grouped for the 20 identity from bacteria were filtered for the presence of major coli identity elements while eukaryotic sequences for the presence of yeast identity elements. We argue that common presence of such identity elements in the starting data set favours interspecies compatibility. If so, isofunctional tRNAs from different species sharing already published identity elements should also share their yet undiscovered determinants as well. It means that such an analysis should identify elements that have not been recognized yet and in the same time identify those too that had already been published, but not included in the filtering set. If hitherto unknown elements are detected, they should be considered potential identity elements only in bacterial or eukaryotic species that also use the coli or the yeast identity element sets, respectively, that were applied for filtering. Thus, this analysis could clearly miss elements that are not conserved across species.We demonstrated that positional AEVs measure sequence feature distances of functional groups and correlate with the number of already identified determinants (Table 1). Based on the above arguments, we suggested that positions having high AEV but few or no identified determinants predict locations of hidden identity elements. We listed the most characteristic such positions and for one of these suggested a structural rationale for being identity element.We also showed that omitting the second filtration in the case of both Bacteria and Eukarya still preserves the characteristic pattern of high AEV positions, which overlaps with the positions of the most important identity elements such as the anticodon bases and the discriminator base.In this study, we have demonstrated that the ECP algorithm is capable of assessing the level of discriminating power of positions in separating functionally different sequence sets. As genomic sequencing continues at an increasing rate, our ECP analysis can be performed over and over on ever-increasing filtered databases.We believe that when enough input data are available, we can analyse the discriminating power not only of individual positions but combinations of positions as well.Nevertheless, only carefully designed mutations and laboratory experiments can assess the predicting potentials of the ECP algorithm to identify hidden determinants.The authors are grateful to Dr Catherine Florentz for critical reading of the manuscript and for her highly valuable suggestions.

We concluded that AdpA directly controls >500 genes in cooperation with other regulatory proteins. A comprehensive competitive gel mobility shift assay of AdpA with 304 selected AdpA-binding sites revealed several unique characteristics of the DNA-binding property of AdpA. This study provides the first experimental insight into the extent of the AdpA regulon, indicating that many genes are under the direct control of AdpA.1. IntroductionThe Gram-positive, soil-inhabiting, filamentous bacterial genus Streptomyces is characterized by its ability to produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites. Another characteristic feature of the genus is its complex multicellular development. Spores germinate to form a branched, multinucleoid substrate mycelium, which then produces an aerial mycelium. After septa have been formed at regular intervals along the aerial hyphae, long chains of uninucleoid spores are formed. Generally, secondary metabolites begin to be produced after the onset of morphological differentiation. Many genes required for these two events are coordinately regulated. However, the regulatory networks of such genes are largely unknown.In the streptomycin producer Streptomyces griseus, a microbial hormone, A-factor (2-isocapryloyl-3-R-hydroxymethyl-<U+03B3>-butyrolactone), triggers both secondary metabolism and morphological differentiation. We have long studied the A-factor regulatory cascade. A-factor switches on the transcription of adpA by binding to ArpA, the A-factor receptor protein that binds to the promoter of adpA, and dissociating DNA-bound ArpA from the DNA.1 AdpA, an AraC/XylS family transcriptional regulator, activates a number of genes required for morphological differentiation and secondary metabolite formation.2 Thus, an adpA-deleted (<U+0394>adpA) mutant cannot exhibit morphological development or production of many (but not all) secondary metabolites. Our transcriptome analysis showed that 639 and 373 genes were transcriptionally downregulated and upregulated, respectively, in the <U+0394>adpA mutant, when compared with the wild-type strain.3Up until 2006, we had demonstrated that AdpA directly activates 14 transcripts (17 genes), which include several genes encoding key regulators of secondary metabolism and morphological differentiation, extracellular proteases and an extracellular protease inhibitor protein, and proteins of unknown function.2,4 The 14 AdpA-target promoters are termed ‘category-I’ promoters hereafter. Twenty AdpA-binding sites were identified in the upstream (or just downstream, in the case of adsA) region of the promoters; these are termed ‘category-I’ AdpA-binding sites hereafter. Recent DNA microarray analysis, in which the effect of exogenously supplemented A-factor on the transcriptome in an A-factor-deficient mutant was determined, and comprehensive electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) suggested 34 candidates for novel AdpA-target promoters.5 Furthermore, our proteome analysis of extracellular proteins resulted in the identification of 11 novel candidates for AdpA-target promoters, 4 of which were included in the 34 candidates.6 These results indicate that AdpA directly activates a considerable number of genes. We have already determined a consensus AdpA-binding sequence, 5'-TGGCSNGWWY-3' (S: G or C, W: A or T, Y: C or T, and N: A, C, G, or T),7 which is not strict compared with the consensus binding sequences of well-known bacterial global transcriptional regulators, such as cAMP-receptor protein (CRP),8 LexA,9 and Spo0A.10 Accordingly, a bioinformatics search predicted more than 40 000 AdpA-binding sites in the genome of S. griseus. It is rather unlikely that AdpA binds to all the predicted sites; thus, actual AdpA-binding sites cannot be found by in silico analysis alone.In the present study, we performed chromatin affinity precipitation (ChAP),11 as well as chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), in combination with high-throughput sequencing technology, to determine the distribution of AdpA across the entire S. griseus chromosome. DNA fragments obtained by ChIP or ChAP were identified with a high-throughput sequencer, which promised higher spatial resolution and sensitivity than microarray-based methods (e.g. ChIP-chip analysis).12 By the ChIP/ChAP-seq analysis, we were able to take snapshots of the distribution of AdpA across the chromosome in living S. griseus cells, not only in liquid culture, but also in solid culture. This information, in combination with transcriptional profiling using DNA microarray, comprehensive EMSA, and in silico prediction of AdpA-binding sites, revealed the extent and complexity of the AdpA regulatory network.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains and growth conditionsThe wild-type strain S. griseus IFO13350 and the adpA mutant were described previously.1 Strains were cultured as described previously.132.2. In vivo cross-linking of AdpA and DNAFor in vivo cross-linking of AdpA and DNA in cells of liquid culture, the <U+0394>adpA strain expressing Nhis-adpA was grown in 100 ml YMPD for 18 h at 30°C and treated with formaldehyde (1% final concentration) for 15 min at room temperature. For in vivo cross-linking of AdpA and DNA in cells of solid culture, the same strain was grown on an YMPD-cellophane plate for 1, 2, and 3 days at 28°C. The mycelia were collected with a spatula, resuspended with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and treated with formaldehyde (1% final concentration) for 20 min at room temperature. In both cases, formaldehyde was quenched by adding glycine to a final concentration of 250 mM. Finally, the cells were washed with tris-buffered saline buffer (pH 7.5) more than twice and stored at -80°C until use.2.3. Chromatin immunoprecipitationCross-linked cells in 1-ml ChIP buffer (50 mM HEPES–KOH, 140 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1% Triton X-100, and 0.1% sodium deoxycolate, pH 7.5) were sonicated on ice to give an average DNA fragment size of 300–600 bp. After centrifugation at 12 000g for 10 min, the supernatant was collected and diluted with ChIP buffer (a final protein concentration of 3–5 mg/ml). At the same time, 50 µl of anti-mouse IgG dynabeads (Invitrogen), which had been washed twice with PBS containing 5 mg/ml bovine serum albumin (BSA), was mixed with anti-poly-histidine antibody (Qiagen) at 4°C for 4 h, washed twice with 1 ml of PBS–BSA, and resuspended with PBS–BSA. The anti-poly-histidine antibody-conjugated beads were added to the 1 ml of the diluted supernatant, followed by incubation for 6 h at 4°C with gentle rotation. The beads were then washed once with ChIP buffer, once with ChIP high-salt buffer (ChIP buffer containing 300 mM NaCl), twice with ChIP wash buffer (100 mM Tris–HCl, 250 mM LiCl, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Nonidet P-40, and 0.5% sodium deoxycolate, pH 8.0), and twice with TE (10 mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). Proteins bound to the beads were eluted with 100 µl of elution buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl, 10 mM EDTA, and 1% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS), pH 8.0]. After the cross-linking between AdpA and the DNA was destroyed by heating at 65°C overnight, 300 µl of TE was added to the reverse-cross-linked sample. The sample was then treated with RNase A (a final concentration of 0.4 mg/ml) for 2 h at 37°C and with proteinase K (a final concentration of 0.2 mg/ml) for 2 h at 55°C. Finally, DNA fragments were purified by Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).2.4. Chromatin affinity precipitationCross-linked cells in 1-ml ChAP buffer [25 mM HEPES–KOH, 10 mM imidazole, 6 M guanidine-HCl, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.5% Triton X-100, and 10% (w/v) glycerol, pH 7.5] were sonicated on ice to give an average DNA fragment size of 300–600 bp. After centrifugation at 12 000g for 10 min, the supernatant was collected and diluted with ChAP buffer (a final protein concentration of 3–5 mg/ml). Fifty microlitres of dynabeads TALON (Invitrogen), which had been washed twice with ChAP buffer, were then added to the 1 ml of the diluted supernatant, followed by incubation for 2 h at room temperature with gentle rotation. The beads were washed four times with ChAP buffer and twice with TE. DNAs bound to the beads were eluted with 100 µl of elution buffer (50 mM Tris–HCl, 0.5 M imidazole, and 0.5% SDS, pH 7.5). After cross-linking between AdpA and DNA was destroyed by heating at 65°C overnight, reverse cross-linked DNA was purified by phenol–chloroform treatment and ethanol precipitation. The DNA pellet was resuspended in 100-µl TE containing 25 µg/ml RNase A, followed by incubation for 2 h at 37°C. DNA fragments were finally purified by Qiaquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen).2.5. Sequencing of the DNA fragments enriched by ChIP or ChAPDNA samples were submitted to Takara Bio for sequencing using an Illumina Genome Analyzer II. Libraries were prepared according to the manufacture's instructions. Sequence reads were mapped to the genome of S. griseus using Bowtie.14 Parameters were set to allow mapping of reads to the genome with up to two mismatches. Reads mapped to multiple sites, except for those to terminal inverted repeats and rRNA gene clusters, were excluded from the analysis. Reads were clustered and analysed by CisGenome.152.6.

Accession numberAll microarray and ChIP-seq data have been deposited in the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO; http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) under accession number GSE33994.3. Results3.1. Expression of polyHis-tagged AdpA in S. griseusFor ChIP and ChAP analyses, <U+0394>adpA strains producing AdpA with a polyHis-tag at either its N- or C-terminus (N-His-AdpA and AdpA-C-His, respectively) were generated. The defects in morphological differentiation (Fig. 1A) and streptomycin production (Fig. 1B) of the <U+0394>adpA strain were completely complemented by the production of N-His-AdpA and AdpA-C-His proteins, as well as by the native AdpA protein, demonstrating that the attached polyHis-tag did not interfere the in vivo function of AdpA. Western blotting analysis with an anti-polyHis-tag antibody showed that the amount of AdpA increased gradually during the exponential growth phase and then decreased gradually during the stationary phase in the mycelium cultured in the nutrient-rich YMPD liquid medium (Fig. 1C). Maximal accumulation of AdpA was observed at 18 h, when the growth became slower than that in the exponential growth phase (Fig. 1D). Western blotting analysis with N-His-AdpA-expressing strain showed that the C-terminal portion of AdpA was partially degraded on solid culture (Supplementary Fig. S1). Degradation of the polyHis-containing C-terminal portion of AdpA-C-His should be also possible; therefore, we used the <U+0394>adpA strain producing N-His-AdpA, not AdpA-C-His, for further analyses. The polyHis-tag attached does not interfere with the in vivo function of AdpA. (A) Restoration of morphological differentiation in the <U+0394>adpA mutant by the production of polyHis-tagged AdpA. Strains were grown on YMPD agar for 3 days at 28°C. (B) Restoration of streptomycin production in the <U+0394>adpA mutant by the production of polyHis-tagged AdpA. After the indicated strains were grown on YMP (YMPD without glucose) agar for 4 days at 28°C, an indicator strain was overlaid and incubated overnight at 28°C. (C) Western blotting analysis of polyHis-tagged AdpA. Total protein was extracted at 6 (Lane 1), 12 (Lane 2), 18 (Lane 3), 24 (Lane 4), and 36 (Lane 5) h of liquid culture and 6 µg of each was subjected to electrophoresis. Arrow indicates polyHis-tagged AdpA. Note that western blotting analysis gave stronger signals to purified AdpA-C-His than to purified N-His-AdpA when equal amounts of them were subjected to electrophoresis (data not shown). Therefore, intracellular levels of N-His-AdpA and AdpA-C-His seem to be similar, although AdpA-C-His gave stronger signals than N-His-AdpA.

Genome-wide distribution of AdpA across the chromosome of the mycelium in liquid cultureWe performed ChAP-seq and ChIP-seq analyses using the N-His-AdpA-producing <U+0394>adpA strain cultured in the YMPD liquid medium for 18 h. Although these two analyses are based on different principles to enrich the AdpA-bound DNA fragments, very similar results were obtained; the correlation coefficient of signal intensity of peaks obtained from ChIP-seq and ChAP-seq was 0.84 (Supplementary Fig. S2). As an example, Fig. 2A shows a small fraction of the result, in which the binding of AdpA on a 50-kb region containing sgmA is depicted. Peaks obtained from both analyses were in good agreement with the known AdpA-binding sites (Sites A and B) for sgmA.7 Regarding Site A, peaks from ChIP-seq and ChAP-seq analyses are shifted from the actual binding site by only 36 and 11 bp, respectively. On the other hand, a peak is located right on Site B (Fig. 2B) in both analyses. Furthermore, we confirmed that a peak was invariably detected within 50 bp from all ‘category-I’ AdpA-binding sites, except the AdpA-binding site of sgiA (AdBS-sgiA), which was not detected (see below). Thus, we successfully obtained a high-resolution map of the in vivo AdpA-binding regions. Figure 3 shows the entire AdpA-binding chromosome map obtained by ChAP; genome-wide distribution of AdpA across the chromosome is obvious. ChIP/ChAP-seq analysis of AdpA. The results of ChAP-seq (upper) and ChIP-seq (lower) are shown. (A) A 50-kb region containing sgmA. (B) A 2-kb region containing sgmA.

The result of ChAP-seq analysis is shown. Horizontal lines indicated by arrows represent the threshold for AdpA binding. The chromosome of S. griseus has terminal inverted repeats (TIR), which are identical 13920-bp sequences, at both ends. AdpA binding cannot be distinguished between the right and left TIR sequences in ChIP/ChAP-seq analysis. Therefore, the intensity of signals detected on TIR is equally divided between right and left TIR sequences.Genome-wide distribution of AdpA. The result of ChAP-seq analysis is shown.

AdpA binding cannot be distinguished between the right and left TIR sequences in ChIP/ChAP-seq analysis. Therefore, the intensity of signals detected on TIR is equally divided between right and left TIR sequences.In both analyses, the signal intensity of the AdpA-binding site for adsA (AdBS-adsA) was lowest among all of the ‘category-I’ AdpA-binding sites, except AdBS-sgiA. Therefore, we used this value as a threshold to exclude background noise in each analysis; peaks with signal intensities equal to or more than that of AdBS-adsA were considered as candidates for AdpA-binding sites (Fig. 3). Finally, 1355 sites, which were detected in both analyses, were regarded as the in vivo AdpA-binding sites.We classified these sites into three groups by their location in relation to the surrounding genes. First, ‘putative regulatory region’: from -600 to +100 of protein-coding genes (taking a putative translational start site as +1) and -300 to +50 for RNA genes (taking a transcriptional start point of RNA gene as +1). Secondly, ‘coding region’: from +101 to the 3'-terminus (excluding AdpA-binding sites that can be considered as ‘putative regulatory region’ for downstream genes). The last group contained the remainder, which was classified as ‘intergenic region’ (Table 1). This classification suggested that 69% of the AdpA-binding sites were located in ‘putative regulatory regions’ and 31% of them were on regions that appeared not to affect transcription (i.e. ‘coding’ and ‘intergenic’ regions).

Relationship between AdpA binding and transcriptional regulationWe examined whether AdpA binding to each ‘putative regulatory region’ could affect transcription of the target gene. For protein-coding genes, gene expression profiles were compared by DNA microarray analysis between the N-His-AdpA-producing <U+0394>adpA strain and the <U+0394>adpA strain containing the empty integration vector pTYM19 on the chromosome. The transcriptome analysis showed that 736 and 457 genes were expressed at higher and lower levels, respectively, in the N-His-AdpA-producing strain when compared with the control <U+0394>adpA strain (fold change =2 and =0.5, respectively, and P-value <0.05). We obtained expression data of 662 genes from among the 796 genes that have one or more in vivo AdpA-binding sites in their ‘putative regulatory region’. Thus, we could evaluate the apparent significance of 743 of the 892 in vivo AdpA-binding sites in ‘putative regulatory region’; 214 sites (for 175 transcriptional units) and 89 sites (for 81 transcriptional units) were apparently involved in transcriptional activation and repression, respectively. We also examined apparent significance of several AdpA-binding sites in the ‘putative regulatory region’ for tRNA genes and rRNA genes (Supplementary Fig. S3). Expression of only bldA (trn42) was higher in the N-His-AdpA-producing strain when compared with the control <U+0394>adpA strain. We have confirmed that transcription of bldA is activated by AdpA.13Altogether, we evaluated the apparent significance of 773 sites of the 922 in vivo AdpA-binding sites in ‘putative regulatory regions’. Of 773 sites, 215 sites (28%, for 176 transcriptional units) and 89 sites (12%, for 81 transcriptional units) were possibly involved in transcriptional activation and repression, respectively. In this study, we termed these 304 sites as ‘apparently relevant’ sites. Although we demonstrated that AdpA represses transcription of its own gene,16 it was unexpected that AdpA appears to repress more than 80 other transcriptional units (see Discussion). The in vivo binding of AdpA to the remaining 469 ‘putative regulatory region’ sites seemed not to affect gene expression, at least under the growth conditions examined. We termed these 469 sites as ‘apparently irrelevant’ sites.We then compared the distribution of ChIP/ChAP-seq signal intensities (average values), which reflects the strength of AdpA–DNA interaction in vivo, between apparently relevant and irrelevant sites (Fig. 4). No significant difference was observed between them. Furthermore, there was no significant difference in distribution of ChIP/ChAP-seq signal intensities among the three positional classifications of AdpA-binding sites (‘putative regulatory’, ‘coding’, and ‘intergenic’ regions) (Fig. 4). These results indicated that in vivo AdpA-binding strength is not related to the functional significance of particular AdpA-binding sites.

The means of peak signals derived from ChIP-seq and ChAP-seq are plotted. Box plots are also shown. In the box plot, the bottom and top of the box are the 25th and 75th percentile (the lower and upper quartiles), respectively, and the band near the middle of the box is the 50th percentile (the median). The ends of the whiskers represent the lowest datum still within 1.5 IQR of the lower quartile, and the highest datum still within 1.5 IQR of the upper quartile (IQR, inter-quartile range, is equal to the difference between the upper and lower quartiles).In vivo AdpA-binding strength is not related to the functional significance of particular AdpA-binding sites.

Confirmation of in vitro AdpAbinding to the in vivo AdpA-binding sites detected by ChIP/ChAP-seqWe examined whether the AdpA-C-His protein purified from Escherichia coli binds to the in vivo AdpA-binding sites by comprehensive competitive EMSA. We tested all 304 ‘apparently relevant’ AdpA-binding sites. ChIP/ChAP-seq signal peaks were detected within 50 bp from all of the ‘category-I’ AdpA-binding sites, except AdBS-sgiA; therefore, 130–200 bp DNA fragments containing a centrally positioned predicted AdpA-binding site (ChIP/ChAP-seq peak) were amplified by PCR. These DNA fragments were used as the competitors in EMSA using AdpA-C-His. In the competitive EMSA, we used two DIG-labelled probes with different AdpA-binding affinities: the high-affinity sgmA probe and the low-affinity sgiA probe.5 We detected 247 DNA fragments that at the least competed with the sgiA probe; however, 57 DNA fragments did not. AdpA frequently shows relatively low DNA-binding strength to short DNA fragments6 and true AdpA-binding sites may be separated from the ChIP/ChAP signal peaks by more than 50 bp in some cases; we increased the lengths of these 57 AdpA-unbound DNA fragments to 200–250 bp and re-examined their AdpA binding by competitive EMSA. As a result, we detected 37 DNA fragments that at least competed with the sgiA probe, but the remaining 20 DNA fragments did not. We identified at least one sequence that is similar to the AdpA-binding consensus sequence on each of the 284 DNA fragments to which AdpA bound in vitro. We regarded the consensus-like sequences as probable AdpA-binding sequences. When more than two possible AdpA-binding sequences existed in a DNA fragment, we selected the sequence closest to the ChIP/ChAP-seq signal peak in this study. In summary, of 304 ‘apparently relevant’ in vivo AdpA-binding sites, 284 sites (93%) were confirmed to be bound by AdpA in vitro. The remaining 20 AdpA-binding sites may not have resulted from false-positive signals, because the peaks were detected similarly by both ChIP-seq and ChAP-seq analyses, and because there was an AdpA-binding consensus-like sequence around each peak. It is possible that AdpA binds to these sites cooperatively with some other DNA-binding protein in vivo (see Discussion).3.5. Comparison of the strength of the AdpA–DNA interaction between in vivo and in vitroWe next determined whether there was a correlation in the strength of the AdpA–DNA interaction between in vivo and in vitro for the 304 ‘apparently relevant’ AdpA-binding sites. To roughly evaluate in vitro AdpA-binding strength, we rated the binding strength of AdpA to each DNA fragment in six ranks (rank ‘0’ to ‘5’) as described previously.5 Briefly, the strength of the AdpA–DNA interaction in vitro was assessed by competitive EMSA using two DIG-labelled probes with different AdpA-binding affinities. In vitro AdpA-binding strength is often underestimated when an AdpA-binding sequence is located at the end of the DNA fragment.6 Therefore, we selected 115 AdpA-binding sequences, which were located within 30 bp from the centre of each DNA fragment (130–200 bp), and compared in vitro AdpA-binding strength to in vivo AdpA-binding strength deduced from ChIP/ChAP-seq signal intensities (average values) (Fig. 5). Contrary to our expectation, there was very poor correlation of AdpA-binding strength between in vitro and in vivo conditions (correlation coefficient was 0.43). However, the sequences that were strongly bound by AdpA in vitro (those classified into ranks ‘5’ and ‘4’) generally showed relatively high in vivo AdpA-binding strength. Comparison of the strength of the AdpA–DNA interaction in vivo and in vitro. AdpA binding to 115 regions are examined (see text). One-dimensional scatter plots of in vivo AdpA-binding strength are shown for six respective ranks of in vitro AdpA-binding strength. Box plots (see the legend for Fig. 4) are also shown.Comparison of the strength of the AdpA–DNA interaction in vivo and in vitro. AdpA binding to 115 regions are examined (see text). One-dimensional scatter plots of in vivo AdpA-binding strength are shown for six respective ranks of in vitro AdpA-binding strength. Box plots (see the legend for Fig. 4) are also shown.Next, we calculated the ‘match score’ of these 115 AdpA-binding sequences to the consensus AdpA-binding sequence by Mast17 and examined a relationship between the match score (which represented the degree of similarity to the AdpA-binding consensus sequence) and AdpA-binding strength. There was almost no correlation between the match score and in vivo AdpA-binding strength (correlation coefficient was 0.23) (Supplementary Fig. S4A). However, the sequences that were strongly bound by AdpA in vivo tended to show relatively high match scores. There was also a very poor correlation between the match score and in vitro AdpA-binding strength (correlation coefficient was 0.36), but the sequences that were strongly bound by AdpA in vitro (especially those classified into ranks ‘5’ and ‘4’) showed relatively high match scores (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Note that AdpA binds DNA in two different ways. Type I binding occurs when both subunits of the AdpA dimer bind each of the two divergent AdpA-binding sequences and type II, where only one subunit binds a single AdpA-binding sequence to anchor the AdpA dimer. However, we did not consider any possible type-I AdpA binding in the analyses described above; only single AdpA-binding consensus-like sequences found in each AdpA-binding region were used for the analyses (see Discussion). Among the 115 AdpA-binding sequences, there were six kinds of duplicate sequences and four kinds of triplicate sequences. For example, the AdpA-binding sequences 5'-TGGCCGAAAA-3' and 5'-TGTCCGAAAA-3' were found in two and three different AdpA-binding sites, respectively. Interestingly, in 7 of the 10 cases, in vitro AdpA-binding strength significantly differed between two (or three) DNA fragments containing an identical AdpA-binding sequence (Supplementary Table S2). This result indicated that not only the 10 nucleotides of the AdpA-binding consensus sequence, but also the neighbouring nucleotide sequences affect the AdpA-binding strength in vitro (see Discussion).2,73.6. In vivo AdpA-binding profiles on solid cultureOur previous DNA microarray analysis showed that S. griseus had significantly different gene expression profiles between liquid and solid cultures (unpublished data). There had also been a suggestion that there should be a large difference in the genes regulated by AdpA between liquid and solid cultures (unpublished data). Therefore, we were interested in the in vivo difference in the AdpA-binding profiles between liquid and solid cultures.First, we compared the transcriptomes using a DNA microarray between the N-His-AdpA-producing <U+0394>adpA strain and the control <U+0394>adpA strain containing the empty vector pTYM19. RNA was extracted from both strains grown on YMPD agar at 28°C for 1–3 days. In this culture, the N-His-AdpA-producing <U+0394>adpA strain grew as substrate mycelium at day 1, as substrate mycelium plus aerial mycelium at day 2, and as substrate mycelium plus aerial mycelium with spores at day 3. The control <U+0394>adpA strain could not make aerial mycelium and spores throughout culture. At day 1, 531 and 457 genes were expressed at higher and lower levels, respectively, in the N-His-AdpA-producing strain when compared with the control <U+0394>adpA strain (fold change =2 and =0.5, respectively, and P-value <0.05). This indicated that 531 and 457 genes were activated and repressed, respectively, by AdpA (directly or indirectly) at day 1. Similarly, the numbers of apparently AdpA-activated and repressed genes were 509 and 394 (at day 2), and 611 and 606 (at day 3), respectively. The mycelium at day 1 on solid culture should roughly correspond to the mycelium of 18-h liquid culture, in that both mycelia were in the late exponential growth phase; therefore, we compared AdpA-regulated genes between the 18-h liquid culture and 1-day solid culture. When genes whose transcriptional data were statistically available in both the transcriptome analyses were compared, only 281 genes were apparently activated by AdpA in both liquid and solid cultures, while 437 and 202 genes were activated specifically in liquid and solid cultures, respectively (Fig. 6A). On the other hand, only 100 genes were apparently repressed by AdpA in both liquid and solid cultures, while 348 and 264 genes were specifically repressed in liquid and solid cultures, respectively (Fig. 6A). Thus, we confirmed that there was indeed a large difference in the genes regulated by AdpA between liquid and solid cultures.

(B) Numbers of AdpA-binding sites in ‘putative regulatory regions’.The AdpA-binding profiles at days 1, 2, and 3 were then examined by ChAP-seq. Similar to the ChIP/ChAP-seq analysis in liquid culture, the signal intensity of AdBS-adsA was used as a threshold to exclude background noise. Contrary to our expectation, the AdpA-binding profiles did not change significantly among 18-h liquid culture and 1-, 2-, and 3-day solid cultures (Table 1). When in vivo AdpA-binding sites on ‘putative regulatory regions’ were compared between 18-h liquid culture and 1-day solid culture, 728 sites were shared, and 201 and 66 sites were specifically detected in the liquid and solid cultures, respectively (Fig. 6B). Interestingly, many of these specifically detected sites have relatively low ChIP-seq and/or ChAP-seq signal intensities. Transcriptome analysis indicated that only 3 of the 201 sites specifically detected in the liquid culture were apparently involved in gene regulation (Supplementary Fig. S5). In other words, only three liquid culture-specific AdpA-binding sites were ‘apparently relevant’. Similarly, only 3 of the 66 solid culture-specific sites were ‘apparently relevant’ (Supplementary Fig. S5). Biological significance of the liquid or solid culture-specific regulation of these genes by AdpA is unknown. However, from these results, we concluded that the large difference in the genes regulated by AdpA between liquid and solid cultures resulted from regulatory elements other than AdpA binding; AdpA-binding profiles did not change significantly between cultures.3.7. Extraction of putative AdpA-target genesChAP-seq and transcriptome analyses in solid culture suggested 150 new ‘apparently relevant’ AdpA-binding sites in addition to the 304 sites described above. In total, of 1001 in vivo AdpA-binding sites on ‘putative regulatory region’ of protein-coding genes in liquid and/or solid cultures, we identified 262 sites (26%, for 217 transcriptional units, 342 genes) and 172 sites (17%, for 156 transcriptional units, 224 genes) that were apparently involved in transcriptional activation and repression, respectively, in either liquid or solid culture. In addition, 20 AdpA-binding sites that apparently had contradictory effects on gene regulation among 18-h liquid culture and 1-, 2-, and 3-day solid cultures were detected (e.g. SGR4671 was apparently activated in 18-h liquid culture by AdpA and repressed in 2- and 3-day solid culture). These sites were excluded from the following lists (Tables 2 and 3; Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). We then catalogued candidates for direct target genes of AdpA. AdpA presumably activates the promoters of 88 transcriptional units containing 145 genes in both liquid and solid cultures, which include 7 ‘category-I’ AdpA-target promoters (adsA, amfR, strR, sprB, sgmA, AdBS2-orf1, and AdBS4-orf1) and 20 probable AdpA-target promoters suggested by Hara et al.5 and/or Akanuma et al.6 (Table 2; Supplementary Table S3). In accordance with the proposed function of AdpA, these AdpA-target genes included many genes probably involved in secondary metabolism and morphological differentiation. On the other hand, AdpA presumably represses 40 transcriptional units containing 54 genes in both liquid and solid cultures (Table 3). We also listed 54 AdpA-target transcriptional units (79 genes) that are activated specifically on solid culture (Supplementary Table S4). They included four ‘category-I’ AdpA-target genes (ssgA, sprU, sprT, and AdBS3-orfA) and four known candidates for AdpA-target transcriptional units5,6; however, many of them (56%) were categorized as function-unknown genes. Note that we estimated transcriptional units from transcriptome data, gene synteny, and functional relationship with its neighbouring genes.

However, in vivo AdpA binding to their ‘category-I’ AdpA-binding sites was detected. In contrast, the DNA microarray analysis showed that the ‘category-I’ AdpA-target gene sgiA4 was activated by AdpA, but AdpA binding to its AdpA-binding site in vivo was not detected by ChIP/ChAP-seq analysis for an unknown reason. It should be noted that the sgiA locus has been suggested to have some high-order DNA structure. The putative high-order DNA structure of the sgiA locus may hamper the efficiency of ChIP/ChAP with N-His-AdpA. In summary, of the 14 ‘category-I’ AdpA-target transcriptional units, only 3 units were dropped from the candidate lists. Therefore, a majority of AdpA-target genes were listed in this study.4. DiscussionIn this study, ChIP/ChAP-seq technology was used to take snapshots of distribution of AdpA across the chromosome in living S. griseus cells. In combination with transcriptome analysis, the results indicated that AdpA directly controls >500 genes; AdpA regulon seems to be more extensive than previously suggested. Genes that are likely to be under the direct control of AdpA were also extensively catalogued (Tables 2 and 3; Supplementary Tables S3 and S4), which should contribute to future studies of the regulation of secondary metabolism and morphological differentiation in S. griseus. In fact, bldA was identified as an AdpA-target gene by this study, revealing a unique positive feedback loop between two global regulators, AdpA and BldA, in S. griseus.13 In addition to the identification of AdpA regulon, certain unique characteristics of AdpA regulation were revealed, as discussed separately below.4.1. Numbers of in vivo AdpA-binding sites and transcriptional units belonging to the AdpA regulonAlthough the AdpA-binding consensus sequence (5'-TGGCSNGWWY-3') has four alternative nucleotides and one free nucleotide, the ‘category-I’ AdpA-binding sites usually contain a few inconsistent nucleotides within the consensus sequence. Thus, the DNA-binding specificity of AdpA is much lower than that of other well-known regulators in bacteria. ChIP/ChAP analysis of 18-h liquid culture and ChAP analysis of 1-, 2-, and 3-day solid cultures indicated ~1500 AdpA-binding sites. Approximately 35% of them were located on regions that appeared not to affect transcription (i.e. ‘coding’ and ‘intergenic’ regions). Furthermore, transcriptome analysis indicated that ~60% of the AdpA-binding sites in ‘putative regulatory regions’ should not affect transcription. Taken together, ~75% of the in vivo AdpA-binding sites seemed not to be involved in gene regulation, and only ~25% of them were ‘apparently relevant’. We found 262 and 172 AdpA-binding sites that are apparently involved in transcriptional activation (217 transcriptional units, 342 genes) and repression (156 transcriptional units, 224 genes), respectively, in either liquid or solid culture. To confirm the AdpA dependency of these transcriptional units, the effect of mutation of AdpA-binding sites on transcription of each of the putative target genes should be examined. We previously revealed that the bldK operon is indirectly activated by AdpA, in spite of AdpA binding to the upstream region of bldK.18 Therefore, it is possible that some of the putative AdpA-dependent transcriptional units described above are actually regulated indirectly by AdpA (see the legend for Supplementary Table S3). It is also possible that many of them are directly regulated by AdpA, like the ‘category-I’ AdpA-target genes.Recently, den Hengst et al.19 used ChIP-chip technology to identify in vivo binding regions of BldD, which is a global transcriptional repressor for both morphological differentiation and secondary metabolism in Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). They identified 167 putative BldD-binding sites across the chromosome. Transcriptome analysis with a bldD mutant and its parent strain confirmed that at least 29 of the 167 BldD-binding sites were relevant. Similarly, Molle et al.10 identified 54 transcriptional units (121 genes) that are under the direct control of Spo0A, the master regulator for entry into sporulation in Bacillus subtilis. Our current study revealed that AdpA directly controls many more genes than these global transcriptional regulators for bacterial differentiation. To the best of our knowledge, the AdpA regulon seems to be the largest one in bacteria.4.2. The strength of the AdpA–DNA interaction is not related to the biological significance of AdpA-binding sitesApproximately 75% of the in vivo AdpA-binding sites apparently have no function in the regulation of gene expression. Similar results have been observed for E. coli RutR,20Bacillus subtilis AbrB,21 and Streptomyces coelicolor BldD;19 binding of them to most of their in vivo binding sites did not apparently affect gene expression. We speculate that AdpA binding to such regions has no or little biological significance. ChIP-chip analysis by Grainger et al.22 revealed that CRP in E. coli bound to 68 high-affinity sites, including 29 known CRP-dependent promoter regions, and interacted with thousands of weaker sites across the chromosome. They suggested that CRP should be considered as a chromosome-shaping protein contributing to the compaction of the chromosome (because DNA-bound CRP bends its target sharply), in addition to its function as a promoter-specific regulator. We cannot exclude the possibility that AdpA also functions as a chromosome-shaping protein in S. griseus. However, a striking difference between the DNA-binding profiles of CRP and AdpA concerns their DNA-binding strengths. As described above, CRP binds strongly to its target promoter regions and interacts weakly with ‘background’ regions. In contrast, AdpA binds with a similar strength to ‘apparently irrelevant’ regions similarly to ‘apparently relevant’ regions. Thus, the strength of the AdpA–DNA interaction is not related to the functional significance of particular AdpA-binding sites. The broad range of DNA-binding strengths to a variety of genuine target promoter regions, as well as ‘apparently irrelevant’ regions, is one of the distinctive properties of AdpA. We hypothesize that the position of the AdpA-binding site relative to the transcriptional start point, rather than the binding strength, is important for transcriptional regulation by AdpA. In fact, our previous studies have shown that AdpA activates 10 of 14 ‘category-I’ AdpA-target genes by binding to –50 to –70 regions in respect to their transcriptional start points.4.3. Complexity of the DNA-binding properties of AdpARegarding the selected 115 probable AdpA-binding sequences, we showed poor correlation of AdpA-binding strength between in vitro and in vivo conditions, while the sequences that were strongly bound by AdpA in vitro generally showed relatively high AdpA-binding strength in vivo. Furthermore, of the 304 in vivo AdpA-binding regions examined, 20 regions (6.6%) were not bound by AdpA in vitro, although they contain AdpA-binding consensus-like sequences. The ChIP-chip analyses of several bacterial global regulators, such as CtrA in Caulobacter crescentus23 and LexA and FNR in E. coli,24,25 have indicated that these regulators bind dozens of ‘non-canonical’ sites in vivo, which are not similar to their consensus binding sequences. Interestingly, these unconventional targets were not bound by the respective regulators in vitro. Wade et al.24 suggested that binding of LexA to these unconventional targets requires additional factors, such as cooperative interaction with other proteins and/or unusual DNA conformation (e.g. bent or supercoiled DNA). Thus, AdpA may also require similar additional factors to bind some of the AdpA-binding sites detected by ChIP/ChAP-seq. Such additional factors may explain the poor correlation of AdpA-binding strength between in vitro and in vivo conditions. We postulated that AdpA might frequently interact with other DNA-binding proteins to regulate target genes. This assumption is also supported by the observation that the expression profiles of apparently AdpA-dependent genes were very different between liquid and solid cultures, despite the similar AdpA-binding profiles in both cultures. Thus, in vivo, AdpA seems to exert its regulatory functions cooperatively with other proteins in many cases. Detailed analysis of cooperative regulation between AdpA and other regulatory proteins will form a very important part of our future studies.Importantly, the degree of similarity to the AdpA-binding consensus sequence was not necessarily consistent with the strength of the AdpA–DNA interaction of each AdpA-binding site (both in vivo and in vitro), although the sequences that were strongly bound by AdpA in vitro showed a relatively high similarity to the consensus sequence. This is a striking contrast to the binding mode of LexA to its conventional targets, in which the strength of the LexA–DNA interaction can be well approximated by the degree of similarity to the LexA-binding consensus sequence.24 However, there are analytical limitations that should be taken into consideration, as well as our incomplete understanding of the molecular mechanism of DNA recognition by AdpA. First, in this analysis, type-I AdpA binding, in which both subunits of the AdpA dimer bind each of the two divergent AdpA-binding sequences, was not considered, because we could not conclusively identify type-I-binding sites without DNase I footprinting. When AdpA binds to a type-I site, another AdpA-binding sequence in the vicinity should affect the strength of the AdpA–DNA interaction. Therefore, regarding genuine type-I sites, we could not correctly estimate the relationship between the strength of the AdpA–DNA interaction and the degree of similarity to the consensus sequence. Secondly, it is possible that some DNA fragments used for the competitive EMSA had two (or more) AdpA-binding sites. Our ChIP/ChAP-seq analysis clearly detected two peaks that are separated by 200 bp in the upstream region of sgmA (Fig. 2B). However, we failed to discriminate two AdpA-binding sites13 that are separated by 50 bp in the upstream region of bldA (data not shown). When AdpA binds to two (or more) sites in a DNA fragment, it may lead to overestimation of the binding strength of the identified AdpA-binding sequence. Finally, in some cases, the additional eight nucleotides 3' to the consensus sequence may contribute to the DNA-binding strength more significantly than expected. AdpA, which belongs to the AraC/XylS family, has two helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motifs. Based on the DNA-binding characteristics of some AraC/XylS family regulators, such as AraC, XylS, and SoxS, we proposed that the helix-turn-helix at the N-terminal side (HTH-1) recognizes the relatively highly conserved TGGCS sequence at the 5'-end of the consensus sequence.2 The other helix-turn-helix at the C-terminal side (HTH-2) recognizes the other nucleotides in the consensus sequence with the next eight nucleotides.2 Although nucleotide recognition by HTH-2 seems to be less important than that by HTH-1, it may significantly affect the binding strength in some cases.4.4. AdpA as a transcriptional repressorIt was unexpected that AdpA could directly repress more than 100 transcriptional units in ether liquid or solid culture. Our previous study indicated that AdpA represses transcription of its own gene by binding to three sites in the 5' upstream region of adpA, probably forming a loop structure of the DNA.16 However, ChIP/ChAP-seq analysis detected only one AdpA-binding site in the ‘putative regulatory region’ of most (>90%) of the transcriptional units that were apparently repressed by AdpA. In such cases, AdpA may bind to the -35 and/or -10 sequences to hamper RNA polymerase from binding to them to initiate transcription. Interestingly, several genes that are presumably involved in primary metabolism are included in the list of possible genes directly repressed by AdpA in both liquid and solid cultures (Table 3). To reveal a new aspect of global gene regulation by AdpA, further detailed analyses of the repressor function of AdpA is necessary.4.5. Biological significance of the low DNA-binding specificity of AdpAAlthough bacterial genomes are packaged by histone-like proteins into a nucleoid structure, this structure is not analogous to eukaryotic chromatin; bacterial genomes are permissive to transcription factor binding.21,22,24 Wade et al.24 proposed that bacteria must evolve transcription factors with high DNA-binding specificity because of equal accessibility of the genomes. However, this is obviously not applicable to AdpA; the DNA-binding specificity of AdpA is very low, and AdpA can bind to >1500 sites (including many ‘apparently irrelevant’ sites) across the chromosome. AdpA orthologues are highly conserved (more than 90% amino acid similarity) among many Streptomyces species, and their essential roles in morphological differentiation and/or secondary metabolism have been revealed in various Streptomyces strains.13 Surprisingly, the two helix-turn-helix DNA-binding motifs are completely identical among these proteins, indicating that they have the same DNA-binding specificity. Thus, the low DNA-binding specificity of AdpA has been maintained during evolution, suggesting that this atypical characteristic of AdpA as a bacterial transcription factor should be very important for the biology of Streptomyces. There could be some advantages conferred by the low DNA-binding specificity of AdpA for Streptomyces. First, the low DNA-binding specificity of AdpA enables binding to many sites on the chromosome, which facilitates regulation of many genes. For transition from vegetative growth to reproductive (differentiating) growth, including secondary metabolite production, a drastic change of gene expression is undoubtedly necessary. Therefore, the low DNA-binding specificity seems to be advantageous to AdpA as a pivotal regulator for this process. Secondly, the low DNA-binding specificity of AdpA may generate evolutional flexibility of the regulatory network. It is thought that Streptomyces achieves the productivity of a wide variety of secondary metabolites by acquiring foreign biosynthetic enzyme genes through horizontal gene transfer.26 The low DNA-binding specificity of AdpA may increase the occurrence of an AdpA-binding site(s) in the regulatory region of newly acquired genes, which may increase the chance that AdpA regulates them. Thus, the low DNA-binding specificity of AdpA may enable frequent reconstruction of local gene regulation. This may be advantageous to the evolution of Streptomyces.4.6. The A-factor regulatory system in Streptomyces griseusStreptomyces griseus seems to have evolved the highly integrated A-factor regulatory cascade, and the function of AdpA as a global regulator for morphological differentiation and secondary metabolism may be much more significant in S. griseus compared with other Streptomyces species. In the A-factor regulatory system, the hormonal signal triggers the production of only one transcriptional regulator, AdpA, which directly regulates the transcription of more than 500 genes. This ‘highly converged’ regulatory system seems to represent an example of sophisticated global gene regulation in bacteria. This system has the advantage of being able to switch the expression profiles of many genes in a relatively short period. We think that this system may reflect a fundamental aspect of differentiation of Streptomyces.We thank N.

IntroductionThe Korean Jindo Dog (Jindotgae in Korean) is a breed of hunting dog that originated on Jindo Island in South Korea. The Jindo dog breed was recognized by the United Kennel Club on 1 January 1998 and by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale in 2005, and, owing to its fierce loyalty to humans and brave nature, it has spread far beyond the Korean peninsula. The Jindo dog has notably acute hearing and scenting ability, a medium-sized body, erect ears and a sickle-shaped tail.The genome of the domestic dog is of great interest not only to biologists and animal breeders but also to medical scientists. Dogs and humans share many highly prevalent diseases, including cancers, epilepsy, cataracts, diabetes, blindness, heart disease, hip dysplasia and deafness,1,2 and the clinical manifestations of these diseases in the two species are often similar.3 Understanding the genetic bases of behavioural traits and morphological variations4 in physical characteristics, such as size, skull shape and coat colour and texture in domestic dogs, could help animal breeders to breed dogs that are better suited to human requirements. In addition, correctly positioning the dog within the mammalian evolutionary tree will provide important insight into the human genome.5Pioneering genome sequencing projects5,6 using the traditional Sanger method to sequence the boxer and poodle genomes shed the first light on the dog genome sequence and structure, genetic evolution, haplotype structure, linkage disequilibrium patterns, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) map and evolutionary phylogeny.7 Along with major advances in canine genomics, great progress was made in identifying the olfactory receptor genes8–11 that are associated with dogs' excellent smell-discriminating ability. Dog mitochondrial genome data were also used in these studies12–14 to provide insight into the phylogenetic origins of diverse kinds of dog breeds.Despite these achievements in the fields of dog genomics and genetics, there are still issues that remain to be resolved before the sequencing and annotation of the dog genome can be considered complete. In contrast to the cell-free system used with next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques, the in vivo cloning steps used with the Sanger method of whole-genome shot-gun sequencing could result in gap regions.15 In addition, the coverage generated by the Sanger method is low (7.5-fold for the boxer genome5 and 1.5-fold for the poodle genome)6 owing to the high cost of this method, which could prevent dog population-level genome sequencing. Recently, next-generation massively parallel sequencing platforms, including the Illumina Genome Analyser, the Roche 454 Genome Sequencer FLX Instrument and the ABI SOLiD System, have revolutionized the genome sequencing process by providing high through-put, high speed and cost-effective high coverage.15–18In this study, we applied the next-generation massively parallel sequencing technique (Illumina HiSeq 2000) to the sequencing and analysis of a dog genome for the first time. We generated 45-fold coverage sequence data, performed complete sequence annotation of the Jindo dog mitochondrial genome and provided deep insight into the SNP map, gap regions in the reference boxer genome, the olfactory gene family responsible for a dog's ability to smell and evolutionary phylogeny.2. Materials and methods2.1. DNA extraction, library preparation and Illumina massively parallel sequencing platformGenomic DNA was isolated from blood cells collected from a male Korean Jindo dog using a QIAGEN genomic DNA isolation kit. DNA sample preparation kits were used to prepare DNA libraries with template insert sizes of 300–400 bp for single and paired-end sequencing (Illumina® sequencing manual). All data were generated on an Illumina HiSeq2000 using sequencing protocols provided by the manufacturer.2.2. Alignment of short reads onto the reference boxer genomeAfter filtering the artificial reads from the total collection of short reads, we aligned a clean, usable read set to the reference boxer genome (canFam2) using a fast short-read alignment program, BWA (ver. 0.5.9), with the default parameters. This program efficiently uses the information obtained from paired-end reads to correct alignments and accurately map short reads to repetitive sequences.192.3. SNP identificationThe short reads were aligned to the reference boxer genome by the BWA program under conditions that allowed two-base pair mismatches for the detection of SNPs. We then performed statistical calculations based on Samtools and the Illumina quality system to judge whether a mismatched base was an error or an SNP. The utilized criteria were as follows: minimum read depth of four (-d 4), maximum depth of 100 (-D 100) to filter out randomly placed repetitive hits, consensus quality score =20 or error rate <1% (Q20), adjacent sequence quality (Q20) and no indel within a 3-bp flanking region. The filter criteria used here included a Q20 quality cut-off, estimated copy number of flanking sequences (<2), minimum distance between any two SNPs (=5 bp) and overall depth (=100) at a given position in the reference. For the homozygous SNPs, at least four reads should be observed. For the heterozygous SNPs, each allele should be supported by at least four reads.2.4. Detection of small indelsWe identified small indels using indel detection methods based on the information generated from paired-end reads (BWA and Samtools). We used standard criteria stating that each indel should be confirmed by a minimum of three reads and that it should also be observed in both strands. Multiple indels occurring within a 20-bp window were filtered out from the BWA results because closely spaced indels can be caused by alignment errors.2.5. Detection of structural variantsWe detected structural variants (SVs) by using information about the span size and orientation of each paired-end read. Unusually long or short distances (more than twice the median insert size of each DNA library or much less than that) between two paired-end reads were identified as harbouring SVs only when they were clustered with a read depth of more than two. We also dismissed cases where clusters of such paired-end reads were present in repeat regions of the genome. Finally, genomic deletions with a size of >10 kb were filtered out.2.6. Data sourcesThe NCBI dog reference genome, NCBI reference gene information and dbSNP (ver. CanFam2.0) were obtained from the Ensembl database (http://www.ensembl.org/), which provides information about genes mapped onto the NCBI build 2.2.7. SNP annotationSNPs in the Jindo dog genome were compared with ENSEMBL dbSNP (ver. CanFam2.0) to distinguish between known and novel SNPs after using BWA to identify SNPs that were confirmed by more than four reads. Each SNP was mapped onto the regions corresponding to the genomic features of the NCBI gene structure, such as introns, UTRs and coding sequences (CDS). Information about non-synonymous SNPs was extracted by comparison with the NCBI reference gene information.2.8. Mitochondrial genome assemblyAll reads corresponding to the Jindo dog mitochondrial genome sequence were searched using Bowtie, and we found a total of 234 817 such reads. The number of mitochondrial genome reads was reduced to 217 988 at the error correction stage. The reads were assembled using SOAPdenovo, generating 43 large contigs (>200 bp in size).2.9. Data accessThe whole-genome sequencing short-read data for the Korean Jindo dog have been deposited in the DDBJ under the accession number DRA000473.3. Results3.1. Massively parallel sequencing of the Jindo dog genomeGenomic DNA was isolated from blood samples collected from a male Korean Jindo dog. Using the Illumina HiSeq2000 platform, we performed massively parallel sequencing, generating 1 102 978 656 high-quality reads with an average read length of 100 bp (Table 1). Of these reads, 1 090 271 942 (98.84%) were mapped to the reference boxer genome5 by a fast short-read alignment program, BWA19 (version 0.5.9; see Section 2). The total number of sequenced nucleotides was 110.2 Gb, corresponding to an average depth coverage of 45-fold over the reference boxer genome (estimated genome size: 2.445 Gb). The proportion of the regions in which our mapped reads were matched to the reference boxer genome corresponded to 94.02% of the genome. The relationship between the short-read depth coverage and the GC content throughout the whole dog genome shows that our Illumina short reads cover regions in the Jindo dog genome corresponding to nearly entire GC content range, and especially, the read depth coverage ranges from 15- to 47-fold in the genomic regions with the GC contents ranging from 11 to 77% (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B). These results suggest that massively parallel sequencing using the Illumina HiSeq 2000 platform is very cost-effective and accurate for the generation of high-quality reads. Summary of the Jindo dog genome sequencing resultsSummary of the Jindo dog genome sequencing results3.2. Single nucleotide polymorphismsBased on the standard criteria that each homozygous SNP must be corroborated by at least four reads, and every heterozygous SNP must be supported by at least four reads for each corresponding allele, we identified SNPs and corrected errors (see Section 2) in the sequence read data. Given that a previous study15 showed that the existence of two short reads for each SNP site, together with SNP error correction, can guarantee an accuracy of 99% of identified SNPs in the case of genome read data with a 13-fold average coverage, our criteria should enable almost perfect accuracy in the identification of SNPs in Jindo dog genome short-read data with an average depth coverage of 45-fold. We detected a total of 4 675 437 SNPs, of which 1 976 029 and 2 699 408 corresponded to homozygous and heterozygous SNPs, respectively (Fig. 1A). Compared with the reference boxer genome, the Jindo dog genome showed 3 346 058 novel and 1 329 379 shared SNPs (Fig. 1B). We also determined that 1065 Jindo dog SNPs were located within intragenic regions, of which 46 (in 35 genes), 812 (in 503 genes) and 207 (in 133 genes) were positioned within the 5'untranslated region (UTR), CDS and 3'UTR, respectively (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Table S1).

(C) Intragenic SNPs in the Jindo dog genome.Importantly, of the 812 CDS SNPs, 339 (in 222 genes) were non-synonymous. We used the NCBI OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) database to identify which of the 339 non-synonymous CDS SNPs are located within genes that are associated with known disease phenotypes. We confirmed that 89 of the 222 genes have been reported to be associated with diseases in humans, dogs and other species (mice, rats, drosophila, zebra fish, rabbits and cattle; Supplementary Table S2). Notably, a majority of the genes (58 genes) were associated with disease phenotypes that are known to be shared by humans and other species. In particular, 18 of the 58 genes were associated with mutational phenotypes shared mainly between humans and dogs (Table 2). Of these 18 genes, TCOF120 (OMIM accession: 606847, associated with Treacher Collins syndrome 1), HLA-DQB1 (OMIM accession: 604305, associated with Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease), AMN (OMIM accession: 605799, associated with megaloblastic anaemia-1), COL4A5 (OMIM accession: 303630, associated with Alport syndrome), COL7A1 (OMIM accession: 120120, associated with EBD inversa), DBH (OMIM accession: 609312, associated with dopamine beta-hydroxylase deficiency) and GUSB (OMIM accession: 611499, associated with mucopolysaccharidosis VII) harbour more than one non-synonymous CDS SNP.

IndelsWe identified a total of 71 642 indels (insertion and deletion variations) present within the short-read sequences, of which 27 517 and 44 125 corresponded to homozygous and heterozygous indels, respectively (Fig. 2A). In particular, nine indels occurred within intragenic regions; three indels were present within the CDS regions of the genes KRT1 (a 3-bp insertion: GGC), TCOF1 (a 26-bp deletion: GGGCACCTGCAGCCTCACCTGAACAG, as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2D) and SET (a 9-bp deletion: GATGATGAT; Table 3). TCOF1 (OMIM accession: 606847) is known to be associated with the Treacher-Collins–Franceschetti syndrome in humans and dogs, and KRT1 (OMIM accession: 139350) is known to be associated with Curth–Macklin Palmoplantar keratoderma in humans.

We identified a total of 8131 structural variations (7780 deletions, 231 insertions and 120 inversions) in the Jindo genome relative to the boxer reference genome (Fig. 2B). Among the structural deletion variations (7780), 1086 and 6694 events were caused by non-retrotransposons and retrotransposons, respectively, and of the 6694 retrotransposon-induced deletion variations, 2068, 2033, 389, 242 and 1962 events were mediated by LINE, SINE, LTR and DNA elements and other retrotransposons, respectively (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. S3).Interestingly, our analysis of the SINE-mediated deletions is consistent with a recent study22 that reported that there are >10 000 loci that are bimorphic for the SINEs in the dog genome and that 3–5% of them could vary between dog breeds as a result of deletion or insertion. Such differences in the absence or presence of SINEs (especially within intragenic regions) between dog breeds appear to be significantly associated with breed-specific novel exon creation (owing to the donation of splice acceptor sites by SINEs).223.5. Identification of novel dog genome sequences corresponding to gap regions in the boxer reference genomeAnother important finding of this study was the discovery of novel dog genome sequences that correspond to the gap regions in the boxer breed reference genome. By performing de novo assembly of the 12 706 714 (1.15%) reads that were unmapped to the reference genome, we acquired 36 900 contigs and 25 805 scaffolds. We identified a significant match for 2517 (=300 bp in length) of these contigs in the NR (non-redundant) database using BlastN; 3855 (=300 bp in length) of these contigs did not have a match. Of the matched contigs, 734 (Supplementary Table S3) and 991 (Supplementary Table S4) had a match in the NR database (protein database) based on BlastX and in the expressed sequence tag (EST) database (human, mouse and others) based on BlastN, respectively. Of the unmatched contigs, 862 (Supplementary Table S5) and 42 (Supplementary Table S6) had a match in the NR (protein database) and EST databases, respectively. We matched 2438 (=300 bp in length) of the scaffolds to the NR database using BlastN, and 3792 scaffolds (=300 bp in length) were unmatched. Of these, 700 (matched; Supplementary Table S7) and 863 (unmatched; Supplementary Table S8) scaffolds were matched to the NR database (protein database), respectively, and 958 (matched; Supplementary Table S9) and 42 (unmatched; Supplementary Table S10) were matched to the EST database, respectively.During the painstaking and time-consuming manual annotation [in the UCSC boxer reference genome (Broad/CanFam2) browser] of each contig or scaffold (unmapped to the reference genome) showing a match to the EST and NR protein databases, we realized that the unmapped reads mainly corresponded to cDNA or EST sequences that could be classified into three groups.The first group includes EST sequences (dog, human and others) that span a known genomic region and a partial unknown sub-region within a gap region in the reference genome. Intriguingly, many unmapped scaffolds matched only to the parts (of the EST sequences) corresponding to the unknown sub-regions in the gaps, which explains why those reads and scaffolds could not be mapped to the reference genome. The many unmapped contigs and scaffolds that belonged to this first group included the contigs C64934 6.0 (corresponding gap location: chr9: 22362967–22363440), C72210 10.0 (chr25: 21595815–21596814), C61340 8.0 (chr1:5236 4890–52366081), C57026 6.0 (chr28:17167026 –17167309), C61208 6.0 (chr11:27745205–27745630) and C59020 6.0 (chr2:87164377–87165300) and the scaffolds 190 7.6 (chr26: 19087754–19088523) and 263 6.6 (chr1:383 95670–38396089). This paper is the first analysis of the dog genome using massively parallel next generation sequencing techniques, as opposed to the previously published boxer reference genome, which was based on cloning in bacterial cells, Sanger sequencing and whole genome shot-gun assembly. Similar to our results, the first human genome resequencing15 using NGS (next-generation sequencing) techniques added novel human genome sequences to the gaps in the reference human genome, which, at that time, was based on Sanger sequencing. In contrast to the cell-free system used with the NGS techniques, the traditional Sanger technique-based whole-genome sequencing method involves cloning steps in E. coli cells that are likely to cause the loss of sequence regions that are unsuited for in vivo cloning.15 Therefore, our Jindo dog short-read genome sequence data could make a significant contribution towards partially filling the gap regions in the reference boxer genome.The second group of reads includes dog EST and cDNA sequences, the genomic locations of which are unknown at present. In addition, the third group consists of EST and cDNA sequences (from humans, bears, mice and others) for which the homologous dog partners (ESTs and cDNAs) are absent from dog EST libraries and their genomic locations in the dog genome are still obscure. Thus, our unmapped contigs and scaffolds that belong to the second and third groups appear to correspond to the middle regions of large gaps, which are so long that a known EST sequence flanking a gap, if it exists, cannot cover the middle region.3.6. Olfactory receptor gene familyIn general, dogs have much keener olfactory abilities than humans, and the Korean Jindo dog is known to have a particularly acute olfactory sense. Previously, ~900 and 1094 olfactory receptor genes have been reported in humans and dogs, respectively, and 63% (567) and 20.3% (222) of the respective human and dog olfactory receptor gene repertoires have been annotated as pseudo genes, providing evidence that more functional genes are involved in the olfactory process in dogs than in humans.8,11,23Using the recently updated boxer olfactory receptor gene repertoire (1179 genes, including predicted and experimentally invalidated genes; http://genome.weizmann.ac.il/horde/organism/index/organism:Dog),24 we identified the corresponding olfactory receptor genes in our Jindo dog genome short-read data and analysed SNPs within their sequences. We detected a total of 2299 SNPs in those genes, of which 773 and 1526 are homozygous and heterozygous SNPs, respectively (Supplementary Tables S11 and S12). The 773 homozygous SNPs are located within 265 coding genes and 108 pseudo genes and the 1526 heterozygous SNPs are located within 369 coding genes and 152 pseudo genes. In the case of the heterozygous SNP-containing Jindo olfactory genes, their Jindo alleles with no SNP are also present in the boxer genome. Therefore, we focused on further analysis of the homozygous SNP-containing Jindo olfactory genes for which the genotypes are present only in the Jindo dog genome and not in the boxer genome. Such analysis showed that, of the homozygous SNP-containing Jindo olfactory receptor genes (373), 236 and 137 had non-synonymous (Supplementary Table S13) and synonymous SNPs, respectively. The existence of the non-synonymous, homozygous SNPs within the 236 Jindo olfactory genes and their absence from the corresponding genes in the boxer genome implies that the smelling capabilities of the Jindo and boxer dog breeds might be significantly different. This finding provides strong evidence of such differences from a new molecular level perspective and is consistent with the recent discovery25 that the domestication of dogs resulted in changes in dog brain morphologies, accompanied by the reorientation of olfactory lobes and bulbs and consequent changes in olfactory sensory abilities among diverse domesticated dog breeds.Another interesting result of this study is our discovery of two unique dog olfactory receptor genes (named cOR5AS1 and cOR14C36) in the Jindo breed dog genome. These receptors had not previously been reported. Importantly, the unique dog olfactory receptor gene cOR5AS1 has a single exon encoding a deduced amino acid sequence with seven transmemebrane domains, which is typical of the olfactory receptor proteins (Fig. 3A). Interestingly, using the UCSC Affymetrix exon array chip database track, we identified that the human predicted olfactory receptor gene OR5AS1, which had the highest sequence identity (90%) at the amino acid level to the unique dog gene cOR5AS1, was expressed at low levels in the human cerebellum, thyroid and other tissues (Fig. 3B). In addition, not only the nucleotide sequence of the cOR5AS1 gene was highly conserved among a variety of mammalian species, but also its amino acid sequence with the seven transmembrane domain regions showed high homology (human: 90%, chimpanzee: 88%, macaque: 89%, pig: 88%, mouse: 81% and rat: 82%) with orthologous protein sequences from humans, chimpanzees, macaques, pigs, mice and rats (Fig. 3C). These results imply that the protein encoded by this unique gene might be functionally involved in the olfactory process in humans and dogs and that its function could be evolutionarily preserved in mammalian species.26The unique olfactory receptor gene cOR5AS1. (A) The proteins encoded by the unique dog olfactory receptor gene and its human homologue are both membrane-embedded proteins with seven transmembrane domains. (B) The unique dog olfactory receptor gene and its human homologue, both of which consist of a single exon, are closely aligned in the UCSC genome browser.

(C) Sequence identities among protein sequences (homologous to the unique dog olfactory receptor) from seven species.The unique olfactory receptor gene cOR5AS1.

(C) Sequence identities among protein sequences (homologous to the unique dog olfactory receptor) from seven species.We found that the other unique dog olfactory gene discovered in this study, cOR14C36, is a pseudo gene harbouring stop codons in its CDS, unlike its human homolog (OR14C36), which has a CDS encoding a deduced amino acid sequence uninterrupted by any mid-stop codons. This finding suggests that the second unique olfactory receptor gene has been conserved evolutionarily between humans and dogs, but functionally degenerated in dog species during the evolutionary process. It remains to be seen whether the pseudo olfactory receptor genes corresponding to ~20% of all olfactory genes represent evolutionary remnants or wasteful rubbish in the dog genome or why these apparently useless genes are evolutionarily preserved in the human (54%), dog (20%), mouse (20%) and rat (19.5%) genomes. In light of the recent breakthrough discovery27 that there are huge regulatory interaction networks connecting pseudo genes and their homologous coding genes (via microRNAs) that are mediated by the MRE (microRNA response element), the so-called ‘Rosetta stone28 of a hidden RNA language’, now would be the time to reassess the real value of the olfactory pseudo genes.3.7. Mitochondrial genome sequence reveals Jindo dog-specific genotypesWe determined the mitochondrial genome sequence of the Jindo dog by performing de novo assembly of mitochondrial reads extracted from our sequence read data (see Section 2). The mitochondrial genome of the Jindo dog consists of 13 protein-coding genes, 22 tRNA genes and 2 rRNAs genes (16 and 12S; Fig. 4). The sequence length of the Jindo dog mitochondrial genome determined in this study was 16 100 bp, but we estimated that the correct length of this mitochondrial DNA genome could be ~16.7 kb because there might be a gap (corresponding to a deficiency in a control region between tRNAPro and tRNAPhe) spanning ~600 bp.29Annotation of the Jindo dog mitochondrial genome sequence. Red arrows and numbers indicate the base positions corresponding to the Jindo dog-specific SNPs in the mitochondrial genome sequence.Annotation of the Jindo dog mitochondrial genome sequence. Red arrows and numbers indicate the base positions corresponding to the Jindo dog-specific SNPs in the mitochondrial genome sequence.A comparative analysis of mitochondrial genomic DNA sequences from 80 dog breeds, including the Jindo dog, showed Jindo dog-specific genotypes at 9 sequence positions (Table 4). Of these nine positions, two were present in intergenic regions and the other seven in the COX2 and ND5 genes. This result suggests that these nine genotypes could be used as genetic markers for identification of the Jindo dog breed.

Phylogenetic analysis suggests that Jindo dog is a purebred dog breedTo elucidate the phylogenetic origin of the domesticated Jindo dog breed, we drew a phylogenetic tree using mitochondrial DNA sequences from the grey wolf and 80 dog breeds including the Jindo dog and the mtDNA sequence from a coyote as an out-group (Fig. 5). We determined that these dog breeds could be phylogenetically classified into five relatively large groups (A–E) and two small groups (F and G). Surprisingly, the Jindo dog breed did not belong to any of these groups, providing evidence that the Jindo dog breed could have a maternally unique phylogenetic history during the domestication processes from grey wolves to dogs. Moreover, the Sapsari dog breed,29 which also originated in Korea, is not grouped with the Jindo dog breed in our phylogenetic tree. This result indicates that the Jindo dog breed is an independent purebred that originated in Korea, separate from the Sapsari dog breed.

The letters A–F and G indicate the names of the groups to which each of the dog breeds belong phylogenetically.Our phylogenetic tree also shows that dog breeds and grey wolf are included together in a large group (E), but all of the dog breeds are clearly split from coyote, supporting the evidence that the grey wolf could be an ancestor of domesticated dogs.7,30,314. DiscussionOur analysis of the Jindo dog genome using Illumina massively parallel sequencing technology is, to our knowledge, the first application of next-generation sequencing techniques to a dog genome since the traditional Sanger method-based sequencing of the boxer and poodle genomes.We show that short reads derived from a cell-free system could partially cover the gap regions in the reference boxer genome sequence, which might not have been sequenced originally because of difficulty in in vivo cloning of these regions during the Sanger sequencing and assembly of the boxer genome. This finding strongly suggests that a significant portion of the remaining gaps in the reference genome could be partially or completely filled in the near future by the more cost-effective NGS read data (Illumina short reads and 454 reads).The establishment of a correct genome-wide SNP map is very important for distinguishing between dog breeds and between individual dogs with regard to disease susceptibility, haplotype, gene expression and allele types. Using the 45-fold coverage short-read data, we identified 3 346 058 novel SNPs in the Jindo genome compared with boxer SNPs that had previously been identified based on the 7.5-fold coverage reference genome data. In addition, based on the non-synonymous SNPs in the Jindo dog genome, we indicated the probabilities of differences in disease susceptibility among the Jindo, boxer and other dog breeds. This result demonstrates that the Illumina NGS technology can cost-effectively generate high fold coverage read data that can be aligned with most (94.02%) of the reference boxer genome regions, undoubtedly guaranteeing a much higher accuracy of SNP identification than the low-coverage (7.5) boxer genome data based on the traditional Sanger method.There is growing evidence32 that the synonymous SNPs located within CDS of the protein-coding genes cannot be considered as silent or insignificant with regard to genetic disease causing. The synonymous SNPs (sSNPs) within CDS can cause a change in codon usage that could result in a change in a ribosome movement speed during protein translation, subsequently causing mis-folding in protein conformation and consequently affecting protein function.32,33 The sSNPs within exonic spicing enhancer sequences in the coding sequences could also change splicing processes and consequently mRNA structures.32,34 In light of these previous studies, the 473 CDS sSNPs (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Table S1) identified in this study could not be ignorable targets in future researches.The in-depth annotation of the dog genome could have a significant impact on human and medical biology. More than 360 genetic diseases found in humans are known to also be found in dogs.2,3 This fact suggests that the dog is a suitable model animal for identifying the loci of human disease-associated genes and for studying the causative mechanisms of human diseases. Through the annotation of the Jindo dog short-read genome data, we identified unique olfactory receptor genes, SNPs located in olfactory receptor genes and CDS regions of genes that are associated with genetic diseases and morphological development and breed-specific Jindo SNP genotypes in the mitochondrial genome sequence. Such information could be valuable for genome-wide association studies aimed at locating disease genes and SNPs in the dog genome. In conclusion, our Jindo genome data help gain deeper insight into dog genome sequence, structure and architecture and comparative genomics.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis research was supported by grant 2009-0084206 from the Ministry of Education, Science and Technology (MEST) and grant KGM5411011 from KRIBB.Supplementary data"

IntroductionThe presence of organelle genomes in mitochondria and chloroplasts in plant cells is explained by the widely accepted endosymbiotic theory. According to this theory, mitochondria and chloroplasts originated from endosymbioses of a-proteobacteria-like and cyanobacteria-like bacteria, respectively.1,2 At the initial stage of such symbioses, the host cell would have evolved some mechanism to coordinate metabolism and proliferation of the endosymbionts to control their growth. Subsequently, a number of genes encoding proteins for organelle functions have been transferred to the nuclear genome, and the host cells have gained the ability to dominate most organelle processes by controlling the proteins involved. On the other hand, mitochondria and chloroplasts have retained the ability to undergo certain proliferation processes such as DNA replication and division. These processes require coordination of events, and thus, these organelles must control their own transcriptomes to some degree. However, the cycle-dependence of gene expression during proliferation and the relevant regulatory mechanisms are not well understood for organelles, because in most eukaryotic cells there are numerous organelles with asynchronous cycles of proliferation.Cyanidioschyzon merolae is a thermo-acidophilic unicellular red alga isolated from an Italian volcanic hot spring.3 This organism has an extremely simple cell structure, with one nucleus, one mitochondrion, and one chloroplast. These three genome-containing organelles replicate only once at a specific phase of the cell cycle.4,5 Thus, this organism is an ideal experimental system to clarify the dependency of gene expression in the mitochondrion and the chloroplast on the proliferation cycle. Recently, the full nucleotide sequences of these three genomes were determined.6–9 Phylogenetic analyses of photosynthetic genes suggest that C. merolae is one of the most primitive photosynthetic eukaryotes, and that it diverged just after the monophyletic origin of plastids.10 The genome project also clarified that this alga has a minimally redundant small genome.8,9 Thus, it is a model eukaryote for studies on the basic architecture of eukaryotic cells based on interactions of organelles.4,11–14 Here, we report on the relationship between the replication cycle and the organelle transcriptomes in C. merolae.Most studies on transcription of the chloroplast genome have been performed in vascular plants. Their chloroplast DNA is ~150 kbp in length, and contains >120 genes encoding rRNAs, tRNAs, and proteins.15,16 These genes are transcribed by the cyanobacteria-type plastid-encoded plastid RNA polymerase (PEP). Sigma, which is the essential subunit for initiation of PEP transcription, is encoded by the nuclear genome, and often exists in multiple forms (e.g. six in Arabidopsis). These multiple forms are responsible for the PEP selectivity of promoter activation. Also involved in this activation is a nuclear-encoded plastid RNA polymerase (NEP), which is similar to a T7-type bacteriophage RNA polymerase. This NEP apparently evolved from the nuclear-encoded mitochondrial RNA polymerase.17,18 The nuclear genome of vascular plants encodes multiple genes for NEP-type RNA polymerases, and they are targeted to mitochondria, chloroplasts, or both. Sequential actions of these two RNA polymerases are thought to be essential for chloroplast differentiation.19,20 Genes are usually transcribed as operons, >60 of which have been described in the tobacco chloroplast genome.21 These operons tend to be processed and modified at a later point after transcription, when they are processed into mature transcripts competent for translation.22–24 The number of genes encoded in mitochondrial genomes differs among organisms. However, the transcriptional machinery is always composed of NEP-type enzymes associated with other accessory proteins.25 This system appears to be rather simple compared with those of chloroplasts.Compared with higher plants, there is far less information available for organelle transcriptional machineries in red algae. However, it is likely that the organelle transcription machineries in C. merolae are far simpler than those in vascular plants. As revealed by bioinformatic analyses (http://www.cbs.dtu.dk/services/TargetP/), a unique NEP-type gene encoded by the nuclear genome of C. merolae is predicted to localize in the mitochondrion. This RNA polymerase is likely responsible for the transcription of 62 mitochondrial genes. PEP core subunits, a, ß, and ß', are encoded by the chloroplast genome, and in addition, four sigma subunits for PEP are encoded by the nuclear genome. Besides the RNA polymerase subunits, the chloroplast genome also encodes four bacteria-type transcription factors, which were likely inherited from the ancestral cyanobacterium. These transcription factors likely sustain the organelle's autonomous transcriptional regulation in response to environmental changes.7,26In this study, we examined the relationship between the organelle transcriptome and the cell cycle using a custom-made microarray covering two organelle genomes of C. merolae. Previously, we constructed a microarray covering the chloroplast genome, and analysed light-responsive changes of the transcriptome.26 Here, we show that there is coordinated gene expression between the chloroplast and the mitochondrion, and that the expressions of genes of both organelles are regulated both by light and by the cell cycle. In addition, a correlation clustering analysis revealed that functionally related genes show very similar expression patterns.2. Materials and methods2.1. Algal material and culture conditionsCells of C. merolae 10D were cultured and their growth synchronized as described previously,27 with minor modifications. For synchronization, cells were first cultured in the MA2 medium,28 in which the concentrations of all constituents with the exception of CaCl2, FeCl3, and EDTA (disodium salt) were doubled relative to the original MA medium.29 When the optical density at 750 nm had reached 10, cells were diluted to yield an optical density of 0.5 and were cultivated under a 18 h-dark/6 h-light (150 µmol photons m-2 s-1) cycle at 42°C. Cultures were bubbled with 2% CO2 in air. Experiments with synchronized cultures were initiated at the end of the first dark period (1D18 in Supplementary Fig. S2).2.2. RNA extraction and northern analysisCyanidioschyzon merolae cells were harvested by centrifugation (3000 g, 4°C, 5 min) and stored at -80°C until use. Total RNA was extracted as described previously.30 Aliquots of total RNA (5 µg) were fractioned on a 1% agarose gel containing 0.4 M formaldehyde. Probes were prepared by PCR amplification using specific primers designed from within each open reading frame. Each PCR fragment was cloned into the pT7blue vector (Novagen, Inc., Madison, WI), and then used as a probe after digestion at a suitable restriction site located in the multi-cloning site of the plasmid. Probes were labeled with alkali phosphatase using the AlkPhos direct labeling kit (GE healthcare, Giles, UK) and were hybridized to RNAs blotted onto a positively charged nylon membrane. After incubation for 16 h at 55°C and suitable washing of the membrane, hybridization signals were detected using an Image Analyzer LAS-3000 (Fuji film, Tokyo, Japan).2.3. DNA microarray and correlation clustering analysisWe designed and constructed oligonucleotide-based microarrays that included all organelle genome-encoded open reading frames (ORFs). To synthesize dye-labeled probes for microarray analysis, we used the amino allyl RNA (aRNA) synthesis kit (ver. 2 high yield type; Sigma). Antisense cDNA was synthesized from 5 µg of total RNA by a reverse transcription reaction using a customized 55-mer primer containing a 24-mer T7 promoter and random oligomer sequences (T7dT-N; SIGMA-Aldrich Japan, Komae, Japan). This was followed by an in vitro transcription reaction to incorporate amino allyl nucleotides into aRNA. An aliquot (10 µg) of synthesized aRNA was coupled with Cy3 or Cy5 dyes and purified on an Amicon YM-30 column (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Probes were hybridized to the DNA microarray at 57°C for 16 h, then excess probe was removed by washing with washing solution I (0.2 × SSC, 0.1% SDS) at 50°C for 10 min and then with washing solution II (0.05 × SSC) at room temperature for 5 min.Signals on the DNA microarray were detected with a laser scanner GMS428 (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, CA) and signal intensities were calculated using ImaGene ver. 6.0 (BioDiscovery, El Segundo, CA). Signal intensity of each spot was calculated automatically with the subtraction of local background value. Each signal value was normalized against the averaged intensity of internal control spots. The microarray data of cycloheximide assay were further normalized due to relatively high local background intensity that causes a number of false-positive errors especially in low-intensity signal data. Thus, we manually performed careful local background correction in each spot and flooring treatment by adding a constant value to all data of signal intensity due to Cy3 and Cy5 signals. The control experiment with wild-type cells (Supplementary Fig. S1) demonstrated that the range of experimental errors in the induction factor was between 0.5 and 2.0, as indicated by dashed lines in Supplementary Figs S1 and S2. Clustering analysis of data was carried out using MeV software (TIGR; http://www.tm4.org/mev.html).2.4. Western analysis of sigma factorsTo clone genes encoding the C. merolae sigma factors SIG1, SIG2, SIG3, and SIG4, each open reading frame was amplified by PCR using C. merolae genomic DNA as the template. Each PCR-amplified fragment was inserted into pENTR™/D-TOPO (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's instructions. To prepare the antigen for production of polyclonal antibodies, each cloned gene was recombined into the destination vector pDEST-HIS.30 Preparation and purification of polyclonal antibodies and immunoblot analyses were carried out as described previously.30,313. Results3.1. Design of microarray for analysis of organelle gene expression in C. merolaeThe eukaryotic red alga C. merolae has a fully sequenced genome, and is an important model organism for studying the evolution of primitive photosynthetic eukaryotes.9 In this study, we monitored organelle gene expression in C. merolae during synchronous cultivation to understand the relationship between organelle gene expression and cell cycle events, and to determine whether gene expression in the chloroplast was correlated with that in the mitochondrion. Previously, we prepared and analysed a custom DNA microarray focused on chloroplast genes.26 Here, we prepared a new custom DNA microarray covering both the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes. This enabled comparative analysis of gene expression in both organelles. We designed 50-mer oligonucleotide probes from a highly specific portion of each ORF of the chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes (Supplementary Table SI). These probes were spotted onto a glass slide as a duplicate for statistical reproduction. The results of a control experiment confirmed that experimental errors of our microarray system were low (within a 2-fold difference; Supplementary Fig. S1).Several groups have established synchronous culture systems for C. merolae.5,13 We reconstructed a synchronous culture system with some modifications that optimized cell growth in the MA2 medium.28 Cultures (5 L) were grown in a thermostat jar fermenter and were bubbled with 2% CO2 in air and illuminated with white light (150 µE m-2 s-1). Cells were first incubated for 18 h in the dark, and then incubated for 6 h in the light before incubation for a further 18 h in the dark. Then, cells were cultured in continuous light conditions for 24 h. The cell sample obtained after the first 18-h dark incubation (1D18) was assigned as the time 0 point of the synchronization culture (Fig. 1). Cell samples were collected at 28 time points during the 48-h incubation period (see upper part of Fig. 1B and legend of Supplementary Fig. S2). Sample names in Fig. 1B, such as 1L0.25 (0.25 h after first light illumination), 2D18 (18 h after onset of second dark period) or 2L24 (24 h after second light illumination) correspond to 0.25, 24, and 48 h time points, respectively, in Fig. 1A. The cellular mitotic indexes during incubation in a light–dark cycle and under constant light are shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. Expression profiles of organelle genes in DL and LL conditions.

Coordination of the accumulation of organelle transcripts with the cell cycle phasePreviously, a genome-wide analysis reported that steady-state transcript levels in mitochondria do not vary between light and dark phases and are stable throughout the diurnal time course in Arabidopsis thaliana.32 Another DNA microarray analysis in Nicotiana tabacum also showed that transcript levels of about half of plastid genes were not changed during light and dark conditions.33 Northern analyses in Physcomitrella patens and in C. reinhardtii, several chloroplast genes showed almost constitutive expression in diurnal conditions.34,35 However, it is not clear that these organisms do not have synchronous mechanisms to regulate the transcript levels of organelle genes in a genome-wide manner or this synchrony is difficult to detect by perturbation due to averaged results of numerous organelles in each cell in individual phases of cell cycle. Since C. merolae has only one mitochondrion and one chloroplast, we anticipated that changes in organelle transcript levels in response to external and internal conditions may be more easily recognizable in this organism. Thus, we analysed the expression profiles of genes of C. merolae organelle genomes during synchronous cultivation (Fig. 1A). As expected, expressions of chloroplast and mitochondrial genes were strongly induced by light. We also found that a number of gene transcripts of both organelles showed transient accumulation around 4–8 h after the onset of the dark period. This accumulation also occurred with similar timing during continuous light illumination, which corresponded to 36–38 h after the onset of the first light illumination (Fig. 1A). Thus, this expression pattern appeared to reflect responses to internal events, rather than environmental light conditions. For both organelles, the peaks in transcript accumulation occurred at similar times. This indicated that the accumulation of transcripts from both organelles is coordinately regulated. Microscopic observation revealed that cells were most commonly at the M-G1 phases at these time points (see also Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, the transient accumulations of most organelle transcripts were due to cell cycle-dependent regulation.The peak height of the mitotic index curve gradually diminished and finally became asynchronous due to the diffusion of cell cycle phases among the cells in the culture (Supplementary Fig. S2). Similarly, expression patterns of organelle genes also partly diffused after 42 h from the start of incubation (time 0; Fig. 1). These results provide further evidence that the organelle gene expression pattern is highly correlated with cell cycle events rather than circadian control. In another study, qPCR analysis of the expressions of 74 selected genes (70 nuclear genes and 4 plastid genes) during light–dark cycles14 showed that the expression of a group of light-inducible genes, e.g. the nuclear-encoded atp1 gene for the alpha subunit of mitochondrial ATPase, was transiently induced after M phase during a dark period. Fujiwara et al.12 also detected the accumulation of several transcripts of nuclear-encoded organelle genes, which were specific to S phase or to G2 phase, during a dark period. These two reports indicated that phases of the nuclear cell cycle might affect organelle gene expression and metabolism. Together with our data, these results suggest that there is strong coordination of gene expression among the nucleus, the chloroplast, and the mitochondrion in a cell cycle-dependent manner.3.3. Highly coordinated gene expression of chloroplast and mitochondrial genomesThe expression patterns of chloroplast and mitochondrial genes were very similar (Fig. 1). To estimate the similarity of gene expression patterns of the two organelles by a statistical method, we performed a relative network analysis by calculating the correlation coefficient of the expression profile of each gene using the RelNet function of MeV software (http://www.tm4.org/mev.html; Supplementary Fig. S3). The matrix of the calculated correlation coefficient (R2) for all genes and the list of DNA microarray data are available at the following web site (http://merolae.biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/download/). The results of correlation clustering showed that the co-expression network, R2 > 0.7, covers 302 genes (98%) out of a total of 306 genes in the organelle genomes. This large network included almost all genes of organelle genomes. Expression profiles of only four genes, such as two rRNA genes (CMV029R, CMV032R) and two mitochondrial genes, CMW051R (trnS) and CMW002C (sdhB), were not categorized into this large group. Unfortunately, we could not identify oscillatory patterns from these four expression profiles.3.4. Highly similar expression patterns of functionally related genesIn this study, we observed that genes in the same functional category showed very similar expression patterns. In addition, there were only minor differences in gene expression patterns between the chloroplast and the mitochondrion. To clearly illustrate the results of the correlation analyses, we constructed a tree view of hierarchical clustering according to Pearson correlation coefficients (Fig. 1B). When expression profiles of genes were compared, genes that were functionally related showed much higher correlation coefficients than those of unrelated genes. Thus, functionally related genes assembled into several sub-clusters in the hierarchical tree view. For instance, the tRNA cluster contains 51 genes including 20 tRNAs of both organelles. The light-dependent gene cluster contains 27 plastid genes of photosynthetic machineries. The light- and cell cycle-dependent cluster contains >200 genes of both organelles. The housekeeping gene cluster contains 10 genes such as rRNAs, RNaseP and tmRNA. The genes in the same sub-clusters were not from the same operon or gene cluster in the organelle genomes, except for a large gene cluster of the ribosomal proteins and ATP synthase subunits.7 This result indicates that there is coordinated expression of functionally related genes, although the mechanism by which this coordination occurs is unknown. Mitochondrial and chloroplast genes were also roughly divided into distinct sub-clusters as shown in Fig. 1B.3.5. Classification of gene expression patterns entrained by light or cell cycle phasesNext, we used a template-matching approach36,37 to identify genes whose expressions were highly responsive to light or internal phases (Fig. 2). Genes were grouped by their correlation coefficients (i.e. the similarity of their expression to those of the template genes). According to the results shown in Fig. 1, we chose psbD and rbcL genes as template expression profiles for typical light-responsive and cell cycle-responsive genes, respectively, and confirmed their expression patterns by northern analysis (Fig. 3). Using the PTM calculation function of MeV software, we determined the correlation between the expression pattern of each gene and those of the two template genes. That is, we determined whether and to what extent the expression of each gene resembled that of psbD or rbcL. These correlations are expressed as R2 values (Fig. 2). The psbD-correlated group (Fig. 2A) included many genes for photosynthetic machineries, and their expression patterns were highly light dependent. Some of these genes consisted of operons, but most were located at distinct loci on the chloroplast genome. The expressions of the genes in this group were slightly induced at the end of the second dark period (Fig. 2A), which is likely due to circadian oscillation. The rbcL-correlated group (Fig. 2B) included genes for translation machineries, ATP synthase, and so on. The expression of these genes showed transient induction just after the onset of light illumination as well as at the M-G1 phase (Fig. 2B). Some genes were expressed at relatively constant levels throughout the experimental period (Fig. 2C). This group (Fig. 2C) contained a number of tRNAs and several housekeeping genes, such as the rnpB gene. Even in this group, gene expression was increased or decreased at several time points during the cell cycle. The expression of the rnpB gene in Cluster III was confirmed by northern analysis (Fig. 3). Template-matching analysis to identify light-dependent, cell cycle-dependent, or relatively constant genes in chloroplast and mitochondrial genomes. (A) Light-dependent genes showed a high correlation coefficient with the psbD gene, whose expression is highly light specific. (B) Cell cycle-dependent genes showed a high correlation coefficient with the rbcL gene, whose expression is highly specific to cell cycle phases. (C) Genes expressed at relatively constant levels. Upper panels show model pattern of gene expression used as a template for the calculation of the correlation coefficient in each group.

A methylene blue-stained membrane was shown in the bottom panel to show the amount of rRNAs.Next, we searched for conserved elements in the 5' upstream and 3' downstream regions of the genes in each group using the web-based tool Melina II (http://melina2.hgc.jp/public/index.html). No conserved elements were found in the 5' upstream region; however, we identified a conserved element in the 3' downstream region of genes in each group by the program: CONSENSUS and MD scan in the Melina II [Supplementary Fig. S5 (element found in the light-inducible genes) and 6 (element found in the cell cycle-dependent genes)]. These elements were found in most genes in each group. The ORFs, which does not possess this element in their 3' downstream region was not the terminal gene of the putative operon. Positions of each element in the 120 base of 3' downstream region of each gene were shown in Supplementary Figs S5 and S6. Several genes have plural number of the elements in their 3' downstream region.3.6. Expression of nuclear-encoded sigma factors of chloroplast RNA polymeraseAs described in Section 1, PEP appears to be the sole chloroplast transcription machinery in C. merolae. Four nuclear genes, CMK044C, CMQ213C, CMR165C, and CMM072C are predicted to encode sigma factors for PEP, SIG1, SIG2, SIG3, and SIG4, respectively.26 Previously, it was shown that light induces the accumulation of transcripts of these four sigma factor genes.26 Thus, they are likely responsible for the light activation of chloroplast gene expression. To understand the link between chloroplast transcription and the expression of sigma factors, we analysed the expression of these four sigma factors at the protein level. First, we prepared four types of recombinant proteins (SIG1, SIG2, SIG3, and SIG4) using an Escherichia coli system, and then obtained specific antibodies against each protein (see Supplementary Fig. S4). Then, expression levels of the four sigma factors were determined by immunoblot analysis during synchronized cultivation in the same conditions as those shown in Fig. 1 (Fig. 4). In each case, we detected two bands, presumably the precursor and the processed mature protein. These bands were not detected in the corresponding preimmune sera (Supplementary Fig. S4). The size of each SIG precursor was predicted from the C. merolae genome database (http://merolae.biol.s.u-tokyo.ac.jp/), as follows: Sig1, 80 kDa; Sig2, 52 kDa; Sig3, 73 kDa; and Sig4, 67 kDa. Band sizes of CmSIG3 and CmSIG4 proteins were higher than that predicted from the database. It means some modifications such as phosphorylation38 of sigma factors might be occurring in vivo. In the case of SIG3 and SIG4, the band intensity of the precursor was much higher than that of the mature protein at several time points. This result suggests that sigma factor proteins may be regulated at the translocation and/or maturation steps. The amount of SIG1 protein increased after the onset of light illumination and also at specific cell cycle phases (M-G1 and G1-S), indicating that SIG1 may be involved in cell-cycle specific transcriptional activation. SIG2 protein was detected only in light conditions, suggesting that this sigma factor may be involved in light-dependent chloroplast gene expression, which is observed for genes such as psbD (Fig. 3). SIG3 and SIG4 proteins were found constitutively during the dark–light (DL) and constant light (LL) cycles, although all four SIG gene expressions have been reported as light inducible.26 Therefore, expressions of SIG3 and SIG4 are probably regulated at translational or post-translational levels. These sigma factor proteins may contribute to the basal expression of housekeeping genes in the chloroplast. These results indicated that the expression of sigma factor proteins can categorized into three groups: cell cycle phase-specific, light-dependent, or relatively constant. These three groups roughly correlate with the results of the clustering analysis of the DNA microarray. The expression of proteins of nuclear-encoded sigma factors for plastid RNA polymerase. Cells were collected at indicated time points during synchronized culture. Protein extraction and western analyses were conducted as described in Section 2. Precursors and mature proteins are indicated by white and black triangles, respectively. Time point 1D18 corresponds to time 0 point in Fig. 1.

The preparation and specificity of the antibodies were shown in Supplementary Fig. S4. The Sig2 protein showed a typical light-dependent accumulation.3.7. Light-inducible organelle gene expression was inhibited by cycloheximide and dibromothymoquinoneNext, we examined the signaling pathways involved in light-inducible gene expression in organelles using three inhibitors: cycloheximide, 3-(3,4-dichlorophenyl)-1,1-dimethylurea (DCMU), and dibromothymoquinone (DBMIB) (Fig. 5). Cells were treated with these inhibitors at the end of 18 h dark incubation (time 0 in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S2), and then subjected to light conditions for 1 h. In an experiment using the cytoplasmic translation inhibitor cycloheximide, Kawazoe et al.39 found that light-inducible plastid gene expression in Chlamydomonas required de novo protein synthesis in the cytoplasm. In C. merolae, de novo synthesis of cytoplasmic protein was also required for light-inducible organelle gene expression. Taking the results shown in Figs 4and 5 into consideration, the inhibition of SIG1 and SIG2 protein synthesis may be responsible for the inhibitory effect of cycloheximide. We also determined the effects of the photosynthesis inhibitors DCMU and DBMIB. DCMU inhibits the electron transfer of QA to QB in the PSII complex, inhibiting linear electron flow.40 DCMU did not affect the accumulation of transcripts after the shift from dark to light. However, DBMIB, which is assumed to inhibit the access of reduced plastoquinone to the cytochrome b6f complex (Cyt b6f),41 causing the inhibition of both linear and cyclic electron flow, severely inhibited light-induced gene expression in both organelles. Effects of inhibitors on light-inducible gene expression in organelles. Inhibitors were added to cell cultures in dark conditions (1D18; time 0). Cells were then incubated for 1 h in light conditions (150 µEm-2s-1). Total RNA was extracted from cells and used for DNA microarray analyses. Experiments were reproduced twice in biologically independent conditions and yielded essentially the same results. Final concentrations of inhibitors were as follows: cycloheximide (100 µM), DCMU (10 µM), and DBMIB (5 µM). Suitable concentrations of DCMU and DBMIB that do not affect the respiration but inhibit the cellular proliferation, cell division and light-induced oxygen evolution were determined by oxygen electrode and microscopic analysis. Cycloheximide and DBMIB inhibited the light-inducible gene expression of organelle genomes.Effects of inhibitors on light-inducible gene expression in organelles.

Stability of chloroplast transcripts under light and dark conditionsIn vascular plants, accumulation of chloroplast transcripts is usually regulated at a post-transcriptional level, such as stability, modification, editing, and translation (reviewed in).42 Here, we used the rifampicin assay to examine changes in stability of several transcripts under light and dark conditions. Rifampicin is a specific inhibitor of the bacterial-type chloroplast RNA polymerase, and has been shown to be effective in red algae.43,44 Rifampicin was added to the cells 2 h after the first onset of light illumination (1L2) or 8 h after the second dark shift (2D8). As shown in Fig. 6, psbD and clpC transcripts were more stable during the light phase, suggesting regulation at the level of mRNA stability. However, the stability of rbcLS gene transcripts remained constant in light and dark conditions. Thus, the transient accumulation of rbcLS transcripts in the M-G1 phase (Fig. 3) during the dark period was likely due to transcriptional activation. Stability of rnpB transcripts, which showed a relatively constant expression pattern (Fig. 3), was also unaffected by the light conditions. Analysis of the stability of some mRNAs in the chloroplast. Rifampicin (100 µg/ml) was added at indicated time point and cells were collected before (time 0) and after treatment (2, 5, 10, and 30 min). Signal intensity shown in lower panels was normalized against rRNA. Values are means of three independent experiments ± standard deviation.

Correlation between organelle gene expression and nuclear cell cycle phasesIn this study, we examined profiles of chloroplast and mitochondrial gene expression in C. merolae and found that gene expression in both organelles was highly responsive to cell cycle control and environmental light conditions. As shown in Fig. 2, genes for transcription, translation, ATP synthesis, and RuBisCO are candidate genes whose expressions are obviously controlled by the cell cycle. However, it remains unclear how and why many organelle transcripts accumulated at the M-G1 phase, even in dark conditions. Cyanidioschyzon merolae is a photoautotrophic organism containing only one mitochondrion and one plastid, and a synchronous culture system entrained by light and dark cycles has been established. Thus, C. merolae is an ideal system for studying cell cycle-coordinated gene expression in organelles, because unlike other organelle analysis systems, it does not have multiple organelles with asynchronous replication. In vascular and other green plants, it is very difficult to obtain synchrony of proliferation cycles because of the abundant mitochondria and chloroplasts in the cell. In a previous study with tobacco BY-2 culture cells, use of organelle DNA replication inhibitor, nalidixic acid, could synchronously arrest the organelle proliferation cycle, and thus we could successfully observe the organelle-to-nucleus signaling pathway and its regulatory mechanisms.4,45,46 This kind of approach may help the understanding of events occurring in cells containing multiple organelles.4.2. Nuclear factors for light-inducible gene expression in the organellesInhibition of cytosolic translation by cycloheximide abolished the light-induced transcriptional activation of genes from both organelles. This result suggests the involvement of nuclear-encoded proteins in transcriptional activation (Fig. 5). As described in Section 1, the nuclear genome of C. merolae encodes only one NEP-type RNA polymerase that is predicted to be targeted into the mitochondrion, plastid transcription is likely dependent only on PEP. Since the PEP activity and the specificity are dominated by nuclear-encoded sigma subunits, it is reasonable to consider that the expression of sigma factors is responsible for the control of the plastid transcriptome. As shown in Fig. 4, accumulation profile of SIG1 and SIG2 proteins showed the cell-cycle correlated pattern and the light-dependent pattern, respectively. These patterns well correlate with the expression profiles of cell-cycle correlated genes and light-dependent genes in the plastid genome, respectively, as shown in Fig. 2. Consistently, inhibition of light-inducible de novo synthesis of these SIG proteins by cycloheximide abolished the light-inducible expression of plastid genes (Fig. 5). These results strongly suggest the sigma factor-dependent molecular mechanism for the correlations provided in this study. On the other hand, cycloheximide did not affect the basal levels of transcripts in the organelles (Fig. 5). Thus, it is likely that the basal accumulation of transcripts is dependent on the constitutively expressed sigma factors, SIG3 and/or SIG4. Light induction of mitochondrial gene expression could also be regulated by nuclear-encoded factors including the NEP-type mitochondrial RNA polymerase (CMJ257C) and other regulator(s). The effects of cycloheximide on mitochondrial gene expression (Fig. 5) may be explained by inhibition of these proteins synthesized de novo in the cytoplasm.In a green alga, C. reinhardtii which has no NEP in chloroplasts and it seems to have only one sigma factor,47,48 the plastid gene expression is limited mainly to the post-transcriptional level.49,50 Thus, the sigma factor in C. reinhardtii is considered as just a factor for basal transcription. However, our results suggest the red alga, C. merolae, selectively uses four sigma factors depending on the cellular conditions similarly with vascular plants. These results must contribute to the research field of sigma factor-mediated regulation of plastid transcription.4.3. Light-inducible organelle gene expression is affected by a DBMIB-related processWhat senses the light for the light-inducible organelle gene expression in C. merolae? Our results revealed that a process inhibited by DBMIB is essential for light-inducible gene expression in both organelles. These results, together with the results of cycloheximide addition (Fig. 5) suggest that de novo synthesis of specific nuclear-encoded protein(s) is required. The expression of these proteins is dependent on light sensing around the thylakoid membrane and subsequent signal transduction to the nucleus. It has been argued that the photosynthesis-driven redox state is involved in light-dependent transcript accumulation in chloroplasts, i.e. the redox state is the mechanism for light-dependent regulation of chloroplast transcription. For example, it was suggested that the plastoquinol/plastoquinone ratio in the thylakoid membrane affects the expression of the chloroplast psbA and psaAB genes.51 On the other hand, Matsuo and Obokata52 concluded that induction of the expression of Chlamydomonas PSI mRNAs is dependent on light illumination, but not on the redox state of plastoquinone. Our results indicate that the light-inducible gene expression in chloroplast does not depend on the redox state of plastoquinone pool, but depending on the integrity of the plastoquinol-oxidizing site of the Cytb6f complex. A report also suggested that a Cyt b6f-related factor, which is inhibited by DBMIB, affects the light-induced expression of several nuclear-encoded plastid proteins in Chlamydomonas.53 In C. merolae, our results suggested that a Cyt b6f-related factor is crucial for sensing light and subsequent transcriptional activation (Fig. 7). Cyanidioschyzon merolae possesses neither phytochrome nor phototropin as photoreceptors, but has five nuclear genes that encode cryptochrome-related proteins. However, blue-light-dependent gene expression was not observed in C. merolae (unpublished observations), and thus, the photosynthetic electron transfer process in the thylakoid membrane may itself function as the light sensor for transcriptional activation. The inhibitory effect of DBMIB is consistent with this scheme, whereas the signaling process from the chloroplast to the nucleus remains unknown.

Correlation between changes of chloroplast and mitochondrial transcriptomesThis study represents the first report of highly synchronous global gene expression profiles in the chloroplast and mitochondrion. This phenomenon is probably due to synchronous activation of nuclear-encoded factors, such as SIG proteins. It is likely that this synchrony is essential for coordination of the functions of these two organelles in light- and cell cycle-dependent manners. The successful functioning of important metabolic pathways including lipid biosynthesis, tetrapyrrole biosynthesis, and photorespiration rely on inter-organelle exchanges of metabolites. The coordinated activity of the two organelles would be important to optimize these reactions. In another study, impaired chloroplast development affected steady-state transcript levels in mitochondria in the barley albostrians mutant.54 Our synchronous system clearly showed that coordination of gene expression between the plastid and mitochondrion is dynamically modulated by the light and cell cycle in C. merolae.4.5. Correlations among changes in transcript levels of functionally related genesAs in bacterial transcriptional regulation, organelle-encoded genes tend to be transcribed as poly-cistronic RNAs from a limited number of transcriptional start sites. It is well known, especially in chloroplasts of green lineages, that such large transcripts are subsequently processed into smaller units, and that gene expression is primarily regulated at the post-transcriptional level. In this study, we performed cluster analysis for C. merolae organelle transcripts, and found that chloroplast genes with the same function frequently show similar expression profiles, even when their chromosomal loci are not linked to each other (Fig. 2). These data indicated the presence of a common regulator and regulatory elements for each cluster. As discussed above, sigma factors for the chloroplast RNA polymerase may function as the transcriptional regulators for these clusters. Recently, Minoda et al.55 clarified that a plastid-encoded transcription factor, Ycf30 (CbbR), is able to bind to the promoter region of the rbcLS operon and up-regulates their expression in the isolated-chloroplasts of C. merolae. Together with three other transcription factors encoded in the plastid genome, these regulators may also be involved in the correlated gene expressions. In addition, we found conserved sequence elements within the 3' regions of light-dependent (Fig. 2A) and cell cycle-dependent (Fig. 2B) genes. In Chlamydomonas, the endonuclease CSP41, which binds the stem-loop structure of the 3' untranslated region of transcripts,56,57 is a major regulator of transcript stability. Two homologs of CSP41 in C. merolae, CMH047C and CML047C, are candidates for such post-transcriptional controls. PPR proteins encoded by the nuclear genome may also have roles in the modulation of mRNA processing and the stability.584.6. Effect of circadian rhythms on organelle gene expressionExpression of photosynthetic genes, such as the psbD gene in the chloroplast genome, and the nuclear-encoded SIG2 proteinshowed weak induction at the time point of artificial dawn, suggesting that gene expression showed a circadian rhythm (Figs. 3 and 4). In Chlamydomonas, nuclear regulation of chloroplast circadian period was observed.59 In C. merolae, it also seems that the factor due to the nuclear circadian rhythm affects the expression of SIG2 protein, and SIG2 entrain the expression pattern of the photosynthetic genes, such as the psbD with that of nuclear rhythms. In terms of cell-cycle control, the expression patterns of organelle genes appeared to be dominated by the index of cell division. These observations indicate that light and cell cycle controls are more important factors in the patterns of organelle gene expression than the circadian rhythm in C. merolae.4.7. Fundamental differences between C. merolae and other organismsIn our system, synchrony of transcript levels of organelle genes was detected in C. merolae. In vascular plants, such coordination of organelle gene expression has not been observed so far. One possible reason is that organelle proliferation cycle and division cycles are not coordinated with the cell cycle in mature plant cells. Second possible reason is that they do not have any synchronous mechanism to regulate the transcript levels of organelle genes in a genome-wide manner. Third possibility is that the synchrony is difficult to detect due to averaged results from unsynchronized organelles in each cell throughout the cell cycle. To discriminate these three possibilities, it would be helpful to check the coordination of organelle gene expression during the specific experimental conditions where organelle proliferation occurs synchronously in plant cells. As Kobayashi et al.4 showed in tobacco BY-2 cells, organelle proliferation synchronously begins after transferring the stationary phased cells to new culture media. Using the similar experimental condition, some coordinated pattern of mitochondrial gene expression was observed by EST and microarray analyses.60 While only fragmental data have been obtained from vascular plants, this kind of evidence may suggest the presence of coordination mechanism for organelle transcriptome in vascular plants in specific conditions such as developing organ, where the mitochondrial DNA replication is highly activated.61 Available information suggests that BY-2 cells could be a good model system to investigate the relationship of organelle transcription and organelle proliferation. Recently, Maple et al.62 found that a nuclear-encoded gene whose transcript level was commonly affected in three arc mutants with altered plastid division phenotypes. This report indicates the relationship between plastid division cycle and cellular gene expression in plant cells. However, in case of mature cells of higher eukaryotic cells, mitochondria divide or fuse almost randomly and a part of them does not contain any DNA.63,64 Thus, the relationship of mitochondrial division cycle and cellular gene expression in plant cells is still unclear.Why is not organelle proliferation in other species more synchronous? Chloroplasts and mitochondria are considered to have originated from bacterial symbionts and thus are possessing high autonomy as the nature of independent organism. Thus, it is not surprising that their proliferation and division cycles do not synchronize in a cell containing multiple organelles. On the other hand, the host cell and the endosymbionts must have evolved tight coordination mechanism to couple the organelle proliferation and division cycles with the cell cycle of the host cell, which should be most apparent when the number of organelle is only one in a cell. Details of these coordination mechanisms are still elusive, and to be clarified in future studies.We thank Drs T. Fujiwara, O. Misumi, and T.

IntroductionMutations are the main factors driving genome evolution and may happen within genes through base substitutions or involve their entire duplication.1 In the latter case, two mechanisms have been recognized: whole-genome duplication (WGD) and small-scale duplication (SSD), which occurs in relatively a small region of the genome during evolution. For instance, the early vertebrate ancestor is thought to have undergone two rounds of WGD,2–5 as suggested by four vertebrate Hox gene clusters located in different chromosomes. Paralogous genes originated from WGD are referred to as ohnologues.6 Singletons, in turn, are genes that did not undergo either WGD or SSD.In general, duplicated genes are redundant and their functions overlap. Thus, in simple organisms such as yeasts and nematodes, the proportion of essential genes in duplicated genes is half as low as that in singletons.7,8 In mice, however, the proportion of essential genes is comparable between duplicated genes and singletons.9,10 Furthermore, ohnologues are likely to contain a larger proportion of essential genes than SSD genes.11 Ohnologues are indeed associated with development, the regulation of transcription, and protein complex formation.11 For these genes to function properly, the relative amount of their products must be balanced.12–14 WGD typically involves the simultaneous duplication of all genes, therefore preserving the relative dosages of each gene. Because either the loss or the gain of ohnologues may lead to dosage imbalance, ohnologues are expected to be retained intact in the genome.15 Similarly, ancient WGD-derived ohnologues are expected to be more conservative than recently evolved SSD genes.Gene expression can be tissue-specific, determining phenotypes such as the morphology and function of tissues, or ubiquitous. Previous research indicates that ubiquitously expressed genes are likely to evolve slowly.16–18 For example, in humans and mice, the orthologous genes that are expressed in a limited number of tissues tend to evolve faster than ubiquitously expressed genes.18 Little is known, however, about the extent to which the evolution of tissues is influenced by the differential modes of gene duplication and expression. Indeed, there are no reports exploring the effects of gene duplication events, such as WGD and SSD, on tissue-restricted or ubiquitous gene expression.In this study, the potential associations between gene evolutionary rates, duplication (WGD, SSD, and singletons), and gene expression breadth in different tissues (restricted or ubiquitous) were investigated. In addition, these parameters were also analysed in relation to the developmental origin of tissues (endodermal, mesenchymal, or ectodermal). The results support the notion that both base substitutions within genes and gene duplication are associated with gene expression breadth and that the nature of duplication (WGD or SSD) differs substantially depending on the germ-layer origin of the tissue. Tissue evolution is therefore discussed here as the outcome of a process involving the gene evolutionary rate, duplication, and expression.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Classification of human genes based on the gene duplication modeProtein-coding genes of human origin were obtained from Ensembl release 52 (http://www.ensembl.org). A total of 7294 ohnologues and 9027 SSD genes were defined as described in Makino and McLysaght.15 Briefly, duplicated genes were so judged when the two aligned sequences showed homology in their >30% length with e < 10-7 in BLAST search. Ohnologues were syntenic genes located on paralogous chromosomal regions and derived from WGD, whereas SSD genes were duplicated genes not experiencing WGD. Of the 9027 SSD genes, 1478 genes were classified as both ohnologues and SSD genes and, therefore, excluded from the analysis, resulting in 7549 pure SSD genes. An additional 6064 genes were classified as singletons. Thus, 20 907 genes (7294 + 7549 + 6064 = 20 907) were considered.To define the origin of SSDs, a sequence similarity search was performed within protein-coding human genes using the all-against-all BLASTP program. Synonymous substitution rates (KS) were estimated for each close paralogue. There were 2510 and 5039 SSD genes for which KS were <1 (recent SSD) and =1 (old SSD), respectively (2510 + 5039 = 7549).2.2. Human orthologous genes and gene evolutionary ratesHuman genes with orthologues in mice and other species were obtained from Ensembl release 52. Orthologous sequences were aligned using CLUSTALW,19 and KS and non-synonymous substitution rates (KA) were deduced for each orthologous pair using the method of Yang and Nielsen20 implemented in PAML.21 Next, <U+03C9> values (KA/KS) were calculated.2.3. Human EST dataAn expression sequence tag (EST) database22 was used to determine the expression profile of human genes in various tissues. The data were registered at NCBI and included 3 199 559 reads from 47 different human tissues. Each tissue contained more than 10 000 ESTs (68 076 on an average). Using these 47 tissues, the breadth of expression of a gene was represented by the number of tissues in which the gene was identified, as based on the detection of ESTs.22 Thus, breadth varied from 1 to 47. Among the 20 907 human genes considered for analysis, there were 3871 for which ESTs were not identified in the EST database. These genes were excluded from further analyses, therefore resulting in a total number of genes of 17 036, among which 6 952 were ohnologues, 5505 were SSDs, and 4579 were singletons.2.4. Classification of human tissues based on the developmental originForty-three tissues were classified into four subgroups based on their developmental origin, as follows: endoderm (nasopharynx, thymus, stomach, colon, bladder, liver, trachea, lung, pancreas, uterus, cervix, prostate, and intestine), ectoderm (breast, skin, caudate nucleus, hypothalamus, eye, thalamus, subthalamic nucleus, cerebellum, hippocampus, corpus callosum, nervous system, amygdala, and substantia nigra), mesenchymal (synovium, kidney, adipose tissue, bone, adrenal gland, cartilage, muscle, pericardium, and heart), and haemocytes (B cells, bone marrow, germinal centre B cells, blood cells, lymph node, spleen, blood vessels, and T lymphocytes). The developmental origin of four tissues, such as ovary, testis, amnion, and placenta, was not categorized into any of the above four subgroups.One caveat of this classification, however, is that the intestine is classified as an endodermal tissue based on the presence of endoderm-derived intestinal epithelium. However, as a macroscopic organ, the intestine includes not only epithelium but also mesoderm-derived tissues such as the submucosa and muscles. Thus, in the above classification, an endodermal tissue usually includes both endoderm- and mesoderm-derived tissues, whereas an ectodermal tissue includes both ectoderm- and mesoderm-derived tissues.2.5. Definition of tissue evolutionary ratesThe tissue evolutionary rate was originally calculated by Kuma et al.23 and this method has been adopted in the succeeding studies.18,24 Thus, we simply employed their definition in the present study. We assumed that a set of genes are expressed in a given tissue type and that the <U+03C9> values of expressing genes are X1, X2, …, Xm (for ohnologues), Y1, Y2, …, Yn (for SSD genes), and Z1, Z2, …, Zo (for singletons). The evolutionary rate of this tissue is then given by: [(X1 + X2 + ··· + Xm) + (Y1 + Y2 + ··· + Yn) + (Z1 + Z2 + ··· + Zo)]/(m + n + o), where m, n, and o are the respective number of ohnologues, SSD genes, and singletons.3. Results3.1. Association between expression breadth and duplication modeFigure 1 shows the gene number distribution over various expression breadths (note that the actual number of genes expressed in each tissue at each expression breadth is shown in Supplementary Table S1). Figure 1A–C displays the numbers of ohnologues, SSD genes, and singletons, respectively. The average number of tissues in which each gene type was expressed was 18.7 for ohnologues (blue), 16.6 for SSD genes (red), and 18.0 for singletons (green). Figure 1D shows that the proportions of each gene type in each expression breadth were noticeably different. Specifically, the proportion of SSD genes was relatively higher among breadth-restricted genes (see n = 1, n = 3, n = 5, and n = 10), whereas the proportion of ohnologues was increasingly higher among genes expressed in a larger number of tissues (see n > 10, n > 20, and n > 40).

Association between gene evolutionary rates and duplication modeOhnologues are believed to be more conservative than SSD genes with respect to functional essentiality and dosage-balance requirement.11,15 To determine whether ohnologues are also conservative in terms of molecular evolution, non-synonymous nucleotide divergence in the coding region (between humans and mice) were examined. Table 1 shows that the average <U+03C9> value of ohnologues (0.11) was 0.55–0.57-fold lower than that of SSD genes (0.19; P < 2.2 × 10-16, the Mann–Whitney U-test) and of singletons (0.20; P < 2.2 × 10-16). The result confirms the conservative nature of ohnologues in the evolution of coding regions. Average KA/Ks valuesAverage KA/Ks values3.3. Tissue evolutionary rates in restricted expression breadthsIn Fig. 2A, tissue evolutionary rates are plotted in an increasing order, for each of 47 tissues, and under a condition of n = 10 (see ‘Proportions of ohnologues and SSD genes in various expression breadths’ as for a rationale of the use of n = 10).

Gene evolutionary rate in restricted expression breadthsThe average <U+03C9> values were calculated separately for each type of gene as follows: (X1 + X2 + ··· + Xm)/m for ohnologues, (Y1 + Y2 + ··· + Yn)/n for SSD genes, and (Z1 + Z2 + ··· + Zo)/o for singletons. Figure 2B shows that the evolutionary rate (<U+03C9>) of ohnologues (blue), SSD genes (red), and singletons (green) increased gradually in line with increases in tissue evolutionary rates, indicating that all gene types evolved in parallel with the tissue evolution. Therefore, gene evolutionary rates were higher in the genes that are expressed in fast evolving tissues irrespective of the gene type, whereas those were lower in slowly evolving tissues regardless of the gene type. It is worth noticing, however, that the average <U+03C9> value of ohnologues was low (0.13), whereas that of SSD genes and singletons was high (0.26 and 0.29, respectively; Fig. 2B and see n = 10 in Table 1).3.5. Proportions of gene type in restricted expression breadthsFigure 2C shows that an increase in tissue evolutionary rates was accompanied by a corresponding decrease in the proportion of ohnologues and an increase in the proportion of SSD genes. This result indicates that ohnologues and SSD genes tended to be expressed in slowly and fast evolving tissues, respectively. The proportion of singletons also appeared to increase in parallel with tissue evolutionary rates.Figure 2B and C also indicates that ohnologues and SSD genes behave differently. In the case of SSD genes, <U+03C9> values as well as proportions are positively associated with tissue evolutionary rates, suggesting that SSD genes contribute to faster tissue evolution. In the case of ohnologues, however, an increase in <U+03C9> was associated with a decrease in proportion, accompanying the tissue evolutionary rate. Therefore, further analysis is needed to examine the relative contribution of ohnologues to tissue evolution.3.6. Differential contribution of ohnologues, SSD genes, and singletons among genes with restricted expression3.7. Equal contribution of ohnologues, SSD genes, and singletons among genes with ubiquitous expressionFigure 2E–H represents the results obtained under a condition of n > 10 tissues and show virtually no variation (flat lines) for all parameters measured and gene types among tissues. This is not surprising given the ubiquitous nature of the expression of each gene type in a broad range of tissues. The average <U+03C9> values when n > 10 tissues were remarkably lower, particularly for SSD genes and singletons (0.15 and 0.17, respectively), than those in observed when n = 10 tissues (0.26 and 0.29, respectively; Fig. 2F and B and Table 1). In terms of the proportion of gene types (Fig. 2G), the proportion of ohnologues (40%) was substantially higher than that of SSD genes and singletons (30% in both cases). This result is in sharp contrast to that found for expression breadths of n = 10 tissues, indicating that among those genes that are expressed ubiquitously, there is a larger proportion of ohnologues and a lower proportion of SSD genes and singletons. Finally, the relative contribution of ohnologues, SSD genes, and singletons is nearly the same for all tissues (Fig. 2H), which is in high contrast to the situation where n = 10 tissues (Fig. 2D).Overall, the results show that the relative proportion of ohnologues, SSD genes, and singletons, as well as their evolutionary rates, are substantially different between genes with ubiquitous and restricted expression breadths.3.8. Proportions of ohnologues and SSD genes in various expression breadthsTo confirm the previous findings, we analysed cases involving expression breadths other than n = 10 and n > 10 tissues. Similar results to those shown in Fig. 2A–D were obtained for n = 1, n = 3, n = 5, n = 20, and n = 40 tissues, whereas similar observations as those indicated in Fig. 2E–H were obtained for n > 20 and n > 40 tissues (data not shown). Figure 3 shows the proportion of ohnologues (blue) and SSD genes (red) for each tissue under various expression breadths (n = 1, n = 3, n = 5, n = 10, n = 20, n = 40, n > 10, n > 20, and n > 40). The x-axis represents the tissue evolutionary rate, whereas the y-axis represents the proportions of ohnologues and SSD genes. In tissue-restricted expression (n = 1, n = 3, n = 5, n = 20, and n = 40), the faster the tissue evolutionary rates, the higher the proportion of SSD genes and the lower the proportion of ohnologues expressed (correlation coefficients and P-values are shown in Supplementary Table S2). When the expression breadth was =10, a statistically significant correlation was detected for both the ohnologues and SSD genes (P = 1.6 × 10-13 and P = 2.1 × 10-5, respectively). A similar correlation was observed when the expression breadth was set at =20 and =40. However, the correlation became rather weak in these cases. Therefore, at expression breadth =10, correlation became maximum and most reliable. Proportion of ohnologues and SSD genes at various gene expression breadths. The y-axis represents the proportions of ohnologues (blue) and SSD genes (red), whereas the x-axis shows the tissue evolutionary rates [the average KA/KS (<U+03C9>) value of all genes expressed in a given tissue]. P-values and linear correlation coefficients are shown in Supplementary Table S2.Proportion of ohnologues and SSD genes at various gene expression breadths.

P-values and linear correlation coefficients are shown in Supplementary Table S2.On the other hand, in those cases where n > 20 and n > 40 tissues, the proportion of ohnologues was higher and the proportion of SSD genes was lower but there was no significant correlation between tissue evolutionary rates and the proportion of either gene type.3.9. Orthologous genes between human and other vertebratesThe previous analyses involved genes that are orthologous in human and mice. However, the origin of ohnologues can be traced back to the emergence of vertebrates. Therefore, human orthologues in various vertebrates, including rat, cow, dog, opossum, and chicken, were extracted from Ensembl. Using an expression breadth of n = 10, analyses similar to those shown in Fig. 2C were performed. In the results shown in Supplementary Fig. S1, human genes were used as references for pairwise comparisons. Similar to the results shown in Fig. 2C, the comparison between humans and other species (Supplementary Table S3) shows that those tissues with higher <U+03C9> values were associated with a larger proportion of SSD genes than with ohnologues.3.10. Recent SSD genes contribute to faster tissue evolutionApproximate gene duplication times can be estimated based on KS values, with lower and higher KS values corresponding to recent and ancient duplication events, respectively. To examine the relative contribution of each SSD gene to tissue expression, a threshold value of KS was set to 1.0 and the number and the percentage of each SSD gene at various expression breadths were counted (Fig. 4A–C). Narrower expression breadths were associated with a larger percentage of recent SSD genes (KS < 1.0, red), whereas the percentage of ancient SSD genes (KS = 1.0, pink) was nearly constant regardless of expression breadth. These results indicate a higher contribution of recent SSD genes to tissue-restricted gene expression. Recent and ancient SSD genes.

(A–C) The number and the percentage of ancient (pink) and recent (red) SSD genes are shown for each tissue expression breadth. (D) The proportions of ancient and recent SSD genes among genes with tissue-restricted expression limited to n = 10 tissues.An additional analysis similar to that shown in Fig. 2C was performed using recent and ancient SSD genes as criteria. The results are shown in Fig. 4D (expression breadth =10 tissues). Co-linearity between <U+03C9> values and gene proportions was 0.58 for recent (P = 1.7 × 10-5) and 0.33 for ancient SSD genes (P = 0.024), indicating a larger contribution of recent SSD genes to the positive co-linearity among all SSD genes observed in Fig. 2C. Yet, the slightly positive co-linearity observed for ancient SSD genes indicates that ancient SSD genes are distinct from ohnologues, which showed negative co-linearity. These results indicate that the evolution of SSD genes of both recent and ancient origins, as well as of ohnologues, is distinct in nature.3.11. Association between gene evolutionary rates, duplication mode, and developmental origin of tissuesIn the analyses of the results shown in Fig. 2, fast and slow tissue evolutionary rates were based on <U+03C9> values but we did not address tissue types. To examine how <U+03C9> values and the proportion of SSD genes and ohnologues are associated with the developmental origin of tissues, <U+03C9> values as well as the proportions of ohnologues, SSD genes, and singletons were calculated for each tissue type. Values calculated for the four subgroups with a breadth of n = 10 tissues are presented in Fig. 5 (Supplementary Table S4 shows P-values).

P-values for pairwise comparisons are shown in Supplementary Table S4.The average <U+03C9> values were significantly higher in endodermal, intermediate in mesenchymal, and lower in ectodermal tissues (Fig. 5A). Conversely, the proportion of ohnologues was higher in ectodermal than in endodermal and mesenchymal tissues (Fig. 5B), whereas the proportion of SSD genes was highest in endodermal, intermediate in mesenchymal, and lowest in ectodermal tissues (Fig. 5C). The proportion of singletons did not vary among the three subgroups (Fig. 5D). Therefore, it is possible that SSD genes with higher <U+03C9> values might have contributed to the faster evolution of endodermal tissues, whereas ohnologues with lower <U+03C9> values might have functioned to maintain the essential characteristics of ectodermal tissues. Mesenchymal tissues occupied an intermediate position.3.12. The unique evolutionary position of haemocytesHaemocyte genes displayed unique features that were distinct from those of the three subgroups of tissues described previously. Specifically, the average <U+03C9> value of haemocyte genes was the highest, whereas the proportion of haemocyte ohnologues was the lowest. Furthermore, the proportion of haemocyte singletons was higher than that of the other three subtypes of tissues.4. Discussion4.1. Gene evolutionary rate, duplication, and expression breadthIn the present study, the putative association between gene evolutionary rates, duplication, and their expression breadth in different tissues was examined. Gene evolutionary rates are affected by various factors. For example, duplicated genes are believed to evolve relatively fast, whereas singletons evolve more slowly.1 Another important factor is the expression breadth of each gene. Genes expressed in a wide range of tissues tend to evolve more slowly, whereas those restricted to a narrow range of tissues evolve faster.18,25 In addition, as the number of genes in a gene family increases, the number of tissues in which the corresponding gene is expressed decreases.26 However, these findings were based on the analysis of only two parameters at a time, even though co-linearity among the three elements considered (gene evolutionary rate, gene duplication, and gene expression breadth) is also possible.To analyse the involvement of duplicated genes on tissue evolution, we initially focused on the relationship between gene expression breadth and gene duplication. However, the percentages of singletons (Fig. 1D, green) and duplicated genes (Fig. 1D; red + blue) remained nearly constant at 30–35 and 65–70%, respectively, and were independent of gene expression breadth. This result suggests that the association between gene expression breadth and gene duplication is not as simple as reported previously.The present study not only considered the analysis of gene evolutionary rates but also incorporated into it the distinction between SSD genes and ohnologues when considering gene duplication. Gene evolutionary rates were fast and slow for SSD genes and ohnologues, respectively (Table 1). Interestingly, SSD genes were represented in a larger proportion within narrow expression ranges, whereas the opposite was observed for ohnologues (Fig. 1D). The present study is therefore the first to show co-linearity among gene evolutionary rate, duplication, and expression breadth.4.2. Contribution of SSD genes, ohnologues, and singletons to expression breadths in tissuesGenes that are expressed in a narrow range of tissues are considered to play significant roles in the establishment of the characteristic features of the corresponding tissues. Prior studies have shown that those genes that are expressed specifically in neural tissues evolve more slowly, whereas those expressed in other tissue types evolve faster.18,23 Alternatively, a substantial proportion of those genes with a tissue-specific expression tend to encode secreted polypeptides irrespective of tissue types, and there are few such genes in neural tissues.24In this study, we also examined if the nature of SSD genes depended on the type of tissue in which the corresponding genes were expressed. To this end, the evolutionary rate of a tissue was defined as the average <U+03C9> value of those genes expressed in that tissue, whereas the nature of the expressed genes was evaluated by their <U+03C9> values, proportions as well as by the product of these parameters. These parameters were calculated for each type of gene (SSD, ohnologues, and singletons) and plotted for each tissue (Fig. 2). Among genes with a narrow spectrum of expression, SSD genes (and singletons) played a minor role in slowly evolving tissues with low <U+03C9> values. However, the evolutionary rates as well as the proportion of SSD genes were associated positively with the evolutionary rates of tissues. Thus, SSD genes (and singletons) seemed to play major roles in fast evolving tissues with high <U+03C9> values, indicating that the relative contribution of SSD genes differs substantially depending on the type of tissue in which the gene is expressed. In contrast, genes with a wide spectrum of expression are presumed to maintain basic cellular functions irrespective of the tissue type. Among these genes, the relative contribution of SSD genes and ohnologues was similar.Our results indicate that ohnologues with slower rates of evolution and wide expression ranges are associated with slowly evolving tissues, whereas SSD genes with faster rates of evolution and narrow range of expression are associated with fast evolving tissues. Specifically, there were less ohnologues and more SSD genes in endodermal tissues such as the digestive tract. These tissues face the outer environment directly and therefore they may differentiate functionally and pleiotropically to adjust to environmental changes. Rapid tissue evolutionary rates could be therefore related to a specific mode of duplication (SSD genes) and faster molecular evolution (high <U+03C9> values) in response to this exposure to the outer environment.Conversely, in ectoderm-derived tissues, such as the nervous system, there were more ohnologues and less SSD genes. Because these tissues are not exposed to the outer environment, their evolution may not be driven by functional differentiation but rather by the need to maintain basal functions. Ohnologues with a slow evolutionary rate and lower probability of further duplication were therefore predominant in slowly evolving tissues such as the ectoderm. Mesenchymal tissues were associated with an intermediate phenotype in terms of <U+03C9> values and the proportion of ohnologues and SSD genes.Those genes with expression restricted to haemocytes exhibited very unique features. The percentage of ohnologues was the smallest among all tissue types, whereas singletons were the most representative, a result not observed for the other three tissue types. A lower proportion of conservative ohnologues might allow the relaxation of those constraints required for the formation and functionality of tissues. This flexibility might be further accelerated by an increase in the ratio of singletons. Such findings might be expected in light of the dramatic transitions of haematopoietic organs and tissues from the aorta, gonads, and mesonephros regions to the liver, spleen, and bone marrow during mammalian development and vertebrate evolution. Furthermore, the haemocytes used in this study included immune-competent cells and tissues, and immune-related genes are known to evolve fast (immunoglobulin and T cell receptor gene families were excluded from the analysis here). In this sense, endodermal tissues and haemocytes appear to adopt distinct strategies to increase the proportion of SSD genes and singletons, respectively, when adapting to environmental changes.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe work was supported by research grants from the Ministry of Education, Science, Sports, Culture and Technology of Japan and by the Creative Interdisciplinary Research Program of the Center for Interdisciplinary Research, Tohoku University, Japan.

IntroductionSymbiotic associations between plants and microorganisms have a large impact on ecosystems and plant production worldwide, and two prominent symbionts are phosphorus delivering fungi of the Glomeromycota,1 forming arbuscular mycorrhiza, and nitrogen fixing soil bacteria, rhizobia. Since the most widely used model plant Arabidopsis thaliana is unable to host these symbionts, two model legumes, Lotus japonicus and Medicago truncatula, were introduced to allow the genetic dissection of symbiotic processes.These model legumes are diploid, inbreeding species with relatively small sequenced genomes,2,3 and they have allowed the isolation of a number of genes needed for mycorrhizal and rhizobial symbiosis.4 Most of these genes were isolated through map-based cloning, but transposon and retrotransposon tagging have also been used.5,6Selection of mapping parents is important in order to establish F2 populations that allow successful causal gene identification by map-based cloning. Ideally, the number of inter-parental polymorphisms should be high, while the F2 populations should be characterized by low levels of segregation distortion and suppression of recombination. For Lotus, the first genetic maps were produced using amplified fragment length polymorphism and microsatellite markers to genotype F2 offspring. The mapping populations were established using L. japonicus Gifu as the common parent either in crosses with MG-20 and Funakura or in an interspecific cross with L. filicaulis.7–9 The level of polymorphism between L. filicaulis and Gifu is high but the F2 populations suffered from low viability and from severe segregation distortion in large genomic regions.9,10 Whereas Gifu and Funakura were genetically very similar, a relatively high level of polymorphism was found between Gifu and MG-20, and the F2 populations showed good viability combined with little segregation distortion.7 A dense linkage map with several hundred microsatellite markers was therefore developed, and most map-based cloning projects in Lotus have been based on crosses between Gifu and MG-20.2 The major disadvantage of these populations is the large translocation between the top of Gifu chromosome 1 and the bottom of MG-20 chromosome 2,7 which corresponds to a genomic region with complete suppression of recombination. In parallel with these early genetic studies, Gifu-based recombinant inbred lines (RILs) were developed from crosses with MG-20, Funakura and L. filicaulis.8,10,11To allow map-based cloning in the intervals displaying the suppression of recombination in Gifu × MG-20 populations, L. burttii originating from West Pakistan was introduced as a fourth crossing partner.12,13 Compared with MG-20 and L. filicaulis, L. burttii showed an intermediate level of polymorphism with respect to Gifu. This high marker density combined with good viability in offspring from crosses with Gifu and with the lack of suppression of recombination at the top of chromosome 1 made L. burttii a promising source of genetic material.13 Despite these favourable characteristics, Gifu × L. burttii mapping populations have been sparsely used, probably because they have not been extensively characterized. This issue can be addressed by generating and analysing RILs, since they capture and stabilize a large number of recombination events, which can be exploited for the characterization of genome structure and recombination landscapes, as well as for quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping.Here, we describe the development and genotyping of RILs derived from a Gifu × L. burttii F2 population. By analysing RIL data, we show that L. burttii is a valid alternative to MG-20 as a crossing partner to Gifu in mapping schemes, and we demonstrate that the Gifu × L. burttii RILs can be used to guide the selection of mapping parents. To illustrate the use of the RILs in QTL mapping, we investigated the nodulation of L. burttii by Sinorhizobium fredii HH103, which is a fast-growing rhizobial strain that nodulates soybean and a number of other legumes.14,15 We found that L. burttii differs from Gifu and MG-20 in forming nitrogen-fixing nodules with S. fredii HH103 and demonstrated the utility of the RILs by identifying a major Nfr1-linked QTL controlling S. fredii compatibility.2. Materials and methods2.1. RIL propagation and genotypingInbred lines of L. japonicus Gifu B-12916,17 and L. burttii B-30313 were used for crossing. Gifu ×L. burttii RILs were developed from an F2 population by selfing until F8 and F9 using single-seed descent. A total of 163 lines have reached F8.Microsatellite markers developed to detect polymorphism between Gifu and MG-202,18 were tested for polymorphism between Gifu and L. burttii (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/lotus/markerdb_index.html). Additional markers were developed for sequenced transformation competent artificial chromosome and bacterial artificial chromosome clones by searching for microsatellite sequences with the help of WebSat.19 Newly developed markers are listed in Supplementary Table S7. The markers were either analysed on 2–3% agarose gels or using an ABI3730 48 capillary sequencer (Applied Biosystems) in conjunction with the proprietary GeneMapper software (version 3.7) using fluorescently labelled primers. One hundred and forty-six lines were scored with 97 microsatellite markers distributed across all six chromosomes (Supplementary Table S1).2.2. Analysis of RIL data and QTL mappingThe RIL genotyping data presented in Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 were imported into R/qtl20 version 1.21–2 (read.cross), converted to RIL format (convert2riself), and recombination fraction and logarithm of odds (LOD) scores plotted (plot.rf; Fig. 1A and B). For the QTL analysis, the genetic map was estimated (est.map and replace.map) and missing genotype values extrapolated (mqmaugment). QTL scans were then conducted using 1000 permutations to determine significance thresholds (mqmpermutation) and plotted (mqmplot.permutations).

Physical distances per recombination fraction were then calculated (Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). To avoid inflated values during plotting (Fig. 1C), a minimum recombination fraction of 0.004 was used.2.3. Nodulation assaysSeeds were germinated and plants grown on 1/4 B&D medium as described.23Sinorhizobium fredii HH103 was grown in YMB medium for 2 days and then diluted to an OD600 of 0.01–0.02 before inoculating with 400 µl per plant by pipetting the suspension directly onto the root. The nodulation phenotype was scored 6 weeks post-inoculation.3. Results and discussion3.1. Generation and genotyping of 163 Gifu × L. burttii RILsCharacterization of populations derived from crosses between Gifu and L. burtti is required to promote the exploitation of the high level of Gifu/L. burttii polymorphism for genetic mapping. For this purpose, and to provide the legume community with a stable genetic resource for QTL and recombination rate analysis, Gifu × L. burttii RILs were generated by selfing. Starting from 200 F2 plants, 163 lines have reached generations 8 or 9. One hundred and forty-six of these lines were genotyped by scoring 97 microsatellite markers (Supplementary Table S1),2 and a Gifu × L. burttii genetic map, syntenic to the Gifu × MG-20 map,2,7 was constructed (Supplementary Table S1). The RILs have been deposited at LegumeBase, Miyazaki, Japan, where they are available for the scientific community (http://www.legumebase.brc.miyazaki-u.ac.jp/). The genotypes of the Gifu × MG-20 RILs can be found at ftp://ftp.kazusa.or.jp/pub/lotus/RIline/ and in Supplementary Table S2.3.2. Gifu × L. burttii and Gifu × MG-20 mapping crosses yield complementary informationTo assess whether Gifu × L. burttii populations would offer genetic resolution in chromosomal regions where the suppression of recombination is prominent in populations derived from crosses between Gifu and MG-20, we compared recombination landscapes based on RIL genotyping data. Analysing the pairwise recombination fractions and LOD scores for all marker combinations in the Gifu × MG-20 RILs resulted in a clear marker linkage signal at the previously described Gifu/MG-20 translocation between chromosomes 1 and 2 (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S3).7 This signal was absent in the Gifu × L. burttii RIL data (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table S4), confirming previous observations.13 However, markers at the top of chromosome 1 and the bottom of chromosome 4 appeared linked in the Gifu × L. burttii population, suggesting an altered L. burttii chromosomal structure in this region (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Table S4).To investigate if these differences in the genome structure were reflected in differential recombination rates, the genotyping markers were anchored on the MG-20 release 2.5 genome assembly, and physical distance per recombination fraction was calculated and plotted (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Tables S5 and S6).Both a relatively high inter-marker distance and an incomplete genome assembly contribute to the uncertainty of this analysis, and conclusions should be drawn with care. We did, however, observe a higher recombination rate in the Gifu × L. burttii population than in the Gifu × MG20 population (Fig. 1C) in the genomic interval located at the top of chromosome 1 in the MG-20 reference sequence, as noted previously.13 A higher recombination frequency for the Gifu × L. burttii population was also found in the sym10 region near the top of chromosome 4. On the other hand, this population appeared to suffer from suppression of recombination in the central part of chromosome 1, but not in the chromosome 1 and 4 regions displaying the marker linkage. Overall, it appears that the two populations show comparable levels of recombination and that the recombination frequency varies significantly with both genomic location and population. In addition, the Gifu × L. burttii cross showed a balanced segregation of genotypes, except for the central region of chromosome 2 (Fig. 1D). In conclusion, L. burttii appears to be a valid alternative to MG-20 as a Gifu crossing partner for generating Lotus mapping populations.3.3. Mapping of the symbiotic mutant sym10 demonstrates the utility of RIL-guided selection of mapping parentsFine-mapping of the sym10 locus located on chromosome 4 near 10 cM10 has proved challenging using a Gifu × MG-20 population, as no recombination events could be detected between the flanking markers TM1237 and TM0326 in a total of 977 individuals. This limited the mapping resolution to ~600 kb. The Gifu × L. burttii RILs documented here represent a genetic resource, which can be used to test the applicability of a mapping cross in a given genomic region. For the sym10 region, the high local rate of recombination indicated by the RIL data suggested that a Gifu × L. burttii population could be used to increase genetic mapping resolution (Fig. 1C).Motivated by this result, we generated and genotyped a sym10 × L. burttii mapping population. Although 977 individuals from the sym10 × MG-20 population allowed us to narrow down the candidate region to ~600 kb, the 696 individuals from the sym10 × L. burttii population provided additional information, limiting the candidate region to ~300 kb (Fig. 2). sym10 mapping resolution with crosses to L. japonicus MG-20 and L. burttii.

The number of informative recombinants is shown in the cross(es) where the marker is polymorphic. The delimited size of the sym10 region is shown for the two crosses individually and with the combined mapping information.In this case, the high recombination rate in the region of interest suggested by the RIL data was reflected in the F2 mapping population, leading to increased genetic resolution when combining information from the two populations. We propose that taking advantage of the RIL resources to probe recombination frequencies in genomic regions of interest prior to the selection of the mapping partner for F2 fine-mapping populations could allow faster mapping progress in a number of cases.High-throughput sequencing of bulked mapping populations generated either by interspecies or by back-crosses has proved effective in identifying causal ethyl methanesulfonate (EMS) mutations.24,25 For the sequencing analysis of interspecies crosses, marker density and recombination frequencies remain important parameters, and selecting the optimal mapping population cross is still important. Deep sequencing back-crossing methods also require genetic mapping information, and the induced EMS mutations have been used as markers in place of interspecies polymorphisms.25 A number of interesting symbiotic mutants in Lotus are not generated by EMS mutagenesis but rather by unknown genomic changes induced by tissue culture regeneration,26 and accurate genetic mapping information remains critical for identifying these causal mutations.3.4. A major QTL near Nfr1 controls S. fredii compatibilityIn addition to facilitating the choice of mapping crosses for the identification of causal mutations, the genotyped Gifu × L. burttii RILs should also be well suited for exploiting Lotus natural variation to identify genetic determinants of a wide range of traits through QTL analysis.Since we had observed a clear difference in nodulation with S. fredii HH103 between L. burttii and Gifu (Fig. 3), we chose this trait as an example for QTL analysis and proceeded to record the S. fredii nodulation phenotype of all RILs. Twenty plants were scored per line, and the trait was quantified as the ‘average number of pink nodules per plant’. S. fredii infection phenotypes for L. burttii and Gifu.

One was present near the marker TM0002, which is closely linked to the Nod factor receptor Nfr1,27 and another was found at the bottom of chromosome 4 near marker TM0617 (Fig. 4A). Further, a minor peak was seen at the top of chromosome 5. Rerunning the QTL analysis including the markers corresponding to the three highest peaks as cofactors eliminated the peak on chromosome 4 (Fig. 4B), indicating that it was an artefact caused by marker linkage between the top of chromosome 1 and the bottom of chromosome 4 (Fig. 1B). The vast majority of the phenotypic variation, therefore, appeared to be explained by the QTL on chromosome 1 near Nfr1. QTL analysis of S. fredii nodulation.

In contrast to the Nfr5-dependent host-range extension shown for L. filicaulis previously,28 the Nfr5 locus does not seem to influence the interaction between L. burttii and S. fredii.The present set of Gifu × L. burttii RILs expands both the genotypic and the phenotypic space available to Lotus researchers and promises to deliver new insight into the genetic mechanisms governing natural variation in rhizobial–legume interactions. In addition, the RIL population displays variation in flower colour, leaf shape, flowering time, and pod shattering, making it well suited for QTL mapping of these traits.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available online atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by Danish National Research Foundation, project number P07-CVI-02506 of the Andalusia Government and Kazusa DNA Research Institute Foundation.We are grateful to F.

IntroductionDetermining the genetic underpinnings of organismal divergence and speciation will provide insight into the evolutionary generation of biodiversity, and next-generation sequencing is propelling such studies in non-model organisms.1,2 An effective way to initiate genomic-wide data sets in non-model organisms is to focus on the transcriptome, or expressed sequence, which, unlike a whole-genome approach, increases the data's focus on functional genomic attributes.3,4 As these data become available, evolutionary biologists will be able to make contrasts within and among lineages to identify genes associated with divergence.5–8 To gain insight into the genes associated with avian diversification, we examine the transcriptome of the song sparrow (Melospiza melodia) and contrast it with the model birds zebra finch (Taeniopygia guttata) and chicken (G. gallus).The song sparrow is broadly distributed across North America and exhibits pronounced morphological variation, with 25 subspecies recognized (of 52 described9). It has been extensively studied over the past 70 yrs; it is considered a model vertebrate species for field research; and it will continue to be a focus for questions about the causes of population variation in behaviour, demographics, and morphology.10 Our goals in this study were to (i) obtain a functional annotation of a substantial portion of the song sparrow transcriptome; (ii) compare transcript divergence between the song sparrow and the two bird genomes sequenced and assembled to the highest quality thus far, zebra finch (T. guttata) and chicken (G. gallus); (iii) efficiently characterize a set of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)/indel markers that may be fixed between song sparrow subspecies; and (iv) identify the most common set of transcripts present in bird species using the zebra finch as a reference. Achieving these goals will establish important baseline data for a non-model organism in a speciose group (passerines or songbirds) frequently studied.2. Materials and methods2.1. Samples, cDNA library, and sequencingTwo song sparrows still undergoing growth (from embryo to just-fledged) were sampled from each of three Alaska populations (the northwestern most distribution of the species), chosen because they span some of the most pronounced morphological diversity that occurs in the species (Fig. 1): two island populations of M. m. maxima (from Attu and Adak islands; an egg and a very young nestling from Attu Island, unvouchered; and vouchers UAM 27831 and 27832 from Adak Island) and one mainland population of M. m. caurina (from Cordova, vouchers UAM 27829 and 27830). The Attu and Adak populations of Melospiza m. maxima are the largest in the species and also have different plumage coloration; in addition, they are non-migratory, unlike the population from Cordova, which is also smaller and darker (Fig. 1). Samples in this study came from Cordova (Melospiza melodia caurina, right in inset) and Adak and Attu islands (M. m. maxima, left in inset); grey shading indicates the species' range.Samples in this study came from Cordova (Melospiza melodia caurina, right in inset) and Adak and Attu islands (M. m. maxima, left in inset); grey shading indicates the species' range.All samples were obtained in June (spring) at a very young age and only two were sexable (both females, one each from Cordova and Adak). The egg was homogenized, whereas from the others six tissues (brain, liver, heart, muscle, bone, and pancreas) were taken, minced and placed in RNAlater (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) within minutes of death and then frozen. In the laboratory, tissues were homogenized and total RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and subsequently cleaned using a Qiagen RNeasy column.Equal amounts of RNA from individuals of each population were pooled and an MINT universal cDNA kit (Evrogen, Moscow, Russia) with primers modified specifically for 454 procedures11 was used to create cDNA libraries enriched for full-length transcripts. We then normalized the three cDNA libraries using the TRIMMER cDNA normalization kit (Evrogen) to substantially decrease the relative abundance of common transcripts. The normalized cDNA was fragmented and prepared for sequencing using standard 454 procedures, including independent molecular identifiers [MID tags: Cordova (MID 13), Attu (MID 18) and Adak (MID 19)] for each of the three populations. As each library contained a unique MID tag, libraries were pooled and sequenced as a single sample. Sequencing was performed at the University of Georgia's Georgia Genomics Facility on a Roche 454 FLX using Titanium chemistry.2.2. Assembly, polymorphism, and ortholog identificationBases were called from the 454-generated sff file using Pyrobayes,12 which provides improved accuracy in the estimation of base qualities for pyrosequences. We removed MINT primer sequences, short sequences, and other contaminatants using SeqClean (http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu), and reads from all three populations were combined. We performed a combined assembly of reads using MIRA,13 and then used GigaBayes,14 a short-read SNP and short indel discovery program, to detect polymorphisms. To make the SNP/indel predictions more reliable, we used the more stringent criteria that the minor allele must occur at least three times and be present at =10% relative to the major allele frequency when >30 reads per locus were obtained (after combining all the reads for particular alleles among different subspecies; sequences with fewer reads are considered the minor allele and sequences with more reads are considered the major allele). We identified orthologous contigs (against the zebra finch and chicken genomes) using the reciprocal blast approach, because it has been found to be superior to sophisticated orthology detection algorithms.15 A stringent cutoff of 1e-20 was used to separate paralogues from orthologues. The cDNA sequences from the zebra finch (taeGut3.2.4.60.cdna.all.fa) and chicken (WASHUC2.60.cdna.all.fa) were obtained from the Biomart database (www.biomart.org). Although the zebra finch is a passerine and thus more closely related to the song sparrow, the chicken database contains sequences from whole growing chicks, whereas that of the zebra finch emphasizes neural transcripts.To identify likely genomic positions of the song sparrow contigs, we mapped them against genomic sequences of the zebra finch (taeGut3.2.4.60.dna_rm.toplevel.fa) and chicken (WASHUC2.60.dna_rm.toplevel.fa) using BLAT16 with default criteria. We obtained feature information for protein-coding genes and ncRNA using the Ensemble (http://uswest.ensembl.org/index.html/) Xenoref and gtf files, respectively.2.3. Most common set of transcripts in birdsTo find the most common set of transcripts in birds with respect to zebra finch, we collected and assembled (454 GS assembler version 2.5) the transcriptome sequence of 12 bird species (publicly available sequence5,7,8,17). The orthologous sequence with respect to zebra finch was determined using the bidirectional blast best hit method (1e-20). Only contigs >200 bp were used in the analysis. After determining the orthologous sequences, we sorted them in decreasing order and added orthologous sequences from other species sequentially to find the most common set.2.4. Functional annotation of contigsWe used Blast2GO18 (B2G) to functionally annotate the contigs. A combined graph was generated for each gene ontology (GO) category. For the molecular function division, a graph was obtained using default criteria and for the other two divisions (cellular component and biological process), seq/node filter values were changed to 4/10 to prevent overloading the graphs.2.5. Estimation of substitution ratesSubstitution rates were estimated for contigs that were orthologous to both zebra finch and chicken. Reading frames for these contigs were identified using BLASTX19 against protein sequences of zebra finch (taeGut3.2.4.60.pep.all.fa) and chicken (WASHUC2.60.pep.all.fa) obtained from Biomart (www.biomart.org). Sequences that produced significant alignments were extracted (using their coordinates), translated, and aligned using CLUSTALW.20 Sequences that contained frame shifts were excluded from the analysis. Corresponding codon alignments were produced using PAL2NAL,21 and, finally, rates were estimated using a maximum likelihood method implemented in the CODEML program of the PAML package Version 4.1.22 Pairwise maximum likelihood analyses were performed in runmode-2. The estimated rates of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions (Ka/Ks values) were plotted as a scatter plot in the range of 0–2.0.3. Results and discussion3.1. Sequence assemblyThe pooled reads from all three populations yielded 131 Mb (458 808 sequences) of raw data, which was reduced to 110Mb (381 474 sequences) after the use of SeqClean (Table 1). The mean raw and cleaned read lengths were 286 and 290 bp, respectively. Poor-quality reads were often very short and were purged entirely prior to assembly. Without a reference genome for the song sparrow, de novo assembly was required. Cleaned sequences were assembled into 38 539 contigs with N50 and N90 values of 482 and 317 bp, respectively (Supplementary data). There were 1417 singletons. The mean coverage per contig was 3.93 X and the mean GC content per contig was 43.6%.

A large number of tissues were sampled, and these clearly contain a large and diverse set of transcripts (see Section 3.2). Simulations indicate that transcriptomes sequenced with 454 Titanium chemistry will quickly lead to about twice as many contigs as transcripts, and additional sequences only gradually cause the number of contigs to reach the number of transcripts (i.e. the point when contigs = transcripts; data not shown). Thus, quite large numbers of additional sequences will be necessary to fully assemble the transcripts contained in these cDNA libraries. Given the relatively high cost of 454 sequencing, it would be more economical to obtain the additional sequences as paired-end reads on Illumina or Ion Torrent platforms.3.2. Functional annotationB2G, which we used to functionally annotate the contigs, has three annotation steps involving (i) a blast against databases, (ii) mapping against GO resources, and (iii) annotation to generate reliable functional assignments. In our data, 12 880 of the contigs (33.46% overall, of which 8540 were unique hits) had significant matches to currently known proteins in the NCBI non-redundant protein database. Because one-third of the contigs hit the same proteins as other contigs in our data, this indicates that large transcripts were often split among multiple contigs in our assembly. Although it is possible to use the zebra finch or chicken proteins as a reference to scaffold the song sparrow contigs, we did not do this because it could make chimeras, and assembly of full-length genes was not a major goal of this work.As expected, zebra finch and chicken were identified as the top two species with the best blast hits for our song sparrow contigs (Table 2). Contigs with significant blast matches were functionally annotated. GO resource assignment was found for 3949 (10.2%) of the total contigs (with 24 363 GO terms; there can be multiple terms per contig), of which 3367 (8.7% of all contigs) were functionally annotated (Supplementary Sheet 1). Species with =100 top hits from B2GSpecies with =100 top hits from B2GIn the first GO division, ‘biological process’,23 22 categories were identified. Most contigs (3578 = 53.1%) were involved in ‘cellular and metabolic processes’. The second most abundant category was ‘biological regulation and localization’ (1253 = 18.6%; Supplementary Fig. S1A). Within the second division, ‘molecular function’,23 nine major categories were identified. Most of the contigs were functionally related to ‘nucleotide binding’ (1966 = 43.9%) and ‘catalytic activity’ (1266 28.2%; Supplementary Fig. S1B). Finally, the last division, ‘cellular component’,23 also had nine categories. Gene products were primarily expressed intracellularly (2322 = 41.9%) or in the membrane bound/non-membrane bound organelle (1787 = 32.3%; Supplementary Fig. S1C).All of the GO results should be viewed with caution because the depth of the available sequences ensures that most highly expressed transcripts will have been sequenced but many low-expression transcripts will not have been detected. The normalization techniques used substantially increased the number of low-expression transcripts sequenced, but the number of sequences obtained is insufficient to overcome the bias toward highly expressed transcripts.3.3. Polymorphism detectionWe detected a total of 29 982 SNPs/indels that were spread relatively evenly within, between, and among all three populations (Fig. 2, Supplementary Sheet 2). A total of 1402 SNPs/indels were fixed between populations and subspecies (Fig. 3; the sum of all pairwise comparisons is 1635 because some pairwise SNPs are found in more than one pair). Out of the 1402, there were 392 and 410 SNPs/indels between subspecies and within-subspecies, respectively. This provides many SNPs/indels for further study (Supplementary Sheet 2), although given our limited sampling of individuals within populations (n = 2) many will not be true fixed differences (i.e. they are false positives, other individuals contain these variants). We also note that we have used quite stringent criteria for SNP/indel assignment. By requiring at least three reads for the minor allele, a minimum of six times coverage is required to call a SNP. Because our average assembly depth is only about four times, most polymorphic nucleotides in our contigs will not pass our criteria for SNP discovery. Because of this, we have biased the SNPs to be from the relatively highly expressed transcripts. Many additional SNPs/indels occur in song sparrows, we describe only those with a high probability of being real, not sequencing artefacts. None of these issues limits our ability to achieve our stated goals, but we note them so that it is understood that we have made appropriately cautious interpretations of our results.

Orthology with zebra finch and chickenThe reciprocal blast approach identified 4574 contigs as orthologous to both zebra finch and chicken. As expected because of phylogenetic relationships, more contigs were identified as orthologous to the zebra finch than the chicken: the set [unique song sparrow (orthologues) unique zebra finch] was [32 435 (6104) 12 493], whereas the set [unique song sparrow (orthologues) unique chicken] was [32 767 (5772) 16 518]. A substantial number of orthologous contigs (3894) were found to have the same chromosome location in the zebra finch and chicken (Supplementary Sheet 1).3.5. Localization of contigsThe zebra finch and chicken genomes were used as references to locate the contigs. BLAT mapping of our assemblies against these genomes showed sequences that uniquely mapped to particular features of the reference genomes [5'UTR (untranslated region), 3'UTR, CDS (coding sequence), 1 kb upstream, 1 kb downstream; Fig. 4A]. Based on the zebra finch genome annotation, nearly 34% of mapped contigs (2890 of 8561) were found to be in CDS regions. Even with the use of the MINT cDNA construction kit, which is meant only to allow amplification of full-length transcripts, we still observed a substantial bias toward contigs mapping to 3'UTR and 1 kb downstream _relative to 5'UTR and 1 kb upstream. The normalized distributions clearly indicate that our libraries contain relatively few transcripts that are full length (Fig. 4B). Similar patterns, although with slightly fewer hits, were obtained from mapping to the chicken genome. The localization of contigs containing SNPs/indels mapped against the zebra finch and chicken genomes showed that a major proportion of polymorphisms belongs to coding sequences (Supplementary Fig. S2A and B). Contigs with SNPs/indels had more blast hits to the zebra finch than to the chicken, reflecting the overall pattern of all contigs. Few RNA genes were also found by BLAT mapping (Supplementary Fig. S3A and B).

The upper panel displays the raw count and the lower panel normalized values (the proportion discovered relative to how many could be discovered within each category).3.6. Common set transcripts in birdsWe determined the orthologous transcripts with respect to zebra finch using the bidirectional blast best hit method in 12 bird species. From the orthologous sequences, we determined the most common set of transcripts of zebra finch which is present in all species or most of the species. The first big set of transcripts (1004 zebra finch sequences) was present in seven bird species. The second largest set comprised 219 and 126 sequences present in 10 and 12 bird species, respectively, and, finally, 19 sequences were present in all 13 species. Detailed information regarding species used and orthologous sequences is given in the Supplementary Sheet 3. Further, we checked the pathways in which these common transcripts might be involved using DAVID24,25 and found that they mainly related to oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome biogenesis, and cardiac muscle contraction. These are housekeeping genes26,27 which explains the frequent occurrence of these in all avian species. With respect to the chromosomal location of common transcripts, we did not find any significant bias related to any particular chromosome.3.7. Estimation of Ka/KsSubstitution rates were estimated for the 4574 contigs orthologous to both zebra finch and chicken. After filtering (based on the length of alignment and removing frame shifts), the number of contigs was reduced to 3821. We excluded contigs that were either identical or which had Ks = 0 (which made Ka/Ks incalculable). Thus, Ka/Ks was estimated for 3252 (zebra finch) and 3127 (chicken) contigs. Rate estimation with zebra finch identified 43 contigs with Ka/Ks =1 and 283 with values of 0.5–1.0 (Fig. 5A). Rate estimations with chicken yielded 5 and 58 contigs with Ka/Ks =1 and between 0.5 and 1.0, respectively (Fig. 5B). Afterwards, assuming the song sparrow contigs have the same chromosome organization as zebra finch and chicken, the calculated ratios were organized into chromosomes (Table 3); this is not an unrealistic assumption considering the high degree of chromosomal conservation among avian genomes28,29 and the fact that such a high proportion (85.1%) of our orthologous contigs was found to have shared chromosomal locations with zebra finch and chicken.

Contigs with Ka/Ks values of 0.5–1.0 fall above the grey line and values >1.0 fall above the black line.Although Ka/Ks (sometimes calculated as dN/dS or <U+03C9>) is commonly misinterpreted,30 this ratio of rates of non-synonymous to synonymous substitutions can give some context to candidate genes and allows for subsequent hypothesis testing.31,32 Data organized into chromosomes suggest that contigs may have undergone more selection with respect to the zebra finch than the chicken (as high Ka/Ks values are typically interpreted, though see ref. 30).The fact that Ka/Ks values were higher on average for the zebra finch than for the chicken (Table 3) is likely a methodological artefact. The zebra finch is in the same taxonomic order as the song sparrow (Passeriformes), whereas the chicken is taxonomically distant (Galliformes). Estimates of <U+03C9> necessarily classify sites with differences as non-synonymous or synonymous, and errors in the estimation of either can profoundly affect the outcome of these analyses.33 Taxonomic or lineage distance (longer branches) will affect the reconstruction of synonymous substitution rates especially (through an expected increase in repeated mutations, or multiple hits), and we consider this to be a likely source of the consistent differences in apparent molecular selection between our song-sparrow-to-zebra-finch and song-sparrow-to-chicken contrasts (Table 3; see also ref. 34). Nevertheless, these contrasts are valuable in highlighting the chromosomal distributions (assuming chromosomal stability28) and relative values of <U+03C9> between closer and more distant relatives of the song sparrow, providing insights into attributes of selection in the coding genome across these scales. Unfortunately, this approach is not valid within species.35–37Chromosomes 22 and 26 showed the greatest differences between the zebra finch and the chicken in the percentage of song sparrow contigs mapped (relative to the number of genes available in the Biomart database for the zebra finch and chicken). Both of these chromosomes had significantly different frequencies of mapped-song-sparrow versus Biomart data-available genes between the zebra finch and the chicken (Gadj = 4.4, P< 0.05, and Gadj = 6.9, P< 0.01, respectively at 1 d.f., G-test with Williams' correction; Table 3). In both cases, proportionally more contigs were mapped to the zebra finch than to the chicken given the sizes of the respective databases (Table 3).3.8. Chromosomal distributions of between-subspecies SNPs/indelsTwo findings emerged in comparing the among-chromosome locations (mapped against the zebra finch) of the between-subspecies SNPs/indels that were mapped to chromosomes (218 SNP/indel-bearing, between-subspecies song sparrow contigs; Supplementary Sheet 2) versus all orthologous song sparrow contigs (Table 3). First, the chromosomal distribution of the candidate loci was significantly different from the distribution of all orthologous contigs (Gadj = 51.5, 27 d.f., P< 0.005), indicative of a non-random process (e.g. selection). Importantly, the chromosomal distribution of the 199 unique, mappable SNP/indel-bearing contigs between Attu and Adak islands (within the subspecies maxima), where we expected drift rather than selection to be more pronounced, was not significantly different from the chromosomal distribution of all orthologous contigs (Gadj = 35.1, 27 d.f., P> 0.1). Secondly, the greatest differences in the distribution of between-subspecies candidate loci from the distribution of all contigs occurred among chromosomes 2, 5, and Z (where proportionally fewer SNP/indel-bearing contigs occurred than expected) and chromosomes 3 and 11 (where relatively more SNP/indel-bearing contigs occurred than expected).Finally, in contrasting our between-subspecies results with those of our between-species comparisons above, we found that seven of the SNP/indel-bearing contigs between subspecies were also contigs that exhibited evidence suggestive of selection (high Ka/Ks values) when compared with the zebra finch and the chicken. Each contig has one between-subspecies SNP, and the functions of these loci are variable (Supplementary Sheet 4). Three of these seven occurred on chromosome 3 and one on chromosome 11, where the between-subspecies contrasts suggested elevated levels of SNPs/indels. These contigs and their chromosomal locations may thus be important in songbird divergence, but we do not yet know why.3.9. SummaryIn summary, our analysis identified the major categories of song sparrow genes and orthologous loci between song sparrow/zebra finch and song sparrow/chicken. Substitution rate estimation yielded the fastest evolving loci, and some of the loci that were fixed between subspecies were also highlighted as possibly under selection between the song sparrow and the zebra finch. Although additional sequencing of these libraries and validation of within-species SNPs/indels in multiple populations and lineages is required, we consider that the loci described here will include some of broad utility for studying the genomics of songbird divergence.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study was supported in part by resources and technical expertise from the University of Georgia, Georgia Advanced Computing Resource Center, a partnership between the Office of the Vice President for Research and the Office of the Chief Information Office.We thank NSF Alaska EPSCoR (EPS-0701898) and the University of Alaska Museum for supporting this research.

IntroductionCassava, Manihot esculenta Crantz, is a tropical crop that is important for food security and income generation for many poor farmers in several Asian and African countries. More than 240 million tons of cassava are produced per year, and cassava serves as the primary food source for >750 million people. Cassava is one of the most efficient producers of carbohydrates and energy among all the food crops.1 Cassava is known for its adaptability to different soils and environmental conditions, particularly for its tolerance to drought. Cassava can withstand short and longest period of drought of around 4–6 months.2 The drought stress response in cassava is followed by dehydration avoidance through deep root system, closure of stomata in dry air, and shedding of older leaves in which these features are effective for survival under drought conditions. Upon recovery from water stress, cassava rapidly regenerates new leaves and leaf area index becomes higher compared with non-stressed plants.3Partial sequencing of cDNA clones has been used as an effective method for gene discovery and in the last decade, the development of several EST collections has led to functional genomics studies in several plant species.4,5 Large-scale cassava EST sequencing projects have been performed in various cassava research groups.2,6,7 Sakurai et al. constructed a full-length cDNA enriched library from cassava leaves and roots subjected to drought, heat, and acidic stress treatments, as well as from roots subjected to post-harvest physiological deterioration (PPD), a major obstacle for cassava commercialization.8 The cassava genome sequence is now publicly available and the initial assembly spans 419.5 Mb, covering 54% of the estimated cassava genome size (770 Mb).9 At present, 30 666 protein-coding genes have been predicted from the genome sequence and 3485 alternative splice forms have been supported by the ESTs.9Microarray technology has demonstrated the power of high-throughput approaches to unravel key biological processes and identify useful candidate genes and promoters for genetic engineering.10–12 In cassava, a cDNA microarray containing ~5700 unique cassava cDNA sequences has been prepared and used for studying expression profiles in response to Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. manihotis infection and during the PPD response.13,14 Oligo-DNA microarrays are gradually gaining importance due to the number of genes contained on each microarray, easier management of the system, and a greater dynamic range in the evaluation of expression levels.15,16 Recently, Yang et al.17 prepared an Agilent 60-mer oligo microarray representing ~20 000 genes and applied this microarray to study the expression profile of cassava genes during the tuberization process. Although previous studies using cassava microarrays have provided valuable transcriptome information towards cassava molecular breeding, no reports on the cassava microarray studies under drought stress have been reported and only one genotype was used in the previous microarray studies.More than 6500 cassava germplasm accessions with varying phenotypes for biomass, abiotic stress tolerance, and resistance to harmful pathogens are available from the Genetic Resources Program of CIAT (http://isa.ciat.cgiar.org/urg/).18 Therefore, it is necessary to develop a cassava microarray that can be applied to various cassava genotypes that is essential for identifying useful genes for genetic engineering and advancing molecular breeding in cassava.In this study, we used three useful cassava genotypes: MTAI16 (also called KU50), MECU72, and MPER417-003. The detailed information for the three genotypes is shown in Section 2. Here we apply our newly developed cassava oligomicroarray to study the expression profile under drought stress and report that our cassava oligomicroarray can be used for analysing the cassava transcriptome in various cassava genotypes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and drought stress treatmentThe three cassava genotypes for the microarray analysis were used: (i) MTAI16 (also known as KU50), which is one of the most important cassava genotype (M. esculenta Crantz), especially in Southeast Asia (including Thailand). It was developed through cross-breeding between Rayong 1 and Rayong 90 by breeders of the Kasetsart University, Department of Agriculture, Ministry of Agriculture and CIAT, and released officially in 1993 (http://www.tapiocathai.org/English/K2_e.html). It has high root yield, high starch content in root tubers, and vigorous plant growth with wide adaptability to unfavourable environmental conditions19,20. (ii) MECU72, a naturally occurring cassava genotype (M. esculenta Crantz) with whitefly (Aleurotrachelus socialis) resistance and was isolated in Ecuador and (iii) MPER417-003, a wild landrace of M. esculenta subsp. peruviana, which shows resistance to whitefly and mealybug (Phenococcus herreni). MTAI16 and MECU72 might be closely related, because they are classified as the same species. Previous polymorphism studies using AFLP and RAPD markers reported that the mean genetic similarity between M. esculenta and M. peruviana was 0.59, suggesting that M. esculenta and M. peruviana are closely related when compared with between M. esculenta and other wild species.21,22 Previously, the impact of water stress on yield and quality of cassava starch was studied in six varieties and this study indicated that MTAI16 recovered quickly from water stress and also had high starch content under recovery after drought stress compared with other varieties studied.19 No studies on drought stress tolerance in MECU72 and MPER417-003 have been reported.The preparation of in vitro cassava plantlets was performed as follows: after plantlets were sterilized with 1% sodium hypochlorite solution, the plantlet was transferred to a glass pot with Murashige and Skoog (MS) media (pH5.8) containing 20 g/l sucrose, 4.4 g/l MS salts containing vitamins (Duchefa), 2 µM CuSO4 (Wako), and 3.0 g/l gelrite (Wako). After cutting ~2–3 cm from the shoot top of the cassava plantlets, three shoot cuttings were transferred to a glass pot with the MS media and grown under 16-h illumination of 40–80 µmol photons m-2 s-1 at 30°C. The roots were formed from the sections of the cutting shoots and the plantlets were grown until ~5 cm high during 1 month and then used as experimental materials. The phenotypes of these genotypes under non-treated conditions were very similar (Fig. 1). For the untreated control samples, the shoots were harvested and frozen in liquid nitrogen. The plantlets were also subjected to drought treatment by transferring the plantlets from the glass pot onto a plastic plate and maintaining them for 1 h under 40–80 µmol photons m-2 s-1 at 30°C in 50% relative humidity. After the drought stress treatment, all of the leaves from the three cassava genotypes wilted (Fig. 1). After removing roots from the plantlets, the shoots were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C until the RNA preparation. Three independent biological replicative experiments were performed for each treatment and each genotype as follows: (i) MTAI16 (untreated control), (ii) MTAI16 (1 h drought treatment), (iii) MECU72 (untreated control), (iv) MECU72 (1 h drought treatment), (v) MPER417-003 (untreated control), and (vi) MPER417-003 (1 h drought treatment). Phenotype of cassava genotypes after 1-h drought-stress treatment.Phenotype of cassava genotypes after 1-h drought-stress treatment.2.2. RNA extractionTotal RNA was extracted from six shoots (~800 mg fresh weight (FW)) per experiment using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer's instructions (QIAGEN). The total RNA extracts were treated with RNase-free DNase I (QIAGEN) to completely remove genomic DNA. The total RNA quality was evaluated with electrophoresis using the Bioanalyzer system (Agilent). The extracted total RNA was stored at -80°C until further use.2.3. Oligomicroarray designFigure 2 shows an overview of the development of our cassava oligomicroarray. We retrieved 76 566 ESTs and 86 cDNA (from high-throughput cDNA category) sequences from GenBank in February 2009 as starting sequences for the microarray probe design. The sequences used are derived from various cassava genotypes, such as MTAI16, CAS36.01, CAS36.04, CM21772, CM523-7, MCol22, IAC 12.829, MBra685, MCol1522, MNga2, MPer183, Mirassol, SG107-35, Sauti, Gomani, Mbundumali, TME 1, MkondeziTMS30572, and CM2177-2. Some sequences deposited in GenBank were contaminated by non-native sequences derived from cloning vectors, bacterial hosts, and other sources. In addition, abundant repetitive elements in a sequence set decreased our ability to accurately assemble the sequence. Therefore, contamination and repetitive elements in the retrieved sequences were masked via the cross match program in the Phred/Phrap package23 by using the -minmatch 10 -minscore 20 parameters and comparison with the NCBI UniVec and MSU Plant Repeat Database, respectively. Similarly, polyA and polyT sequences were also masked. We then omitted sequences that are shorter than 100 bp from the design process. In order to eliminate the sequence redundancy, the remaining sequences were assembled with the CAP3 program24 by using the -p 95 parameter. This condition is tighter than one for redundancy omission alone. All the public ESTs which were used in our assembly were not deposited as the sense strand and the contigous sequences in our assembly included antisense sequences. Therefore, we evaluated the contiguous sequences using the public protein sequence sets. The sense strands of the assembled sequences were evaluated using the BLASTX program25 against the three databases, NCBI RefSeq plant (released January 20, 2009),26 UniProt TrEMBL plant (released 3 March 2009),27 and the predicted protein sequences from poplar (JGI Poptr1_1) and castor bean genome sequences (GenBank accession numbers EQ973772–EQ999533). We identified the sequence that aligned with the three protein sequence sets with the same translation frame as the appropriate sequence for the microarray probe design. Design of the cassava oligo-DNA microarray.Design of the cassava oligo-DNA microarray.Finally, the sequences filtered through the sense direction evaluation were submitted to the eArray application (https://earray.chem.agilent.com/earray/) of Agilent Technologies (Santa Clara, CA, USA) to design the 60-mer oligomicroarray probes using ‘Best probe methodology’ and ‘Design with 3' bias’ options in order to prevent the occurrence of cross-hybridization. Note that only 2.6 and 0.6% had >80 and 90%, respectively, similarity with other probes on the array (Supplementary Table S1). About 60% of the probes had >1-bp overlap with the structural portion of genes. Sixty probes are added as non-plant or negative/positive control sequences on the array. The information is available at the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO), accession number GPL14139.2.4. Microarray hybridizationCyanine-3 (Cy3)-labeled cRNA was prepared from 0.5 µg of total RNA using the Quick Amp Labeling kit (Agilent Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions (http://www.chem.agilent.com/Library/usermanuals/Public/G4140-90040_GeneExpression_One-color_v6.5.pdf), followed by RNeasy column purification (Qiagen). Dye incorporation and cRNA yield were checked with the NanoDrop ND-1000 Spectrophotometer. The Cy3-labelled cRNA (1.65 µg) was fragmented at 60°C for 30 min according to the manufacturer's instructions. Agilent hybridization buffer was then added to the fragmentation mixture and hybridized to the Agilent microarray (GPL14139) for 17 h at 65°C in a rotating Agilent hybridization oven. After hybridization, the microarrays were washed using the optimized protocol (http://www.chem.agilent.com/Library/usermanuals/Public/G4140-90040_GeneExpression_One-color_v6.5.pdf) recommended by Agilent technologies. Slides were scanned immediately after washing on the Agilent DNA Microarray Scanner (G2505B) using one color scan setting for 4 × 44 K array slides. Signal intensities were detected from the obtained digital images using Feature Extraction software (Ver. 9.1; Agilent Technologies). Three independent biological replicative experiments were performed for each treatment and for each genotype.2.5. Microarray data analysisTotal 18 expression data obtained by microarray analysis were exported to GeneSpring GX (Agilent Technologies) and per chip normalization to the quantile expression level and per gene normalization to the median expression intensity were performed in all samples. Data were transformed into the log 2 ratio for display and analysis. The following calculations were performed according to the manufacturer's instructions of GeneSpring GX. Briefly, the microarray data were filtered to remove control probe sets and those probe sets with an intensity value close to background levels. The remaining genes were filtered based on the deviation of the intensity values within a condition. The remaining genes were placed together in one list. The genes selected in this way were further filtered to remove those probe sets whose expression change under all experimental conditions was below a threshold, based on median normalized intensity values, which was considered to be the no-change threshold. The resulting working gene list of transcripts for each experiment was used for the statistical analysis. To test for differential expression, an analysis of variance test was carried out between non-treated and drought-treated samples. The changes in gene expression were statistically analysed by the unpaired t-test (threshold was set at P< 0.01) for two groups (non-treated and drought-treated samples). The false discovery rate (q-value) was calculated for each P value according to the method of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995).28 The information from the cassava oligomicroarray is available at the GEO of NCBI. The accession numbers are Platform, GPL14139; Series, GSE31749; Samples, GSM787966–GSM787983.When the total 21 522 sequences on the array were searched by BLASTX program against 35 176 Arabidopsis protein sequence data sets in the nuclear genome. (TAIR10, ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Genes/TAIR10_genome_release/TAIR10_blastsets/TAIR10_pep_20101214), 20 436 sequences had hits with Arabidopsis proteins at E value = 1e-5. The top hits were used for gene annotations, and the corresponding AGI code was used for the functional classification using the gene ontology (GO) of TAIR10 (http://www.arabidopsis.org/tools/bulk/go/index.jsp). The percentage of the up-regulated, down-regulated, overrepresented and underrepresented genes was calculated as follows: percentage (%) = (number of the genes classified into the GO term)/(total number of the genes used for the classification).2.6. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR (qPCR) analysisFirst-strand cDNA synthesis was performed with a SuperScript® VILO™ cDNA synthesis kit (Invitrogen) using random hexamer primers. After denaturing the total RNA (2.0 µg) at 70°C for 5 min, reverse transcription was performed for 1 h at 42°C with total RNA, 4 µl of SuperScript VILO Reaction Mix, and 2 µl of SuperScript Enzyme Mix in a 20 µl total volume. The reaction was stopped by heating for 5 min at 85°C. The first-strand cDNA preparations were stored at -30°C until use. The basic procedure of qPCR was carried out on an ABI PRISM 7000 (Applied Biosystems) using a cDNA mixture corresponding to 1.5 ng of total RNA, 10 µl of Fast SYBR® green master mix (Applied Biosystems), 0.5 µM of both forward and reverse primers in a 20 µl total volume. The gene-specific primers used for qPCR are listed in Supplementary Table S2. The sequences of all primer sets were designed using the Primer 3 program (http://primer3.sourceforge.net/). The PCR cycling conditions were as follows: 95°C for 20 s, for initial denaturation followed by 45 cycles of 95°C for 5 s and 60°C for 30 s. The specificity of the PCR amplification was evaluated with a melting curve analysis (from 55°C to 95°C) of the band pattern of the amplification product after the final cycle of the PCR. Each plate also incorporated a no-template control. We employed probes specific for the ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme 4 (UBC4) gene from cassava as references. The qPCR data was analysed with the <U+0394>CT method using a reference gene. For each sample, the mRNA levels of target genes were normalized to that of the UBC4 mRNA.3. Results and discussion3.1. Cassava oligomicroarray designFor the development of the cassava oligomicroarray, we designed 60-mer oligonucleotide probes based on 76 652 cassava cDNA sequences (Fig. 2; 76 566 ESTs and 86 high-throughput cDNA sequences retrieved from GenBank in February 2009). We omitted non-native sequences derived from cloning vectors, bacterial host sequences, and sequences shorter than 100 bp. As a result of this cleaning process, the number of sequences was reduced to 76 568. In order to eliminate the sequence redundancy, the remaining sequences were assembled using the CAP3 program, which resulted in the identification of 29 636 non-redundant sequences (11 422 contigs and 18 214 singlets). We then performed a BLASTX search with the target sequences against NCBI RefSeq plant, UniProt TrEMBL plant, and the predicted protein sequences from poplar and castor bean genome sequences to evaluate the transcriptional direction, because some public ESTs were not deposited as sense strand sequences. This analysis identified 25 708 potential target sequences (average size: 853 bp) for the 60-mer probe design. To obtain more individual sequences among cassava varieties, we assembled the cassava expressed-sequences using the option p 95. We then applied the selected probes to the design via Agilent e-array (https://earray.chem.agilent.com/earray/) using ‘Best probe methodology’ and ‘Design with 3' bias’ options to prevent cross-hybridization (Fig. 2). Finally, 21 522 unique microarray probes were selected via the Agilent's eArray application. About 52% (17 753) of the total predicted cassava CDS (34 151) are supported by 21 522 probes. Please note that when we designed the cassava microarray in 2009, 18 591 cassava CDS have been supported by the ESTs and this array has the probes corresponding to 89% (16 619) of them.When the total 21 522 sequences were searched by BLASTX program against 35 176 Arabidopsis protein sequences present in the nuclear genome (TAIR10, ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Genes/TAIR10_genome_release/TAIR10_blastsets/TAIR10_pep_20101214), 20 436 sequences had hits with Arabidopsis proteins. Among them, 16 875 sequences had hits with 9748 Arabidopsis proteins at E value =1e-5. The top hits were used for gene annotation and analyses of the GO (please see below).29 Note that the percentage of the probes on the array having >80 or 90% similarity with other probes is 2.6 or 0.6, respectively (Supplementary Table S1). We then adopted the Agilent 44k oligomicroarray platform and the selected probes were duplicated in the randomized layout on the array. We have also added the 60 probes of non-plant or negative/positive control sequences on the array.Similar type of 60-mer Agilent cassava oligomicroarray has been also developed17 and applied to study the expression profiles during storage root formation in cassava. The previous studies have applied it to only one cultivar, TMS60444 and have not demonstrated that the probes on the array could hybridize with the cRNAs prepared from various cassava genotypes. Our array differs from the previous array in the following ways: (i) slightly more ESTs were used to design the array (76 566 vs. 71 520), (ii) more genes are represented on our arrays (21 522 vs. 20 840), and (iii) care was taken to examine the transcript direction on our array.3.2. Cassava oligomicroarray can be used for transcriptome analyses in various cassava genotypesWe applied the 22-k cassava oligomicroarray to study the expression profiles of three cassava genotypes, MTAI16, MECU72, and MPER417-003 under drought stress (Fig. 1) as described in Section 2. After filtering (see Section 2), the genes with the following characteristics were selected: (i) the signal intensity is higher than the local background plus 2.6 times of the standard deviation; (ii) the signal intensity is not saturated; and (iii) the spot is uniform. We adopted the Agilent standard protocol for the oligo-microarray kit in order to keep the objectivity of the statistics (http://www.genomics.agilent.com/files/Manual/G4460-90026_FE_Reference.pdf). The total numbers of valid gene probes that were identified as ‘expressed’ with the above characteristics were 16 888, 17 772, and 17 037 from MTAI16, MECU72, and MPER417-003, respectively (Table 1). These results showed that 77–83% from a total of 21 522 genes were detectable by hybridization to the cRNA from the tissues. Number of expressed genes and data reproducibility among experiments using three cassava genotypesaTotal number of the gene probes with the following characteristics in six experiments (both non-treated and drought-treated samples): (i) the signal intensity was higher than the local background plus 2.6 times of the standard deviation; (ii) the signal intensity was not saturated, and (iii) the spot is uniform.Number of expressed genes and data reproducibility among experiments using three cassava genotypesaTotal number of the gene probes with the following characteristics in six experiments (both non-treated and drought-treated samples): (i) the signal intensity was higher than the local background plus 2.6 times of the standard deviation; (ii) the signal intensity was not saturated, and (iii) the spot is uniform.To show the feasibility of our oligomicroarray for cassava genotypes with heterologous chromosomes, the signal intensities of the above-selected probes were plotted, and the correlation coefficients (R2) among three cassava genotypes under a non-treated condition were evaluated (Table 1). The R2 values were 0.959, 0.967, and 0.879 between MTAI16 and MECU72, MTAI16 and MPER417-003, and MECU72 and MPER417-003, respectively. It is worth noting that the R2 value between MECU72 and MPER417-003 was slightly lower than that of other combinations. This might be due to the following reasons: (i) the MTAI16 ESTs have been used for the microarray design, but the ESTs from MECU72 and MPER417-003 have not been used and (ii) the chromosomes of MECU72 and MPER417-003 might be more heterologous compared with MTAI16. To examine the reproducibility of the experiments, we calculated the coefficient of variation (CV) value for the signal intensities in the three replicative microarray experiments. In this study, we used four types of classification based on the CV value, that is, <0.25, between 0.25 and 0.50, between 0.50 and 0.75, and =0.75. More than 90% of all signals have CV values of <0.50 in both the control and drought-treated conditions (Fig. 3). These results indicate that there are few significant differences in the signal intensities among the three genotypes and that our oligomicroarray can be applied to multiple cassava genotypes.

Black and white bars indicate non-treated and drought-treated samples, respectively. CVs were calculated for signal intensities in the three independent hybridizations.Genes whose expression levels changed >2-fold in response to drought treatment were selected using statistical methods (see Section 2). The following three criteria were used for the gene selection: (i) the signal intensity changed >2-fold between the non-treated and drought-treated samples; (ii) The P value from the t-test for two groups (non-treated and drought-treated samples) was <0.01 and (iii) FDR (q-value) according to the method of Benjamini and Hochberg was <0.1.28 The number of drought stress up-regulated genes was 1078, 305, and 671 in MTAI16, MECU72, and MPER417-003, respectively (Fig. 4) and the number of drought stress down-regulated genes was 597, 419, and 238 in MTAI16, MECU72, and MPER417-003, respectively (Fig. 4). These results suggest that MTAI16 has the specific system for adaptability under various stress conditions, such as drought stress. Previous studies reported that MTAI16 recovered quickly from stress and also had high starch content under drought recovery compared with other varieties studied.19 Sequencing analysis of the full-length cDNA clones from MTAI16 subjected to various stress treatments, such as drought, identified many putative gene duplications that might have played a role in cassava stress responses.8 A total of 168 genes (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table S3) and 69 genes (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table S4) were up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, by drought stress in all three genotypes. Venn diagram analysis of the genes up-regulated (A) or down-regulated (B) by drought stress treatment in the three cassava genotypes. In each genotype, the drought stress-up-regulated genes were identified as follows: (i) ratio (drought treatment/no treatment) =2, (2) t-test, P-value < 0.01, and (3) FDR (q-value) <0.1 according to the method of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995). The drought stress-down-regulated genes were identified as follows: (i) ratio (drought treatment/no treatment) =0.5, (ii) t-test, P-value < 0.01, and (iii) FDR (q-value) <0.1 according to the method of Benjamini and Hochberg (1995).Venn diagram analysis of the genes up-regulated (A) or down-regulated (B) by drought stress treatment in the three cassava genotypes.

Cassava has similar mechanisms for drought stress response and tolerance as other plants, such as arabidopsisDrought can be a major environmental constraint affecting the growth and physiology of many plant species. As a result, many plants have developed strategies to defend against damage caused by drought stress. In this study, we identified 168 genes that were up-regulated by drought stress in three cassava genotypes. Among them, there were many homologs of drought-inducible genes that were identified in previous studies of other plant species, such as Arabidopsis and rice (Supplementary Table S3).30–32Functional category classification using the GO of the Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR10; http://www.arabidopsis.org/tools/bulk/go/index.jsp) for three components (‘biological process’, ‘molecular function’ and ‘cellular component’) was performed on the 168 drought stress up-regulated or 69 down-regulated genes (Fig. 5). Many drought stress up-regulated genes were classified into the GO terms ‘other cellular processes’, ‘other metabolic processes’, ‘unknown biological processes’, ‘response to abiotic or biotic stimulus’ and ‘response to stress’ for biological process. Percentage of GO terms for (A) biological process, (B) molecular function, and (C) cellular component of the genes up-regulated (168 genes in Supplementary Table S3; black bar) and down-regulated (69 genes in Supplementary Table S4; white bar) by drought stress treatment in the 3 genotypes (MTAI16, MECU72, and MPER417-003).Percentage of GO terms for (A) biological process, (B) molecular function, and (C) cellular component of the genes up-regulated (168 genes in Supplementary Table S3; black bar) and down-regulated (69 genes in Supplementary Table S4; white bar) by drought stress treatment in the 3 genotypes (MTAI16, MECU72, and MPER417-003).The drought stress up-regulated genes classified in a GO term ‘response to stress’ (Supplementary Table S5) include the homolog of a key gene in the biosynthetic pathway for abscisic acid (ABA), AtNCED3 (AT3G14440),33 which encodes a member of the 9-cis-epoxycarotenoid dioxygenases; an NAC transcription factor homolog, RD26 (AT4G27410)34 that is involved in the ABA-dependent drought stress signaling pathway; and a homolog of a drought-inducible galactinol synthase, AtGolS1 (AT2G47180),35 which encodes the key step in the biosynthesis of raffinose family oligosaccharides, osmolytes that play a role in drought stress tolerance. Among the drought-inducible genes identified, we also found homologs of several jasmonate ZIM-domain (JAZ) proteins36 that function in jasmonate pathway responses, such as wounding. This is most likely the result of cross-talk between ABA and JA signaling that has been observed in previous studies.37 In cassava, the interaction between ABA and JA might function in protecting the plants from the water loss that occurs under drought stress conditions. This might also be due to the fact that the cassava plants used for this microarray analysis were subjected to a wounding stress when the plantlets were removed from the gelrite medium during the drought stress treatment and when the shoots were cut from the plantlets prior to storage at -80°C.Many drought stress down-regulated genes were classified into the GO terms ‘other intracellular components’, ‘other cytoplasmic components’, ‘chloroplast’, ‘other membranes’ and ‘plastid’ for cellular component (Fig. 5C). The drought stress down-regulated genes classified into the GO terms ‘chloroplast’ or ‘plastid’ include the homologs of a light-harvesting chlorophyll a/b-binding protein, LHCA4 (AT3G47470) and a chloroplast triose phosphate/3-phosphoglycerate translocator, APE2 (AT5G46110) genes (Supplementary Table S4). These results are consistent with previous reports that drought stress inhibits photosynthesis.38 Repression of photosynthesis under drought stress also occurs in cassava in the same way as other plants and might help the plants to survive under the stress.Hierarchical clustering analysis of the 168 drought stress up-regulated and 69 down-regulated genes revealed similar expression pattern of the genes in both non-treated and drought stress-treated conditions among the three genotypes (Fig. 6). The venn diagram analysis also identified many genes up-regulated or down-regulated specifically in each genotype by drought stress treatment (Fig. 4; Supplementary Tables S6–S17). These genes include genes with unknown function and ones with various functional categories, such as transcription factors, protein kinases, stress response-related ones and metabolism-related ones. The GO term analyses for biological process showed that many genes up-regulated specifically in each genotype by drought stress were classified into the GO terms ‘other cellular processes’ and ‘other metabolic processes’. We could not find big differences on the pattern of GO term among the differentially regulated gene groups in each genotype (Supplementary Figs S1–S3). Hierarchical clustering analysis of the genes up-regulated (168 genes) and down-regulated (69 genes) by drought stress treatment in the three cassava genotypes. The signal intensity values for each sample were transformed to log2 values and subjected to hierarchical clustering using standard correlation. The genes with higher and lower signal intensity values are shown in red and blue, respectively. The genes with the signal intensity value of a median level are shown in yellow.Hierarchical clustering analysis of the genes up-regulated (168 genes) and down-regulated (69 genes) by drought stress treatment in the three cassava genotypes.

The genes with higher and lower signal intensity values are shown in red and blue, respectively. The genes with the signal intensity value of a median level are shown in yellow.Many differentially expressed genes under the same conditions (no treatment and drought stress treatment) were identified between the genotypes (Supplementary Tables S18–S30) and the GO term analyses of the genes were performed (Supplementary Figs S4–S6). The number of the differentially expressed genes was larger in MPER417-003/MECU72 compared with that in MTAI16/MECU72 and MTAI16/MPER417-003. The differentially expressed genes between the genotypes include the genes with unknown function and the genes with various functional categories, such as transcription factors, protein kinases, transporters and metabolism-related ones.3.4. Validation of the microarray data by qPCRTo evaluate the expression profiles obtained by microarray analysis, we also performed qPCR analysis. Nine genes were randomly selected from the genes shown in Supplementary Tables S1 and S3. The cassava homolog of the ubiquitin UBC4 gene (Supplementary Table S2) was used as a control because its expression level was constant between no treatment and the 1-h drought treatment. The results of the qPCR analysis were consistent with those of the microarray analysis (Fig. 7). The R2 between the two experiments for the 27 total plots was 0.904.

IntroductionThe human leukocyte antigen (HLA) system encodes highly polymorphic molecules which are fundamental for the triggering of the immune response. Moreover, it is known that the expression of certain HLA molecules is associated with the susceptibility to many autoimmune diseases, including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM).1,2Distinguishing the subjects with susceptibility genes, before the onset of the disease, calls for the development of rapid high-throughput HLA typing technologies. On the one hand, such an ambitious aim seems to contrast with the increasing number of susceptibility conferring alleles that are being discovered in patients affected by specific pathologies.3 On the other hand, it is encouraging that a massively parallel sequencing technology has recently allowed mutation detection in picolitres of cancer specimens.4 For large-scale HLA analysis, we decided to set a method allowing the typing of non-PCR amplified genomic DNA, purified from leukocytes, and non-purified DNA present in cell lysates.We adopted a DNA probe, which is depicted in Fig. 1, matching the sequence of one of the most common alleles conferring susceptibility to IDDM in the Caucasian population and, by making a novel use of Förster resonant energy transfer (FRET), we found a method for detecting sequence variations of even a single nucleotide in DNA template used as target (see Fig. 2). Markers of susceptibility to IDDM have been recognized in the HLA-II region and, in particular, in HLA-II DQA1 and DQB1 loci, coding for the a and ß chains of DQ heterodimer, respectively.5 Extensive molecular studies of HLA-DQ genotype in patients with IDDM led to correlate the susceptibility with the polymorphism of a single amino acid in both DQa and DQß chains.6,7 In particular, the combined presence of an arginine residue in position 52 of the DQa chain and of a neutral residue (serine, alanine or valine) in position 57 of the DQß chain is strongly associated with diabetes onset. On the contrary, the presence of aspartic acid at position 57 of DQß confers resistance to IDDM.2FRET probe matching the DQB1-0201 sequence between codons 51 and 58 (22 bases) and carrying the TAMRA donor and the BHQ2 quencher, whose structures are shown in the bottom.FRET probe matching the DQB1-0201 sequence between codons 51 and 58 (22 bases) and carrying the TAMRA donor and the BHQ2 quencher, whose structures are shown in the bottom.Sequences (antisense) of the region comprising codons 51–60 of the eight relevant DQB1 allelic variants (listed on the left).

Nucleotide changes with respect to DQB1-0201 are marked. The regions shaded in grey are those not covered by the oligonucleotide used as a probe (see Fig. 1).In the present work we focussed on the typing of the DQB1 locus by hybridizing target DNAs to a single probe corresponding to DQB1-0201 ‘susceptible’ allele, which was dual labelled by a fluorescent reporter in 5' and a non-fluorescing quencher in 3'. In such a probe, the fluorescence of the donor tetramethylrhodamine (TAMRA) is quenched via FRET by the black-hole quencher (BHQ2) depending on the conformational differences among the hybrids due to the probe/target mismatches. It is worth noting that fluorescence quenching by FRET is basic to many genotyping methods that include a step in which allele-specific hybridization products must be recognized. These methods rely on the fact that FRET removes the excitation energy deposited on the donor (D) towards the acceptor (A) with an efficiency that depends on the D-to-A distance. As a result, when D and A are in close proximity, the D fluorescence is weaker than that emitted when they are at greater distances from each other. Multiple allele-specific probes, each labelled with a different D–A pair, can be used for querying allelic sequences.8 The sequence of each probe is complementary to a specific polymorphic sequence and probes are mixed all at once with the PCR-amplified template. The highly stringent hybridization conditions allow annealing only of the perfectly matching probe, which results in a greater D-to-A distance, thus in an enhanced fluorescence emission of D. Conversely, as the non-matching probes preserve the native coiled conformation, their fluorescence is quenched. The genotype of the template DNA is inferred by assessing which D is the fluorescing one. We exploit the fact that FRET can produce quantitatively different fluorescence responses depending on the probe–target hybrid conformation, thus making it feasible SNP genotyping by means of a single probe. Pioneering attempts in this direction have been made by Gaylord et al.9 and, later, by Al Attar et al.10. The latter group used a cationic polymer conjugated to the targets as D and monitored the fluorescence intensity of A attached to a single peptide nucleic acid probe. As the neutral peptide backbone of the probe did not bind to D, the acceptor A received the excitation energy only upon hybridization of the probe to the targets. By applying this scheme to typing of ABL polymorphism in the BCR-ABL oncogene, Al Attar et al. have determined significantly different values of the FRET efficiency between D and A when the probe was hybridized to each of the possible target sequences (i.e. to each of the possible mutated alleles). Thus, they demonstrated the feasibility of ABL typing by using a single probe. It is easy to realize that distinguishing among the hybrids that our probe forms with the different allelic sequences by absolute measurements of D-fluorescence intensity is a hopeless approach to the development of a typing method suitable for non-purified/non-amplified genomic DNA. Indeed, a high-throughput screening method based on FRET should work with cellular lysates, where the DNA concentration is variable from sample to sample, and utilize detectors whose response is stable against environmental stray light conditions. In our approach we quantify the FRET efficiencies of each probe/template hybrid by analysing the D fluorescence temporal decay on a very fast time scale. We measure the TAMRA-fluorescence decay time (tD) upon picosecond laser excitation, at a wavelength that is only absorbed by this chromophore, and detect the fluorescence by a time-correlated single-photon counting (TCSPC) apparatus, which is endowed with a temporal resolution of <30 ps. Though the acquisition rate is less than one photon per excitation pulse, which ensures the applicability of our technique to the detection of even few probe–target duplexes, good determinations of the tD values are done in few minutes due to the megahertz repetition rate of the excitation laser. The slight differences in the distance of the BHQ2 acceptor from the TAMRA donor and the consequent differences in FRET efficiencies produce distinct tD values for the probe hybridized to each of the allelic sequences.2. Materials and methods2.1. Hybridization of oligonucleotidesThe D–A pair in the single-stranded dual-labelled oligonucleotide probe in Fig. 1, D-5'(ACGCTGCTGGGGCTGCCTGCCG)3'-A, was the TAMRA analogue 5'-Dimethoxytrityloxy-5-[N-((tetramethylrhodaminyl)-aminohexyl)-3-acrylimido]-2'-deoxyUridine-3'-[(2-cyanoethyl)-(N,N-diisopropyl)]-phosphoramidite (TAMRA) and the black hole quencher 4'-(4-Nitro-phenyldiazo)-2'-methoxy-5'-methoxy-azobenzene-4""-(N-ethyl)-N-ethyl-2-cyanoethyl-(N,N-diisopropyl)-phosphoramidite (BHQ2). The dual-labelled probe, purified by high performance liquid chromatography, was purchased from Eurofins MWG Operon (Ebersberg, Germany). The other oligonucleotides (see Fig. 2) were purchased from TIB Molbiol (Genova, Italy). Twenty nanomoles of each lyophilized samples were resuspended with Tris–HCl/EDTA buffer (pH 7.6; 10 mM ionic strength). The probe and the target oligonucleotides were diluted to the same final concentration (500 nM) and mixed in equal volumes. The mixtures were gradually heated at a rate of +3°C/min to 98°C and kept at this temperature for 10 min to allow for the denaturation of secondary structures of the single strands and to destroy the dimers that could be present. Each probe–target solution was then cooled down, at a rate of -1°C/min, to a temperature that was lower by 1°C than the melting temperature of the duplex: 73°C for the DQB1-0201 oligonucleotide, 67°C for 0302, 64°C for 0301, 61°C for 05031 and 0402, 58°C for 0501, 0502 and 0602. The samples were kept at these plateau temperatures for 20 min, in order to maximize annealing. Finally, the hybridized solutions were slowly brought to room temperature (-2°C/min) to be analysed with the TCSPC apparatus. The whole procedure of temperature-controlled annealing was carried out in the thermostat of a ThermoQuest-Finnigan gas chromatograph (San Jose, CA, USA).2.2. Hybridization of genomic DNAGenomic DNA was extracted by standard procedures from five HLA homozygous lymphoblastoid cell lines, namely PITOUT(DQB1-0201), HOM-2 (DQB1-0501), JVM (DQB1-0301), SAVC (DQB1-0302), and OLL (DQB1-0402)6 and from the heterozygous cell line RAJI (DQB1 0201-0501; G. Tosi, personal communication). The quality of DNA was verified by running the samples on agarose gel. Although DNA were purified about 20 yrs ago and stored at 4°C, they were not grossly degraded (data not shown). The DNA concentrations were in the range of 100–600 µg/ml, depending on the cell line. The probe was added at ˜1 pM final concentration. The procedure of temperature-controlled annealing performed after DNA denaturation at 98°C was similar to that adopted for oligonucleotides, except for the fact that the samples were put together in the thermostat and exposed to a sequence of five 20-min periods, in which the plateau temperatures were set, in order, at the values of 73, 67, 64, 61, and 58°C. These multiple exposures to decreasing temperature values should allow optimal annealing of the probe to the DQB1 antisense alleles in the following order: 0201 first, then 0302, 0301, 0402, and 0501 at last. In the same way we treated 50:50 mixtures of SAVC DNA (0302) with either PITOUT (0201) or OLL (0402) at equal concentrations (100 µg/ml) and added, as above, with the probe.Cell lysates were prepared from PITOUT and RAJI cells. Briefly, 106 cells were resuspended with 125 µl of solution A (10 mM Tris–HCl pH 8.3, 100 mM KCl) plus 110 µl of solution B (10 mM TRIS–HCl pH 8.3, 1% Tween 20, 1% Nonidet P40) added with 15 µl Proteinase K (10 mg/ml). The cellular suspensions were incubated at 56°C for 1 h and at 95°C for 15 min. An aliquot of the cell lysate was incubated with RNAse A (1 mg/ml) for 2 min at room temperature and then at 95°C for 10 min. Both untreated and RNAse-treated cell lysates were added with equal volumes of probe (1 pM final concentration). Denaturation and annealing were performed as described for purified DNA samples.2.3. Measurements of D-fluorescence decay timeAll TCSPC measurements were performed at room temperature. In the case of oligonucleotides the fluorescence was detected at 90° with respect to laser excitation and the sample was contained in 1 × 1 cm quartz cuvette with four polished windows. Owing to the smallness of the available sample volumes, in the cases of both DNAs and lysates we adopted an epi-fluorescence 20× microscope geometry, in which ~50 µl of the samples contained in 200 µl microwells were excited and the fluorescence collected along the same direction. The D-fluorescence was separated from the reflected/back-scattered excitation by a dichroic mirror at 45° (DMLP567, Thorlabs GmbH, Dachau, Germany). The excitation/detection apparatus, extensively described in a previous work of ours,11 is entirely made up of commercial components. Its main features are excitation pulses at 532 nm (6.4 ps duration at 113 MHz repetition rate), typically attenuated by a factor of >103 to achieve single-photon regime in the fluorescence detection; single-photon avalanche diode with built-in active quenching circuitry and thermoelectric cooling as the detector; fluorescence decay patterns recorded with 2.44 ps/channel resolution; full-width at a half-maximum duration of the detected excitation pulse of <30 ps; time-to-amplitude conversion operated in reversed start–stop modality so that each detected photon produced a valid start signal; fluorescence detected >550 nm; each decay pattern acquired up to a fixed number of counts at the peak, namely 65535; each acquisition time recorded; each measurement repeated three times at least. The zero of the time scale was set at the peak channel for all decay patterns.In addition to the measurements on the hybrids, we also measured the fluorescence decay of a solution of the pure single-stranded probe at the same concentration as in the hybridized samples. Preliminarily to data analysis, the raw decay patterns acquired for both this solution and those containing the hybridized oligonucleotides were normalized to the acquisition time and to the absorbance values at 556 nm (TAMRA peak). The experimental decay data were treated as described below.All decay patterns exhibit fast initial transients of negligible amplitudes, thus showing that dual-labelled fluorescent probes left free in solution are virtually absent in our oligonucleotide samples. Such a fast transient represents the majority of the fluorescence decay of the solution of the pure single-stranded probe, in which it is summed to the slow decay component emitted by free TAMRA. Thus, after normalizing to acquisition time and TAMRA absorbance, we subtract this slow component (with the amplitude and lifetime detected for the pure single-stranded probe, see below) from all decays and fit the difference starting from 400 to 800 ps after the peak. For all hybridized oligonucleotide samples we find very good fittings by using single exponentials whose time constants we interpret as the tD values (see column (a) in Table 1). As an example we show the case of the oligonucleotide mimicking the DQB1-0201 in Fig. 3.

We subtract this component from the rough experimental decays of all the hybridized DNA samples with the initial amplitude and lifetime that we detected in the decay pattern measured on the solution of pure probe. The resulting patterns are normalized to their integrals. In the case of cell lysates we detect a further slow-decay component (~5 ns) that is typical of flavine mononucleotide, which is the main endogenous fluorofore absorbing light at 532 nm. We subtract this component from the experimental decays measured for the lysates before proceeding as above.

Identification of the hybrids formed by allele-specific HLA-II DQB1 oligonucleotides and the 0201 oligoprobeIn order to establish our FRET-based HLA-II DQB1 typing method we first set the system by using the panel of synthetic oligonucleotides listed in Fig. 2. These oligonucleotides are complementary to the coding sequences of the eight relevant DQB1 alleles and encompass codons of 51–60.6 Nucleotide variations with respect to the 0201 allele, shown on the top, are underlined. Each oligonucleotide was hybridized with the probe corresponding to the 0201 variant having the GCC codon for alanine in position 57. The oligoprobe and the structures of the TAMRA donor and BHQ2 acceptor molecules are shown in Fig. 1. In general, to increase the specificity of a probe for its target DNA, it is desirable to design the oligonucleotide with a great rather than a small number of nucleotides. However, this is not true for probes dual labelled at the 5'- and 3'-positions by a D and an A interacting by FRET, in that the D-to-A distance cannot remarkably overcome the Förster radius. We designed a probe of 22 nucleotides covering from codon 51 up to the first base of codon 58 as we preliminarily demonstrated that probe/target mismatches next to the probe ends, where D or A are covalently bound, cause the greatest changes in the FRET efficiency.11,12 In the present case, mismatches at the polymorphic codon 57, which occur in the cases of all variants except 0201 and 0302, are expected to prevent pairing of the last three–four bases on the side of the BHQ2. Such an ‘unzipping’ of the duplex structure should let A approach D and cause a sizeable decrease in the donor-fluorescence decay time (tD). It is worth noting that the eight DQB1 alleles are all identical from codon 58 to codon 60, thus further extending the probe would prevent unzipping.As mentioned in Section 2.3.1 the decay patterns recorded in the case of oligonucleotides exhibit fast initial transients of negligible amplitudes, thus showing that dual-labelled fluorescent probes left free in solution are virtually absent in our oligonucleotide samples and testifying that the affinity of our new 22-nucleotide probe for the DQB1 template is notably enhanced with respect to that of the 18-nucleotide probe, with which we detected sizeable amounts of non-hybridized probe molecules.11 The tD values that we determined for the DQB1-0201 probe binding to each of the eight synthetic oligonucleotides are listed in column (a) of Table 1. For all hybrids, except those that the probe forms with the variant sequences 05031 and 0602, we find significantly different tD values. Most importantly, the greatest value corresponds to the perfect matching of the probe with the complementary 0201 oligonucleotide. The next highest tD value is exhibited by the probe binding the 0302 sequence, which is the only one displaying a base composition identical to that of the 0201 allele at codon 57. The manner in which the other values of tD scale agrees with what we previously observed by using a probe containing 18 instead of 22 nucleotides.11 Moreover, the differences among the data in column (a) confirm that the type of mismatch remarkably influences the decay time. In fact, the 0501 and 0602 alleles, having only one nucleotide variation in the same position of codon 57 (CAA and CTA, respectively) display significantly different tD values upon hybridization to the 0201 probe.3.2. HLA-II DQB1 typing of purified, non-amplified genomic DNAIn order to validate our FRET-based HLA-II DQB1 typing approach set with synthetic oligonucleotides, we tested the system with non-PCR-amplified genomic DNAs extracted from five HLA-homozygous lymphoblastoid cell lines with different DQB1 specificities.6 Upon the modifications of the setup as to the excitation/collection optics described in Sub-section 2.3, the corresponding tD values were measured (see data listed in column (b) of Table 1). These values are surprisingly equal, within the experimental errors, to those obtained with the oligonucleotides corresponding to the same DQB1 alleles, which are listed on the same lines in column (a), in spite of the fact that these measurements were performed on entire genomic DNA.To assess the possibility of recognizing the presence of the 0201 variant also in the case of a heterozygous genomic DNA, we measured the fluorescence decays for the two 50:50 mixtures of 0201 with 0302 and of 0302 with 0402. Such samples were chosen in that the tD values obtained from the fittings of D201,EX and D302,EX are the most similar (see column (b) in Table 1). A predominant decay component with time constant equal to the tD of D201,EX was found in the fitting of curve D201-302,EX (former sample) only. In the fitting of D302-402,EX the predominant component had time constant equal to the tD of D302,EX.We conclude that the probe–template annealing is correctly attained in both homozygous and heterozygous situations.3.3. Identification of DQB1-0201 allele in cell lysatesIn order to verify whether our typing method is sensitive enough to detect the DQB1-0201 allele directly in cell lysates without prior DNA purification, we performed measurements on both untreated and RNAse-treated cell lysates obtained from PITOUT (homozygous DQB1-0201) and RAJI (heterozygous DQB1 0201-0501) cell lines. DQB1-0201 probe was designed on the basis of the sequence of the ‘plus’ strand of DNA to avoid annealing with RNA. However, to completely exclude any possible spurious and non-specific annealing/interference derived from RNA in a ‘dirty’ system such as that of the cell extracts, we treated the cell lysates with RNAse. For both cell lines, the fluorescence responses were not improved in RNAse-treated as compared with untreated lysates (data not shown), suggesting that RNAse treatment is not a prerequisite step. Moreover, the fitting of D201,LY returned a value tD = 2724 ± 4 ps, which coincides with that returned by the fitting of D201,EX in the first line of Table 1, column (b) within the experimental errors. We add that the tD component is so much more relevant in D201,LY than in D201,EX as to make the t' component negligible in amplitude.In the case of the RJ 2.2.5 lysate we also measured the decay for its extracted DNA and obtained a D201-501,EX curve in which the predominant component had time constant equal to the tD of D201,EX. This was also the major component in D201-501,LY.4. DiscussionIn this study we successfully developed a new method to identify the DQB1-0201 variant, an allele that is considered a genetic marker of susceptibility to IDDM. Indeed, this allele is significantly over-represented in patients with IDDM. The method is based on the measurements of fluorescence decay times performed with single photon sensitivity and picosecond resolution. Non-amplified genomic DNAs, purified from lymphoblastoid cell lines and bearing different sequences in the polymorphic region of the HLA-DQB1 gene, were hybridized with a single DNA probe corresponding to the DQB1-0201 allele. The same probe was also hybridized to non-purified DNA contained in crude cell extracts. The probe was dual-labelled with fluorescence donor-and-acceptor chromophores at its opposite ends. The chromophores undergo FRET, whose efficiency is characterized by measuring the fluorescence decay time tD of the donor. As the FRET efficiency, and hence the tD value, is differently modified by the number of probe-to-target mismatches and by their positions, the hybrids formed by the probe with each allelic variant are identified by distinct values of tD. It is worth noting that the picosecond-laser excitation wavelength we adopted, 532 nm, is very close to the absorption peak of the TAMRA donor, which falls at 556 nm, being not even absorbed by the non-fluorescent BHQ2 acceptor.We achieved our main goal by successive steps. We first showed that the hybrids formed by allele-specific HLA-II DQB1 oligonucleotides and the 0201 oligoprobe can be identified through the different tD values. Though in a previous work of ours we obtained such a result by using an 18-nucleotides probe,11 reproducing it with our 22-nucleotides probe, which we deemed ideal for typing of genomic DNA templates, was not obvious in that this probe covered codon 51, which is identical in all allelic variants (see Figs 1 and 2). So much so that, as shown in Table 1, for the mismatching oligonucleotides mimicking the sequences of the DQB1 allelic variants other than 0201, we measure tD values that are both greater than those for the 18-nucleotide probe (see, in particular, the cases of alleles 0501, 0502, 05031, and 0602, which produced very fast decays when hybridized to the 18-nucleotide probe) and much more similar to that measured for the perfectly matching target oligonucleotide.11 For these target sequences we had hypothesized an unzipping involving the first five nucleotides, due to the double mismatch of the second and fifth nucleotides. However, the addition of the three nucleotides corresponding to codon 51 confers a greatly enhanced selectivity to the 22-nucleotide probe, as reported in Section 3.1, and does not prevent discrimination of the DQB1-0201 genotype. Beside the above considerations, the scaling of the values in column (a) of Table 1 agrees with the explanations that we presented in the quoted work of the dependence of the tD changes on both the number and the position of the base mismatches. Moreover, the 22-nucleotide probe preserves the tD sensitivity to the variation of a single nucleotide, as shown by the results reported in Section 3.1 for the 0501 and 0602 alleles.On the one hand, the tD measurements on entire genomic DNA represent a very strong test of the probe selectivity. On the other hand, as they lead for each allelic species to the same tD values that are found for the corresponding oligonucleotide, these tD measurements constitute the core result of our work. The coincidence between the values in the two columns in Table 1 and, in the case of DQB1-0201, with the tD value obtained with cell lysate, demonstrates that the conformation of the probe–template duplex is identical in the three instances. This is not surprising once the probe–template annealing is correctly attained, which actually is the main assumption underlying the rationale of the method. In fact, on the local scale of 22 base pairs, the tertiary structure of genomic DNA is not relevant, as the persistence length of a DNA B-structured double-helix is estimated to be ~50 base pairs. In our opinion the really astonishing feature is the notable template specificity of the probe that leads to the observation of a detectable tD component in the decays obtained with genomic DNA (even when non-purified), which prevails in all cases. We can only attribute this result to the goodness of both the design of the probe and the scaling of temperatures during annealing. Moreover, designing the DQB1-0201 probe on the basis of the sequence of the ‘plus’ strand of DNA prevents annealing with RNA, thus making RNAse treatment of the cell extracts not necessary.We think that a very important role is played in this work by the strategies we devised to determine the values of tD. First they are suitable for taking into account that not all the TAMRA molecules that contribute to the detected fluorescence-decay patterns decay with time-constant tD. There can be dual-labelled fluorescent probes free in solution, thus keeping their natural conformation as single-stranded probe and contributing decay-components shorter than tD. There might also be probes lacking the BHQ2 acceptor as well as TAMRA molecules not bound to the probe: both of them decay slower than any TAMRA quenched via FRET by the presence of a more-or-less distant BHQ2. Moreover, in the case of lysates, flavine mononucleotide fluorescence adds to the TAMRA decay. The overall effect is that the experimental decay patterns deviate from single exponentials. Finally, the binding of the probe to the specific target sequences is contrasted by partial annealing to other genomic DNA regions other than the allelic-variant under examination. However, a neutral application to all experimental decay patterns of the strategy described in Section 2 and already used in a previous work of ours,11 brought to decays (Dx) of remarkable amplitudes that could be fitted by the sum of two exponentials in the case of homozygous genotypes. The faster one has a decay time t' = 709 ± 67 ps, which is attributable to the partially annealed probes, while the slower one decays with the tD values reported in Table 1. For heterozygous genotypes, beside t', we recognized the decay of the allele best matching the probe as the predominant one. The further decay component was too low in amplitude to allow identification of the second allele, which might be defined by using a second allele-specific probe. Nonetheless, we attained our primary goal, that is, the identification of the DQB1-0201 allele in a heterozygous genotype even in the presence of the allele with the most similar tD (i.e. DQB1-0302). The result obtained for the allele mixture of DQB1-0302 with DQB1-0402 showed that the method is free from the risk of detecting false positives (i.e. erroneously inferring the presence of the 0201 allele) even when the 0302 allele is present. Finally, it is worth noting that, when DQB1-0201 was present, we could distinguish between homozygous and heterozygous genotypes.The fact that superimposable results were obtained with crude cell extracts without the need of DNA purification, makes our HLA typing method greatly advantageous with respect to other current techniques. As to the performance in a clinical setting, we think it is worth noting that, once the cell lysates are prepared, our technique only requires common buffers and negligible amounts of dual-labelled probes, with no need of enzymatic reactions or temperature-controlled incubation steps. Firstly, this makes the analysis easier and reduces the risks of sample contamination/degradation. Moreover, by virtue of the reduced amount of consumables needed, our method combines the timelines of the most state-of-art genotyping techniques based on PCR amplification with superior cost-effectiveness, which is a desirable feature in view of an application to population screening. Finally, the HLA typing method reported here is relatively simple; the instrumentation that is needed is not particularly expensive and is prone to be adapted for routine use in a diagnostic laboratory.The single-photon sensitivity, which is intrinsic to all TCSPC techniques, also deserves some comment, in that it can bring the low detection limit of genomic DNA down to unprecedented values. In fact, as specified in Section 2.2, to keep the detected-photon rate within the single-photon regime, we attenuated the excitation laser by a factor of >103 and obtained good fluorescence decay patterns from DNA samples of few hundredths picomolar concentration. However, there is no reason why, by using the full power of the laser, we could not lower the DNA concentrations by a factor of one thousand and obtain the same results without increasing the data-acquisition times. We think that, such a performance would be extremely desirable in a clinical setting for applications in which the sensitivity issue is definitely a matter of concern. Discriminating among the different alleles by the tD values, as shown in this paper in the case of a highly polymorphic gene, may allow the use of this method not only for routine typing of HLA, but also for the identification of specific ‘pathologic’ sequences, for example mutations of genes causing inherited genetic diseases or mutated oncogenes, in order to identify the specific mutation in tumour tissues and, most importantly, the extent of mutated genes in pre-neoplastic lesions.FundingThis work was supported by the following grants to R.S.A.: Fondazione Cariplo 2008-2230 ‘Cellular and molecular basis of human retroviral-dependent pathology’; A.I.R.C IG 8862 ‘New strategies of tumor vaccination and immunotherapy based on optimized triggering of anti-tumor CD4+ T cells'; MIUR-PRIN project 2008-WXF7KK ‘New strategies of immunointervention against tumors’.

IntroductionDiscovery of the DNA sequence polymorphism is a prerequisite to generating genetic markers for various applications of modern genomics research such as map-based cloning, marker-assisted breeding, association mapping and understanding genome structure and function. Among the sequence polymorphisms, single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) represent the most abundant type of variation present in DNA. SNPs are mostly biallelic,1 co-dominantly inherited, sequence tagged and occur at high density within genomes.2 They are thus amenable to the development of genetic molecular markers at low cost, which can provide sufficiently dense genome coverage for the dissection of complex traits. SNPs are known to occur at high frequencies of ~1 per 500–1000 bp in humans3,4 and in plant genomes also, where their frequency appears to vary significantly, e.g. 1 SNP per 16 bp in eucalyptus,5 1 per 107 bp in radish,6 1 per 147 bp in rice,7 1 per 200 bp in maize,8 1 per 370 bp in soybean genes9 and 1 per 500 bp in Arabidopsis.10Recently, technological advancements have accelerated the genome-wide SNP discovery not only in model species, but also in crop plants. Initial efforts relied on the discovery of large numbers of SNPs from EST databases such as in grapevine,11 spruce,12 cowpea,13 pea,14 wheat15 and pine.16 However, more recently, with the development of the next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms which enable the sequencing of millions of bases at deep coverage, thousands of SNPs have been identified in many species such as maize,17 soybean,18Medicago,19Eucalyptus,20 rice21 and sunflower.22 To utilize the millions of available SNPs, various high-throughput SNP genotyping platforms were simultaneously developed such as the GoldenGate Genotyping Technology (GGGT; Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA),23 BeadChip-based Infinium assay (Illumina),24,25 SNPStream (Beckman Coulter, USA),26 GeneChip (Affymetrix, USA)27,28 and competitive allele-specific PCR, KASPar (KBio science, UK)29 that allow large-scale genotyping of SNPs in parallel in a large set of individuals.30 These approaches vary in terms of sensitivity, reproducibility, accuracy, capability of multiplexing and throughput. Among them, one of the most versatile SNP genotyping platforms is the Illumina GGGT, which is capable of multiplexing from 96 to 1536 SNPs per assay in a single reaction over a 3-day period.23 This technology has persistently been reported as highly reliable, with high SNP conversion rates and has fostered genetic research in several major as well as in orphan plants, especially self-pollinating crops that have been plagued by a narrow genetic base with nucleotide diversities from 0.2 to 0.5%,13,31–33 as well as the cross-pollinated species with higher sequence diversities of =2%.12,34,35 High-throughput SNP genotyping has enabled various applications in plant genomics especially genome-wide association studies and linkage disequilibrium studies,10,36–38 synteny-based comparative genomics13,39 and high-resolution genetic mapping.40,41 A high-density genetic linkage map is one of the most important genomic tools to accelerate marker-assisted breeding. Recent studies have reported the successful utilization of high-throughput GGGT for SNP genotyping to build genetic linkage maps in legumes such as cowpea,13 soybean18,31 and pea,14 and even in plants with highly repetitive or polyploid genomes like barley,32 pine,34 grass41 and maize.42 Production of high-density SNP-based maps have facilitated the fine mapping and cloning of agronomically important genes and also anchoring and orienting the scaffolds generated by whole genome sequence assembly data.18,41,43Chickpea (C. arietinum L.), a diploid (2n = 2x = 16), annual, self-pollinated crop, with a genome size of 740 Mb,44 represents the world's third most important legume crop that is mainly grown in the arid and semi-arid regions of Asia and Africa. It serves as a key source of protein in human nutrition and also plays an important role in the maintenance of soil fertility owing to its ability to fix atmospheric nitrogen. Due to its economic importance, there has been a recent spurt in chickpea genomics research and a large number of genomic resources, such as molecular markers and linkage maps,45–48 ESTs49–52 and NGS-based transcriptomes,53–55 have become available. Currently, there are ~2000 co-dominant molecular markers available, which include ~980 genomic simple sequence repeats (gSSRs),45,46,56–62 and EST-derived markers including 361 EST-SSRs, 238 Intron-Targeted Primers (ITPs), 109 Expressed Sequence Tag Polymorphisms (ESTPs) and 294 Cleaved Amplified Polymorphic Sites/SNPs.45,47–49,51,63 Using these co-dominant markers, linkage maps that have been generated define ~500 mapped positions.45–48,58,64 Moreover, from the recent chickpea transcriptome sequencing, even though ~5000 molecular markers have been reported,54,55 the validation and genotyping of these molecular markers is yet to be undertaken. Despite this increased availability of genomic resources, the large-scale discovery and utilization of SNPs, which serve as the most potential markers for providing sufficiently dense genetic maps, has not been carried out in chickpea. Therefore, in the present study, the large-scale identification of genome-wide SNPs was undertaken from the NGS of two parents of a mapping population (C. arietinum cv. ICC4958 and C. reticulatum PI489777). Conversion of SNPs into successful genotyping assays based on the Illumina GoldenGate technology was demonstrated for the first time in chickpea. Moreover, the SNP markers were successfully mapped in the backdrop of previously reported co-dominant markers to generate one of the most comprehensive and dense genetic maps of chickpea.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material and DNA isolationFor SNP discovery, the two genotypes C. arietinum ICC4958 (fusarium wilt resistant and drought tolerant) and C. reticulatum PI489777 (wild annual species, fusarium wilt susceptible), which are parents of a mapping population, were sequenced. Nuclear DNA from these two genotypes was isolated using the protocol of Malmberg et al.65 and used for sequencing. For SNP genotyping and linkage map generation, the internationally accepted reference mapping population consisting of 129 RILs (recombinant inbred lines) arising from an inter-specific cross between the two genotypes mentioned above was utilized. Genomic DNA was isolated from fresh young leaves of the two mapping parents and the 129 RILs using the GenElute™ plant genomic DNA Miniprep kit (Sigma). The DNA quality was checked by electrophoresis on 0.8% agarose gels. For SNP genotyping, the DNA was quantified using Quant-iT™ Pico Green® dsDNA Kit (Invitrogen) and the fluorescence was measured with the Microtiter plate reader (Varioscan from Thermo Scientific). Samples were adjusted to 50 ng/µl using Tris-EDTA buffer. The GoldenGate genotyping assay was performed using 250 ng of DNA from each of the RILs.2.2. NGS and SNP discoverySNP discovery was based on the high-throughput next generation whole genome sequencing of the two genotypes, i.e. C. arietinum cv. ICC4958 and its wild relative C. reticulatum cv. PI489777. Sequencing of C. arietinum ICC4958 was carried out primarily by the 454/Roche GS FLX Titanium platform, for which DNA sample preparation and construction of whole-genome shotgun (WGS) and matepair libraries were performed as described by the manufacturer,66 with some modifications. Briefly, the nuclear DNA was nebulized and size-selected for a 300–900-bp fragment size using Agencourt AMPure SPRI beads and ligated with specific adapters A and B at each end, which resulted in generating a single-stranded or a double-stranded library. One single-stranded library using the standard library preparation kit and two double-stranded libraries using a rapid library preparation kit with an average insert size of 705 bases were used for sequencing. The libraries were amplified by emPCR.66 DNA molecules that contain a single A and B adapters at each end were enriched with capture beads coated with capture DNA. Sequencing was performed using GS FLX Titanium Sequencing kits following the manufacturer's protocol (Roche Applied Sciences, Mannheim, Germany). The generated Roche 454 reads were submitted to the Short Read Archive (SRA) database of NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra) and assigned the accession number SRA053228.1. These reads were assembled using the de novo assembly tool Newbler (GS de novo assembler, Roche Applied Sciences) version 2.3 to obtain the reference sequence. Further, two genomic DNA libraries of 3 kb average insert size, of both the parents (C. arietinum ICC4958 and C. reticulatum PI489777) were also prepared by the SOLiD Opti Mate-paired library kit following the manufacturer's protocol and sequenced using the SOLiD 4.0 platform (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). These reads were assigned the accession number SRA053197.5 by the SRA of NCBI. SNPs were identified by aligning and mapping the SOLiD reads of ICC4958 and PI489777 onto the Roche assembly using the tool HAPS (http://solidsoftwaretools.com/gf/project/haps/). For the selection of SNPs the following criteria were used: (i) non-reference alleles with a minimum throughput of 5X and score 0.6 were selected, (ii) the non-reference alleles with any variant (SNPs or indels) within 60 bases upstream or downstream of the consensus reference sequences were discarded and (iii) one SNP from each contig was chosen to ensure genome-wide distribution.The second approach for SNP discovery was amplicon resequencing. This involved the identification of SNPs from chickpea ESTs generated earlier in the laboratory and is described in Choudhary et al.48 A set of 222 EST-derived primers were used to PCR amplify and resequence genomic DNA of the two parental lines (C. arietinum cv. ICC4958 and C. reticulatum cv. PI489777) of the reference mapping population.2.3. Development of the GoldenGate SNP genotyping assaysSNP genotyping was carried out using the Illumina GGGT. For developing the GGGT assay, the identified SNPs along with the 60 bp sequence flanking it on either side were submitted to Illumina for processing by Illumina's Array Design Tool (ADT) in order to obtain a designability rank score for each SNP ranging from 0 to 1. This score serves as a reliability metric for testing whether or not a particular SNP will convert into a successful working GoldenGate assay where SNPs with the scores of 0.6 or higher possess a high probability of converting into a successful genotyping assay. Thus, SNPs having the highest ADT scores were selected for designing the custom Oligo Pool All (CpOPA) containing the allele-specific and locus-specific oligos for use in the Illumina GoldenGate assay and the first chickpea 768-OPA was generated and designated CpOPA-I. The list of SNPs and their flanking regions that constituted CpOPA-I are presented in Supplementary Table S1. Genotyping of SNPs was performed using Illumina's BeadArray Express Reader according to the standard manufacturer's protocol,23,31 with 250 ng (50 ng/µl) of genomic DNA from each individual RIL of the mapping population. The automatic allele calling for each locus was inferred with the GenomeStudio Software V2011.1 (Illumina). The fluorescence images of array matrix carrying Cy3- and Cy5-labelled beads were generated with the two-channel scanner. A genotype that is homozygous for one SNP allele will display a signal in either the Cy3 or the Cy5 channel, whereas a genotype that is heterozygous will display a signal in both channels. The intensity data were loaded in GenomeStudio, and cluster positions were assigned to all genotypes at each SNP and these were checked manually for errors and rescored while designating homozygous and heterozygous clusters. Further, the call rates and the GenTrain and GenCall score generated using the GenomeStudio software were analysed for SNP reliability. The GenTrain and GenCall50 score of =0.4 and the call rate of =95% were used as the Illumina recommended thresholds for declaring a reliable SNP.2.4. Construction of the genetic linkage mapThe inter-specific reference mapping population consisting of 129 RILs described above was used for genotyping and map generation. For linkage analysis, the GoldenGate genotyping data of the successful SNPs were utilized. In addition to this, the genotyping data of 368 polymorphic markers (52 EST-SSRs, 51 ITPs, 25 ESTPs, 2 MtESTs, 130 gSSRs and 108 STMS; Table 1) recently mapped by Choudhary et al.48 using the same reference mapping population were also combined with the SNP genotyping data for anchoring and integrating the previously mapped co-dominant markers. This complete marker data set was employed for linkage analysis using Joinmap ver. 4.0.67 A <U+03C7>2 test (P < 0.05) was performed for the conformity to the expected Mendelian segregation ratio of 1:1. Markers showing segregation distortion were also integrated into the map. Markers were ordered with the regression mapping algorithm and were classified into LGs using the grouping module at LOD thresholds of 8.0–10.0 at an increment of 0.5. Linkage groups were determined at LOD 9.5 with a recombination frequency smaller than 0.49 and a maximum threshold value of 5 for the jump. The best marker order was determined using the ‘Ripple’ function (value of 1). Recombination frequencies were converted to map distances in centiMorgans (cM) using the Kosambi mapping function.68Markers utilized for construction of the inter-specific linkage map of chickpea (C. arietinum ICC4958 × C. reticulatum PI489777)Markers utilized for construction of the inter-specific linkage map of chickpea (C. arietinum ICC4958 × C. reticulatum PI489777)2.5. SyntenySynteny analysis of chickpea was carried out using genomic (gSSRs and SNPs) and genic markers (EST-SSRs, ITPs and ESTPs) from the current chickpea map. Marker sequences were aligned against the chromosome-based assembly of Medicago HapMap Mt 3.5 database [Medicago truncatula HapMap Project 2010 (http://www.medicagohapmap.org/downloads.php)] as well as with Glycine max, JGI Glyma1 [Soybean Genome Project (http://www.phytozome.net/soybean)] using local Blastn with an E-value of <1e-05. Synteny was visualized using MapChart 2.2 (Voorrips 2002). All the Blastn individual hits corresponding to markers from the chickpea LGs (CaLG1-8) were parsed into the Microsoft Excel and the whole genome dot-blots were developed by using the physical location (Mb) of M. truncatula and G. max sequences and the genetic location (cM) of chickpea sequences.3. Results3.1. SNP identificationSNPs were identified from the whole genome sequencing of the two parents of the chickpea reference mapping population namely C. arietinum ICC4958 and its wild progenitor C. reticulatum PI489777. Nuclear genomes of the parents were sequenced to various depths using the NGS platforms, i.e. the Roche 454 GSFLX Titanium and the Applied Biosystem's SOLiD platforms and compared for SNP identification. WGS libraries (three) of C. arietinum cv. ICC4958 nuclear DNA were used for 15 runs generating a total of 20.50 million filtered reads with 7.674 Gb high-quality (Phred score 20) bases. All the filtered reads generated by the 454 GS FLX platform were assembled by the de novo assembly tool Newbler (GS de novo assembler, Roche Applied Sciences) version 2.3 to obtain the primary assembly. The assembly parameters used were seed step 12, minimum overlap 40, minimum overlap identity 95% and seed length 16, with default quality filter, adapter and primer trimming of the input reads. The assembly yielded a total length of 350 724 940 bases in 160 883 large contigs (=500 bases) of average size 2180 bp and the N50 value of 3541 bp with 98.66% of the bases having quality of Q40 or more. Of these, 1000 largest contigs ranging in size from 36 to 13 kb were chosen as the reference sequence for drawing out the single-nucleotide changes. Further, 3 kb paired end libraries of both the parents (C. arietinum ICC4958 and C. reticulatum PI489777) were sequenced using the SOLiD (Applied Biosystems) platform to generate 28 Gb (37.8X) and 12 Gb (16.2X) high-quality paired short reads (50 bases), respectively. SNPs in C. reticulatum PI489777 were identified using the SOLiD reads. First, the SOLiD reads of ICC4958 were aligned on the previously described ICC4958 reference sequence by the Bioscope module of the tool HAPS (http://solidsoftwaretools.com/gf/project/haps/). The mapping output file of only the properly paired reads was then utilized by the SST scaffolding module of HAPS to produce a SOLiD read-based consensus sequence of ICC4958. Next, the SOLiD reads of C. reticulatum PI489777 were mapped onto the consensus sequence for SNP identification. Stringent criteria were used for SNP calling and only those SNPs were selected that had identical SNPs of 5X coverage and 0.6 confidence score and whose flanking regions were suitable for designing allele-specific and locus-specific primers for the Illumina GoldenGate Assay. These included only those SNPs which did not have other SNPs or indels in the 60-bp regions flanking it. Hence, a set of 920 candidate SNP loci were selected from the same number of contigs and were designated as CaSNPs. Additionally, by amplicon resequencing of 222 chickpea EST loci from C. arietinum and C. reticulatum, 102 EST-derived SNPs (designated as ESNPs) were identified for genotyping as described in Choudhary et al.48 Thus, from both the approaches, a total of 1022 SNPs (920 CaSNPs + 102 ESNPs) were identified for genotyping using the GoldenGate assay. All the 1022 SNPs and their flanking sequences are available in Supplementary Table S1. Moreover, the 1022 identified SNPs were classified as transitions (C/T and G/A) or transversions (C/G, T/A, A/C and G/T) based on nucleotide substitutions. In this analysis, higher rates of transition (almost double) in comparison with the rate of transversions were found, since 650 (63.65%) transitions were found in comparison with 372 (36.4%) transversions. Among the transitions, the [C/T] type was slightly more prevalent (334, 51.4%) than [G/A] that accounted for 316 (48.6%) of single base changes, whereas among transversions, T/A scored relatively higher (123) in comparison with other transversions.3.2. SNP genotypingThe 1022 SNPs were submitted to Illumina for the Oligo Pool All (OPA) design for use in the GoldenGate assay. Each of the individual SNPs was assigned an ADT designability score by Illumina, ranging from 0 to 1, where a score <0.4 predicted a low success rate, 0.4 to 0.6 a moderate success rate and >0.6 a high success rate for the conversion of an SNP into a successful GoldenGate assay. In all, 944 SNPs (851 CaSNPs and 93 ESNPs) were assigned designability scores =0.6, thereby resulting in the possibility of conversion of 92.37% of the predicted SNPs into successful GoldenGate assays. However, for convenience of customizing the array design, the 768 SNPs with the highest scores (=0.76) were selected for inclusion in the first chickpea 768-OPA, named as CpOPA-I (Supplementary Table 1). This CpOPA-I assay was utilized for genotyping of the 129 RIL individuals along with the parental lines of the reference mapping population.The genotyping data of the 768 SNPs across the 129 RILs were analysed using the GenomeStudio software (Illumina), which clusters and calls the data automatically, allowing visualization of the data directly for downstream analysis. For each SNP, the genotyping data representation included three main clusters corresponding to AA homozygote, AB heterozygote and BB homozygote. As in the present study, an F9-F10 RIL mapping population was used, which is expected to contribute very few heterozygotes, most of the SNP markers produced two main clusters representing the two homozygous genotypes, with sometimes a small additional cluster corresponding to heterozygous genotypes (Fig. 1A). A few data points were sometimes ambiguously located outside these clusters (indicated by arrows in Fig. 1A) and represented those for which no calls were generated and were therefore scored as missing data. In our genotyping data set, the average level of heterozygosity was 6.5%, expected for a RIL population, whereas the level of missing data per marker averaged at 5.6%.

Some data points located between or in the border of these clusters (marked by an arrow) are unsuccessfully genotyped samples for which no calls were generated and considered as missing data. (B) SNPs which were considered as false or monomorphic (failed to detect an SNP in the parents and the mapping population) that grouped into a single cluster (e.g. CaSNP917 and ESNP46). (C) Technically unsatisfactory SNPs (e.g. CaSNP61 and CaSNP226) represented by insufficient allele cluster separation.In the present study, of the 768 assays, 724 SNPs generated clearly defined, well-separated clusters (as in Fig. 1A), whereas the remaining 44 SNPs did not produce clear clustering patterns and were excluded from the linkage analysis. These consisted of 28 false or monomorphic SNPs (failed to detect an SNP in the parents and the mapping population) that grouped into a single cluster (Fig. 1B), and 16 SNPs that were classified as technically unsuccessful, since they had the GenTrain and GenCall50 score of <0.40, ‘no-call’ frequencies >5% and were represented by insufficient allele cluster separation (Fig. 1C). Further, of the 724 SNP assays that showed clear clustering, 27 were found to be heterozygous in at least one of the parents and hence were excluded from linkage analysis. Therefore in all, 697 SNPs (645 CaSNPs and 52 ESNPs) out of 768 SNPs were found to be successful, demonstrating a success rate of 90.75% for the Illumina GGGT in chickpea.3.3. SNP mappingFor construction of a dense genetic map of chickpea, the genotyping data of 697 polymorphic SNPs obtained from 129 RILs of the reference inter-specific mapping population (C. arietinum ICC4958 x C. reticulatum PI489777) were utilized. Further, to generate an integrated and advanced genetic map of chickpea, the genotyping data of the 697 SNPs were compiled along with the genotyping data of 368 co-dominant markers published previously by our group.48 These markers included 238 gSSRs (genomic SSRs), 52 EST-SSRs, 51 ITPs (Intron Targeted Polymorphism), 25 ESTPs and 2 MtESTs (Table 1), which served as a framework for anchoring the SNP loci. Hence, data of 1065 markers (697 SNPs and 368 previously mapped co-dominant markers) were compiled together for linkage analysis and map generation using JoinMap ver. 4.0.67 The resulting integrated linkage map of chickpea defined map positions of 1063 markers distributed over 8 linkage groups (Fig. 2). The current map spanned 1808.7 cM with an average inter-marker distance of 1.7 cM. The map contained an average of 1.43 map positions per Mb of genome (1063 map positions/740 Mb) and had one marker per 696 kb (740 Mb/1063) when considering the chickpea genome to be 740 Mb.44 The LGs were numbered (1 to 8) based on the common marker positions shared between corresponding LGs from previous studies.48,58 The genetic length of the LGs ranged from 186.8 cM (LG2) to 269.5 cM (LG1) (Table 2). LG3 was the most saturated, having 205 markers with an average marker density of 0.95 cM, whereas LG8 had the least number of markers (only 84) (Table 2). On an average, one linkage group contained 132.9 markers that spanned an average of 226 cM. All categories of markers including genic, genomic and SNPs were found on each of the LGs. However, the number of SNP markers in each of the LGs was maximum and varied in the range 65–75% except in LG7, which had only 38% SNP markers. The markers were unevenly and non-randomly distributed in the LGs and 25 clusters of markers (=5 markers within 1 cM distance) were identified of which 20 clusters comprise only SNP markers, whereas a single cluster on LG3 contained only STMS markers. Moreover, nine gaps ranging from 20 to 35 cM were observed in four LGs (LG1, LG5, LG7 and LG8) located near the distal ends. The <U+03C7>2 test performed resulted in segregation distortion for 42% (448) of the marker loci. However, 446 of these markers were finally integrated into the map so that the loss of genetic information related to these markers was minimized. Moreover, the distorted markers were found to be widely distributed throughout all the LGs even though the ratios varied from one LG to another. For example in LG1 and LG4, <25% markers showed distortion, whereas in others >30% of the mapped loci were distorted. The overall segregation distortion of 42% observed in this study was similar to the 41.3 and 38% reported earlier for the same mapping population.48,58Distribution of markers on the eight linkage groupsDistribution of markers on the eight linkage groupsInter-specific linkage map of chickpea.

Synteny between chickpea and other legumesTo identify the syntenic relationships between chickpea and other legume genomes, namely M. truncatula and G. max, the sequence information available for 917 of 1063 mapped loci on the current linkage map of chickpea was utilized (Table 3). These markers included 696 SNPs, 51 EST-SSRs, 94 gSSRs, 51 ITPs and 25 ESTPs for which locus sequences were available. The details about the markers on each of the chickpea linkage groups (CaLGs) that showed hits with chromosomes of G. max and M. truncatula are described in Table 3. Details of CaLGs, number of markers and synteny with M. truncatula and G. max chromosomesDetails of CaLGs, number of markers and synteny with M. truncatula and G. max chromosomesChickpea-Medicago synteny. The chickpea-Medicago synteny was observed for 315 (34.35%) of 917 markers for which 404 significant matches were obtained on different chromosomes of Medicago. Synteny blocks were observed between chickpea and most Medicago chromosomes except Mt6 (Supplementary Fig. S1), indicating an evolutionary relationship between the two species. Many of the CaLGs were found to have syntenic blocks with more than one LG of Medicago. CaLG3 showed maximum synteny, since 68 markers showed 86 hits with Medicago chromosomes (Table 3), majority of which (35 and 23) were located on Mt7 and Mt5, respectively (Fig. 3). Similarly, synteny blocks from CaLG2 were observed on Mt4, Mt5 and Mt6 (Fig. 3). Moreover, CaLG1, CaLG4 and CaLG5 showed distinct synteny with Mt2, Mt1 and Mt3 chromosomes, respectively (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). Additionally, CaLG6 and CaLG7 were seen to be highly syntenic with Mt8, whereas CaLG8 was found to be syntenic with Mt4 (Supplementary Figs. S1 and S2). The number of markers that found hits in Medicago in comparison with soybean was more; however, very limited collinearity was observed between the chickpea-Medicago syntenic blocks. Syntenic relationships of chickpea LGs: CaLG2 with Mt4, Mt5 and Mt6; CaLG3 with Mt5 and Mt7; CaLG1 with Gm9, Gm13 and Gm15; CaLG3 with Gm1, Gm3 and Gm19.

Coloured regions represent syntenic blocks observed in chromosomes of Medicago and soybean.Chickpea-soybean synteny. In chickpea-soybean synteny analysis, 272 (30%) markers found a larger number of hits (609) in the soybean genome (Table 3) in comparison with Medicago. However, regions with macrosynteny, microsynteny and collinearity were observed. All CaLGs showed syntenic blocks with Gm chromosomes except CaLG7 (Supplementary Fig. S1). In the case of soybean also (as with Medicago), CaLG3 (54 markers) found maximum hits (129) in the soybean genome, of which majority were found on Gm19, Gm3 and Gm1 (Table 3; Supplementary Fig. S3). All CaLGs (except CaLG7) showed multiple synteny blocks with the Gm chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S1). CaLG5 showed clear correspondence with regions in Gm4 and Gm6 in which the marker order was almost collinear. High collinearity was also observed between CaLG1 with Gm13, Gm15 and Gm9 (Fig. 3), followed by LG4 with Gm17. Similarly, collinear regions were also identified between CaLG6 and Gm5 and Gm8 (Supplementary Fig. S1).4. DiscussionThe present study of the chickpea genome reports the large-scale identification of SNPs from the NGS of two contrasting genotypes, which were parents of an RIL mapping population. The development and validation of the high-throughput GoldenGate SNP genotyping assay was demonstrated for the first time in chickpea with a very high success rate of 90.75% (since 697 of 768 SNPs were genotyped). Further, these SNPs were assigned map locations in the backdrop of other co-dominant markers to generate one of the most dense genetic linkage maps of chickpea, thereby clearly establishing the quality of the data and the utility of this approach. This study served to expand the repertoire of genomic resources in chickpea by providing the first set of 696 validated and mapped SNP markers, which are the most preferred next generation markers for molecular breeding, association studies and comparative genomics. Recently, there has been a spurt in the large-scale discovery of SNPs in plants, especially after the public availability of EST databases and more recently with the continuously expanding NGS of genomes and transcriptomes. SNP identification in plants range from a few thousand such as 1114 in wheat,15 2700 in Arabidopsis,69 5000 in tomato,40 6626 in pine,16 10 000 in cowpea,13 9194–36 000 in maize,17,42 22 000 in barley,32 25 000–39 022 in soybean,18,70 40 000 in Medicago19 and 67 051 in rice,71 to millions in Arabidopsis (2.5 million),72 rice (2.4–6.5 million),7,73Medicago (3 million)38 and soybean (6.5 million).74 The thousands of SNPs generated are being extensively used for various applications such as the analysis of genetic diversity,22,74 map construction13,15,32,40 and orienting the scaffolds in whole genome sequencing projects.18,43SNP discovery from de novo sequencing of genomes is a challenge especially in the absence of reference genomes. In the case of chickpea, since no reference genome was available, in the present study, SNPs were deduced by sequence comparisons between chickpea and its wild relative, C. reticulatum, with the aim of producing a highly useful set of molecular markers, which would be directly used for constructing a dense linkage map of chickpea. Consensus calling was done by de novo assembly of the Roche/454 long reads of C. arietinum ICC4958 to generate the reference sequence, onto which the ICC4958 SOLiD short reads were mapped to generate a consensus sequence. Next, SNP calling was done by mapping the SOLiD reads of the contrasting genotype, C. reticulatum PI489777, onto the consensus sequence. Moreover, in order to custom design a genotyping array consisting of SNPs well-distributed throughout the genome, a predetermined number of SNPs were selected from the largest sized contigs. This array proved useful for establishing the efficacy of the SNP genotyping strategy for high-resolution mapping, which is mandatory for MAS, association analysis and anchoring the chickpea genome.Many factors may be responsible for the overall success of SNP genotyping. Firstly, SNP prediction from NGS data should be based on stringent parameters. When calling variants (especially from short reads), the quantity of reads and the accuracy of mapping the reads should be precise. This was ensured in our data since we used stringent criteria for SNP calling such as base quality =20, minimum read depth of 5X in both genotypes and frequency score >0.6. Secondly, the nucleotides flanking the query SNP also influence the rate of success of SNP development.16,23 In our study also, care was taken to select only those SNPs that had no variations in the 60 bases flanking it. Moreover, the Illumina ADT which provides designability scores, checks for the presence of repetitive and palindromic sequences, GC content and sequence polymorphisms in the region flanking the query SNP. High designability scores were obtained for the 920 predicted chickpea SNPs of which 851 (92.5%) had an ADT designability score =0.6 indicating a high success rate for the conversion of an NGS-derived SNP into a GGGT assay. Even after combining with the 102 ESNPs, designability scores =0.6 were obtained for 92.37% of the predicted SNPs. From these, since only 768 SNPs had to be selected for the OPA design, those having scores =0.76 (much higher than the threshold values) were selected for the 768-CpOPA-I. Inclusion of SNPs with such high designability scores accounted for the overall success of the genotyping assay as has also been demonstrated in pine.16 Moreover, 48 CaSNPs predicted from the NGS data were experimentally validated by resequencing the alleles of the two parental varieties and a success rate of 87.5% was obtained (data not shown).In the present study, we also demonstrated that the high-throughput GoldenGate technology could be successfully used for genotyping predicted SNPs by conversion into working assays. This high-throughput platform of Illumina, which ensures a high level of multiplexing and reliability, has been suitably used in plants,12,13,16,32,33,75,76 where large numbers of SNPs need to be surveyed. In the present chickpea OPA, the success rate of 90.75% was obtained, which was comparable with the success rates of 89–92% reported in the previous studies in other crops such as barley,75 soybean,31 cowpea,13 maize33 and eucalyptus,20 and was higher than those reported in spruce12 and pine.16,34 The SNP success rate may be assessed in various ways and different SNP reliability thresholds may be used. The SNP success rate of 90.7% reported for chickpea was based on the percentage of successfully genotyped SNPs. However, if the criteria of the call rate (>95%) were used, the success rate of 99.8% was achieved. The success rate was 93.0% when considering the GenTrain and GenCall50 score of =0.4 as thresholds, as described in Grattapaglia et al.20We present here the first SNP-based linkage map of chickpea constructed using 697 SNPs in combination with 368 previously mapped co-dominant markers including a large number of SSRs (Fig. 2). In the past few years, SSR markers have been the most preferred markers for constructing linkage maps due to their hypervariability, co-dominant nature and reproducibility, and SSR-based maps have been constructed in many plants such as wheat,77 barley,78 tobacco,79 tomato80 and Catharanthus,81 and legumes like chickpea46,48 and soybean.82 However, SSRs were found to have limitations, since they were not sufficiently dense to provide the genomic coverage necessary for the dissection of complex traits. Moreover, automation in high-throughput genotyping of SSRs was not very common. Therefore, SNPs are now proposed as the most useful markers, especially for the construction of highly saturated maps, which may have very wide and novel applications in plant genomics. Hence, modern sequencing technologies are being used to generate thousands to millions of SNPs in many plant species as mentioned previously. However, when it comes to the validation of SNPs and their use in genotyping and map generation, there are only a few examples of SNP-based high-density maps. The map of chickpea generated in this study contained 697 SNPs—much higher than the 357 in pine,16 480 in wheat15 and 558 in grass,41 but lower than the 793 in tomato,40 928 in cowpea,13 1397 in soybean31 and 2943 in barley.32 In addition to the SNPs, 368 previously mapped co-dominant markers were positioned in this chickpea map thereby generating one of the most advanced integrated maps of chickpea comprising of 1063 markers with an average marker density of 1.7 cM. This map was more saturated in comparison to other published maps of chickpea such as those of Winter et al.58 (2077.9 cM: 303 markers: AMD of 6.8 cM), Nayak et al.45 (2602.1 cM: 521 markers: AMD of 4.99 cM), Gujaria et al.47 (766.56 cM: 300 markers: AMD of 2.552 cM) and Choudhary et al.48 (1497.7 cM; 406 markers; AMD of 3.68). A distinguishing feature of this map was that it was constructed based on a single reference population (not on integration of maps from different populations), utilizing actual segregation data of each of the genomic and genic markers listed in Table 1. Consensus maps are generated in order to increase the number of mapped markers, but may compromise on the accuracy of the marker order. Hence our map may be considered as more accurate regarding the marker order on the eight linkage groups. This was confirmed as considerable conservation of marker distribution existed between the LGs of the current map and our previous map48 as well as the anchor map of Winter et al.58 Moreover, this map was a major advancement over previous maps based on co-dominant markers,45,47,48 as the mapped markers were more than doubled in the current map. Additionally, nine genic markers (four EST-SSRs, two ITPs and three ESTPs), which remained unmapped in our previous inter-specific map, were also mapped onto LG2, LG3, LG5, LG6, LG7 and LG8 in the current map. The average marker density in each of the LGs in the current map was also found to be increased (0.95–2.65) in comparison with the density reported earlier (1.77–8.01).48 Therefore, it was envisaged that this highly advanced map would not only be useful in chickpea breeding but would particularly aid and complement the efforts of orienting scaffolds of chickpea whole genome sequence being generated during its de novo sequencing at the institute. High-resolution genetic maps are critical for the assembly of sequence scaffolds into pseudomolecules corresponding to chromosomes of organisms and have been used for anchoring and orienting scaffolds in the soybean,18 watermelon,43 grape,83 cucumber84 and apple85 whole genome sequencing.Genomic synteny can facilitate the transfer of genetic information especially between orphan and model crops. In legumes, map-based synteny has been shown in several studies such as cowpea,13Medicago,86 peanut,87 common bean88 and asparagus bean.89 However, due to the lack of genomic resources, information on genome organization and comparative analysis was limited in chickpea. In this study, comparative analysis of chickpea using genic and genomic marker sequences with the model legume Medicago and soybean was done, which revealed higher levels of synteny with Medicago in comparison with soybean. This result indicated that the degree of synteny declines with increasing phylogenetic distance, as chickpea and Medicago both belong to the Galegoid clade, whereas soybean belongs to the Phaseoloid clade. Chromosomal rearrangements seemed to have occurred since most of the chickpea LGs were chimeric to two or more Gm chromosomal segments. Moreover, some segments of chickpea such as those on CaLG3 were found to have blocks on two Gm chromosomes (Gm3 and Gm19), thereby indicating the phenomenon of genome duplication.In conclusion, the present study illustrates the application of NGS technology for the large-scale identification of SNPs from species without reference genomes such as chickpea. It also demonstrates that the high-throughput genotyping technologies such as the Illumina GoldenGate assay can be successfully used for genotyping and subsequently mapping the SNPs and integrating them with other co-dominant markers for the construction of a dense genetic map of chickpea. The availability of such large numbers of SNP markers, advanced genotyping technologies and the high-density marker map would serve as a foundation not only for orienting and anchoring of scaffolds arising out of whole genome sequencing projects but also for association mapping and synteny-based genomics in chickpea and other legumes.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available online atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingWe gratefully acknowledge the funding support by the Department of Biotechnology (DBT), Government of India, through their research grant (BT/PR12919/AGR/02/676/2009) for this work.We are thankful to Dr Fred Muehlbauer, Washington State University, USA, for providing the inter-specific chickpea mapping population and genotypic data of published STMS markers.Supplementary data"

IntroductionAspergillus oryzae has been utilized for over 1000 years in Japan for the production of various traditional foods, including soy sauce, sake (rice wine), soybean paste, and vinegar. Various A. oryzae strains have been isolated and/or selected for the effective degradation of target materials during the fermentation. In relation to a wide range of fermentation products produced by A. oryzae, genetic alteration between A. oryzae species is of particular interest.As a wild-type strain of A. oryzae, the genome sequence of A. oryzae RIB40 [37 Mb; the National Research Institute of Brewing (NRIB), Japan; NITE Biological Resource Center (NBRC) stock no. 100959; American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) no. 42149] was completed1 and compared with those of Aspergillus nidulans (30 Mb)2 and Aspergillus fumigatus (29 Mb),3 revealing that the A. oryzae genome could be characterized into distinct syntenic blocks (SBs) and non-SBs (NSBs). Because the three species are phylogenetically closely related, SBs occupy ~70–80% of the three genomes.2 NSBs are considered to be unique genetic elements of individual species, and the A. oryzae genome has the largest total size of NSBs (Fig. 1). Organizations of SBs and NSBs in the A. oryzae, A. fumigatus, and A. nidulans genomes. SBs, which were identified from syntenic analysis between A. oryzae, A. fumigatus, and A. nidulans,1 are common between the genomes, whereas NSBs in A. oryzae consist of the extra genetic regions from other two smaller genome sequences.Organizations of SBs and NSBs in the A. oryzae, A. fumigatus, and A. nidulans genomes. SBs, which were identified from syntenic analysis between A. oryzae, A. fumigatus, and A. nidulans,1 are common between the genomes, whereas NSBs in A. oryzae consist of the extra genetic regions from other two smaller genome sequences.Compared with NSBs found in the genomes of yeast and other filamentous fungi, NSBs of A. oryzae show the significant enrichment of genes involved in metabolism, including secondary metabolism, hydrolase, and transporter genes,1 and contain genes that are less conserved than those of SBs.4 In general, the transcriptional expression of NSB genes is markedly weaker than that of genes located in SBs; however, several NSB genes functioning as secretory hydrolases and transporters are highly induced in solid-state cultivation and reach absolute expression levels comparable with those of SB genes.5 Another characteristic feature of NSB genes is that they are often repressed by heat shock.5 Together, these findings indicate that SBs and NSBs represent distinct genetic segments in the A. oryzae genome in terms of biological function, diversity, and transcriptional regulation, and NSBs can contribute to a wide range of fermentation capability of A. oryzae strains.6 However, a difference of genetic alterations between SBs and NSBs remains unclear.To reveal mutational characteristics of NSBs, we sequenced the genome of A. oryzae RIB326 and compared it with strain RIB40. RIB326 was isolated from an industrial A. oryzae strain isolated from shoyu koji (inocula for soy sauce fermentation) in a conida supplier (Osaka-Konno), independently from RIB40.7,8 We considered that a genomic comparison of the two strains would help understand the development of mutations during the domestication process, particularly relating to NSBs containing genes responsible for fermentation and secondary metabolism.42. Materials and Methods2.1. Strain and mediumThe fungal strain used in this study, A. oryzae RIB326, was obtained from the National Research Institute of Brewing, Japan (http://www.nrib.go.jp/ken/asp/strain.html). For DNA isolation, the fungus was grown in liquid yeast extract peptone dextrose medium (Difco) at 30°C for 2 days.2.2. DNA preparationGenomic DNA was isolated from RIB326 by first grinding mycelia to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen, and then mixing ~40 g of the ground mycelia with 200 ml of 10 mM Tris buffer (pH 7.0) containing 50 mM ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 200 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and 10 mg each of cellulase (Yakuruto), yatalase (Takara) and lysing enzyme (Sigma). The mixture was incubated for 1 h at 37°C, followed by the addition of RNase A (Funakoshi) to a final concentration of 20 mg/ml and further incubation for 1 h. After the addition of proteinase K (Takara) to a final concentration of 0.1 mg/ml, the solution was incubated for 2 h at 50°C, followed by centrifugation at 2300 × g for 10 min. The resulting supernatant was subjected to phenol, phenol/chloroform and chloroform extraction, and DNA was then precipitated using ethanol. After dissolving the precipitated DNA in Tris-EDTA buffer, genomic DNA was purified using a Genomic-tip column (Qiagen).2.3. Sequencing and assembly of the A. oryzae RIB326 genome using a next-generation sequencing systemThe whole genome sequencing of RIB326 using both fragment and mate-paired libraries was performed using the SOLiD system (ABI), a next-generation sequencing system, according to the manufacturer's instruction. Fragment sequencing yielded 70 268 590 sequence reads of 50 bp, whose depth on the reference sequence of RIB40 [~37 Mb, DNA Data Bank of Japan (DDBJ): AP007150–AP007177; GenBank: AP007150–AP007177] was 67 and covered 94.6% of the reference nucleotide sequence after mapping. The mate-paired sequencing yielded 86 209 971 sequence reads of 50 bp, which were subjected to de novo assembly using Velvet (version 1.0.15)9 on a DELL Precision T7500 (CPU: Xeon E5620, memory: 96 GB, hard disk: 2 TB × 5, OS: Ubuntu Linux 10.04). The assembled scaffolds had a total length of 36 395 679 bp; N50 length of 643 359 bp; and mean length of 7286 bp. N50 is defined as the scaffold length such that using equal or longer scaffolds produces half the bases of all scaffolds. The longest scaffold had a length of 2 218 714 bp. The sequences of the longest 200 scaffolds are available in the DDBJ (BAEZ01000001–BAEZ01000200).2.4. Nucleotide mutation analysis between strains RIB40 and RIB326Conserved sequences and nucleotide alterations in strain RIB326 were analyzed using Corona-Lite software (Version 4.2) with the RIB40 genome sequence as a reference. Genome sequence rearrangements between strains RIB40 and RIB326 were analyzed using the longest 200 scaffolds of RIB326 determined from de novo assembly. The 200 scaffolds represent 35 425 415 bp (97.3%) of the total length of the entire RIB326 assembly. Homology searches of the 200 RIB326 scaffolds against 22 RIB40 scaffolds using the LAST algorithm10–12 generated 5521 pairs of nucleotide sequences having scores and identities of >500 and >98%, respectively. Deletions, insertions and inversions of longer than 500 bp in the RIB326 scaffolds were counted. For the display of the RIB40 genome, sequences of the 22 scaffolds were concatenated as one continuous sequence with an artificial N sequence of 10 kb between the neighbouring scaffolds. The final length of the RIB40 genome sequence was determined to be 37 268 201 bp.2.5. Analysis of mutation frequency in coding sequences between RIB40 and RIB326To identify coding sequences (CDSs) in RIB326, each amino acid sequence of RIB40 genes was subjected to tBlastn searches13,14 against the nucleotide sequence of the RIB326 genome. Each codon of RIB40 CDS was compared with the corresponding RIB326 codons, and codons were classified as either with or without mutation(s), or containing unidentified nucleotide(s). Codons with mutation(s) were further classified as those without (silent) or with (non-silent) amino acid substitutions.2.6. Expressed sequence tagsAspergillus oryzae expressed sequence tags (ESTs) generated under eight culture conditions15 were obtained from http://riodb.ibase.aist.go.jp/ffdb/EST-DB.html. The eight culture conditions were: (i) liquid nutrient-rich culture, (ii) liquid nutrient-rich culture at high temperature, (iii) liquid maltose-inductive culture, (iv) liquid carbon-starved culture, (v) liquid germinated conidia and conidia, (vi) alkaline pH culture on agar plates, (vii) solid-state wheat bran culture, and (viii) solid-state soybean culture (for details, see Akao et al.15). Gene numbers and averaged amino acid substitution ratios were evaluated for SBs and NSBs for each EST level. The Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to evaluate the P-value for differences between the amino acid substitution ratios of SBs and NSBs for each EST level when more than four genes were at the EST level in both SBs and NSBs.2.7. Eukaryotic orthologous group classification of CDSsThe functional categories of A. oryzae genes were assigned according to the eukaryotic orthologous group (KOG) classification16 by searching for homology against amino acid sequences in the KOG database with a bit score of =60. The genes categorized as belonging to more than one KOG category were counted for every relevant category. The 22 KOG categories were classified into three meta-categories: I, information storage and processing; II, cellular process and signalling; and III, metabolism. The three meta-categories include the following categories. Meta-category I: J, translation, ribosomal structure, and biogenesis; A, RNA processing and modification; K, transcription; L, replication, recombination, and repair; and B, chromatin structure and dynamics; meta-category II: D, Cell cycle control, cell division, and chromosome partitioning; V, defense mechanisms; T, signal transduction mechanisms; M, cell wall/membrane/envelope biogenesis; Z, cytoskeleton; U, intracellular trafficking, secretion, and vesicular transport; O, post-translational modification, protein turnover, and chaperones; Y, nuclear structure; and W, extracellular structures; meta-category III: C, energy production and conversion; G, carbohydrate transport and metabolism; E, amino acid transport and metabolism; F, nucleotide transport and metabolism; H, coenzyme transport and metabolism; I, lipid transport and metabolism; P, inorganic ion transport and metabolism; and Q, secondary metabolite biosynthesis, transport, and catabolism.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Are mutations localized in NSB or only in sub-telomeric region?To grasp genetic alterations between the two A. oryzae strains, the localization of nucleotide alterations and amino acid substitutions between RIB326 and RIB40 were mapped on the RIB40 genome (Fig. 2). In regions proximal to centromeres, a decrease in the nucleotide substitution frequency was observed, indicating that these regions are subjected to strong selective pressure. In contrast, the nucleotide substitution ratio was higher in regions proximal to chromosomal termini (sub-telomeric regions). This result is in good agreement with the fact that the sub-telomeric regions of yeast and humans are unstable due to telomere loss and thus, accumulate mutations at a higher rate.17–19 In Caenorhabditis elegans, the single-nucleotide polymorphism density on the chromosomal terminus was ~4.5-fold more abundant than that found on the central part of the chromosome.20 The location of mutations appears to be correlated with NSBs, which are generally localized proximal to chromosomal termini. Pairwise comparison of the genes between the two genomes showed that only 1.2% of RIB326 genes had more than 20% deletions/substitutions of amino acids from corresponding RIB40 genes. Therefore, almost all SBs and NSBs in RIB326 are located at the same positions of those in RIB40 and the higher mutation frequency in NSBs is consistent using either RIB326 or RIB40 genomes. Distribution of mutations in the RIB326 genome. (a) The nucleotide substitution percentage and (b) amino acid conservation ratio in the A. oryzae RIB40 genome against RIB326 were plotted using a 10-kb window with a 5-kb overlap. Each chromosomal region (I–VIII) is indicated by dark green stepwise line located at the bottom of the graph, and the position of the centromere in each chromosome deduced from the terminal of scaffolds is indicated by red arrows. The short vertical gray lines located in at the middle of the figure represent the position of NSBs determined from syntenic analysis between A. oryzae, A. nidulans, and A. fumigatus.1Distribution of mutations in the RIB326 genome.

The analysis revealed that genes containing mutations were ~10% more frequent within NSBs than those located in SBs and were more prevalent when excluding genes closest (100 or 500 kb) from chromosomal termini (Fig. 3a). Similarly, the amino acid substitution ratio of all NSB genes was higher than that observed in SB genes and further increased on the exclusion of genes located closest to termini (Fig. 3b). These results indicate that NSBs accumulate a greater number of mutations than SBs regardless of the chromosomal location. Mutation of SB and NSB genes in relation to the distance from chromosomal termini. The percentages of (a) genes with mutation and (b) averaged amino acid substitutions are shown for all SB and NSB genes located in the genome, and those located greater than 100- or 500-kb distant from the closest chromosomal termini.Mutation of SB and NSB genes in relation to the distance from chromosomal termini.

Table 1 summarizes the number and ratio of deletions, insertions, and inversions in the RIB40 genome sequence against that of RIB326, which were determined using the longest 200 scaffolds (>576 bp) obtained by sequencing of the mate-paired library of RIB326. Notably, 24.2 and 19.8% of the deletions and inversions, respectively, were found within NSBs on the RIB40 genome. Considering that the nucleotides defined as NSBs occupy only 12.4% of the entire genome sequence of RIB40, the results indicate that deletions and inversions are highly enriched in NSBs of A. oryzae.

Are NSB genes functionally active?Figure 5 shows the number of genes and frequency of amino acid substitutions for genes located within SBs and NSBs against the redundancy of ESTs, which were previously obtained from eight different cultural conditions.15 Our analysis revealed that the percentage of genes within SBs and NSBs decreased as the EST level increased, with the number of NSB genes decreasing at a higher rate than that of SB genes (Fig. 5a). This result is in good agreement with the finding that NSB genes typically have markedly lower expression levels than those of SB genes.4 Nevertheless, a small percentage of NSB genes was detected at EST levels of >10, indicating that several genes within NSBs are functional. As shown in Figure 5b, the average amino acid substitution ratios were significantly (P< 0.05) higher for NSB genes than those of SB genes at any EST level, when greater than four genes were available for the analysis. This result demonstrates that the genes within NSBs accumulated more mutations than those within SBs, even those that exhibited high-expression levels.

(a) Gene numbers and (b) averaged amino acid substitution frequencies within SBs and NSBs are plotted against the level of EST.

Asterisks indicate a P-value of <0.05 in the graph of NSBs.Gene number and averaged amino acid substitution ratios within SBs and NSBs of strain RIB326 against gene expression levels.

The P-values for the difference between the amino acid substitution ratios within SBs and NSBs were evaluated using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test for each EST level that included greater than four genes. Asterisks indicate a P-value of <0.05 in the graph of NSBs.The amino acid substitution frequency within the RIB326 genome was calculated to evaluate the activity of NSB genes. The number of genes with silent or non-silent mutations, and the ratio of mutated genes within SBs and NSBs is summarized in Table 2. Based on the amino acid frequency within A. oryzae genes, the probability of a synonymous mutation would only be 5.4% when a random point mutation mechanism is assumed (see the frequency within A. oryzae genes and probability of silent mutations for each amino acid in the Supplementary data). However, the ratio of genes with silent mutations was much more abundant (55–58%) than that of genes with non-silent mutations in both SBs and NSBs. This finding demonstrates that the NSB genes of strain RIB326 are functionally active, even though they accumulated more mutations than the SB genes. Number and ratio of silent and non-silent mutations in SBs and NSBs of A. oryzae RIB326Number and ratio of silent and non-silent mutations in SBs and NSBs of A. oryzae RIB326Comparison of the sequences showed ~5.4% of RIB40 nucleotides unidentified by the reads from RIB326, among which continuous unidentified nucleotides of >500 bp occupy 3.3%. As a control, we confirmed that SOLiD short reads from RIB40 covered 99.94% of the RIB40 reference nucleotides. Further, long deletions (>30 kb) in RIB326 compared with RIB40 reached ~3.3%, which was identified by a preliminary comparative genomic hybridization experiment using a DNA microarray having single probes for each RIB40 gene (data not shown). The comparison of the sequences also showed 0.32% of the RIB40 nucleotides being substituted in the RIB326 genome. Notably, these frequencies were markedly reduced within CDS compared with the non-CDS regions. The ratio of deleted nucleotides was only 3.6% in exons, but reached 5.9 and 4.7% in the intergenic and intron regions, respectively. Similarly, the substitution ratio was 0.26% in exons, whereas intergenic and intron regions displayed ratios of 0.38 and 0.37%, respectively. These observations indicate the existence of selective pressure on CDS located within both NSBs and SBs.3.3. What are the role of NSBs in regard to gene function?Figure 6 depicts the gene numbers and mean amino acid substitution frequencies of SB and NSB genes for the major functional categories of the KOG of proteins.16 The number of NSB genes belonging to meta-category I, which represents information storage and processing, was significantly smaller than that of SB genes (Fig. 6a). The number of NSB genes belonging to meta-category III, which includes secondary metabolism genes (Q), hydrolases, and transporters, was significantly greater than the other two meta-categories (Fig. 6a). This result is in accordance with our previous finding that NSBs are the regions where secretory hydrolases and secondary metabolic genes unique to A. oryzae.5 In addition, it was determined that the amino acid substitution frequency was higher within NSBs for all examined functional categories (Fig. 6b).

In (b), the values for categories that did not include =10 genes were not drawn to avoid misinterpretation of biological insignificance.As secondary metabolic pathways are not directly involved in the growth, development, or reproduction of fungi, it is considered that mutations which alter or reduce the activity of these pathways do not markedly affect survival, whereas functional mutations in primary metabolic pathways are often lethal. Such mutations in secondary metabolic genes might increase survival rates through the production of new compounds that prevent the growth of other organisms. NSBs may serve as a diverse gene pool for promoting niche adaptation by accumulating genetic alterations.It is presently unknown why NSBs are widely distributed over the chromosomes of A. oryzae. The distributed regions might be suitable for secondary metabolic regulation by global regulatory factors such as LaeA and CclA, which function as histone methyltransferases.21,22 Our genomic sequencing revealed that RIB326 possesses the biosynthetic genes for kojic acid (AO090113000136), containing two silent mutations, and those for penicillin (AO090038000544). However, although RIB40 is known to produce both kojic acid23 and penicillin24 RIB326 does not produce either compound. The inability of RIB326 to produce these two secondary metabolites is thought to be due to the lack of expression of the respective biosynthetic genes and/or lack of biosynthetic precursor(s). RIB326, which was selected from an industrial strain for fermentation, generally produces less extrolites than RIB40.7,8 Mutations in RIB326 may have accumulated during the selective breeding of this strain for the reduced production of secondary metabolites during fermentation.Among extensive comparative studies between A. oryzae strains examining the productivity of hydrolases, amylases, proteases,25–27 and biosynthetic homologues of cyclopiazonic acid28,29 and aflatoxin,7,8,30,31, this represented the first genome-wide comparison between A. oryzae strains. It is possible that the higher mutation frequency of NSBs, which are enriched for secretory hydrolases and secondary metabolic genes, contributes to the introduction of unique characteristics into A. oryzae strains for niche adaptation. From an industrial point of view, the wide diversity of A. oryzae strains, which may have resulted from the high-mutation frequency of NSBs, might allow for effective breeding for specific fermentation applications by introducing unique metabolism for raw material degradation and/or flavour improvement.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported in part by the Okinawa Cutting-Edge Genome Project.Supplementary data"

IntroductionEconomically exploitable phosphate rock, the major source of industrial phosphorus, is estimated to be depleted in 50–100 years.1,2 Nevertheless, wasted phosphorus is rarely reused and, to make matters worse, can induce eutrophication in the surrounding water. Polyphosphate accumulating organisms (PAOs) are expected to help solve these problems. PAOs are frequently found in activated sludges in the enhanced biological phosphate removal (EBPR) process, where they are believed to play a pivotal role in phosphorus removal from the wastewater.3 The EBPR process is also attracting interest for its potential use in phosphorus recycling.4,5 In the EBPR process, PAOs take up phosphate into the cells and accumulate it as polyphosphate (polyP) under aerobic conditions. In addition, under subsequent anaerobic conditions, PAOs in such sludges are thought to accumulate polyhydroxyalkanoates (PHAs), at the expense of polyP hydrolysis,3 using volatile fatty acids such as acetate as substrates.To date, the features of PAOs have been studied mainly in bacterial communities,6–8 because few such microorganisms have been successfully isolated from EBPR sludge. Proteobacteria and/or actinobacteria are frequently observed in activated EBPR sludges, and several proteobacteria, e.g. Acinetobacter spp. and Lampropedia spp., have been isolated, although their metabolic or morphological characteristics differ from those typically observed in activated sludges.3 Besides these bacterial isolates, an unculturable proteobacterium, ‘Candidatus Accumulibacter phosphatis’, is regarded as a typical PAO based on its PolyP and PHA accumulation properties.7 Because ‘Ca. Accumulibacter phosphatis’ can predominate in an EBPR community fed with acetate or propionate, such sludges have been used for metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses.9–11 In this way, the molecular information of polyP accumulating proteobacteria has gradually been accumulating.Less is known about the cellular and molecular features of actinobacterial PAOs. Two species, Microlunatus phosphovorus and Tetrasphaera elongata, have been isolated from EBPR-activated sludges as candidate PAOs.12–15 These actinobacteria aerobically accumulate polyP in their cells, as do proteobacterial PAOs. Microlunatus phosphovorus, in particular, accumulates substantially more polyP (>10% of cell mass as phosphorus on a dry weight basis) than T. elongata (<1%) and other proteobacterial PAOs. Unlike proteobacterial PAOs, these candidates do not release phosphate when fed with acetate.12,15,16 Instead, glucose and mixed substrates (acetate, casamino acids, and yeast extract) induce phosphate release in M. phosphovorus and T. elongata, respectively. Although PHA synthesis in M. phosphovorus had not been observed for over a decade from its first isolation, Aker et al.17 recently demonstrated the presence of PHA in M. phosphovorus cells using PHA staining and gas chromatography, suggesting the existence of some metabolic systems for PHA production.In the present study, we determined the complete nucleotide sequence of the M. phosphovorus NM-1T (NBRC 101784T) genome. We put particular focus on (i) polyP synthesis and degradation, (ii) polyP transport, (iii) retention of polyP granules (volutin granules), and (iv) PHA synthesis, which are all considered to be essential traits of a typical PAO. Very recently, the whole genome sequence of ‘Ca. Accumulibacter phosphatis’ was made available (INSD accession number: CP001715). We discuss similarities and differences between these two genome-sequenced organisms. This report is the first detailed analysis of the whole genome sequences of PAOs.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Genome sequencing, assembly, and gap closureThe complete genome sequence of M. phosphovorus NM-1T (NBRC 101784T) was determined using a conventional whole genome shotgun strategy, as described previously.18 Shotgun libraries with average insert sizes of 1.5 and 6.0 kb were constructed in pUC118 vector (TaKaRa, Kyoto, Japan), and a fosmid library with an average insert size of 35 kb was constructed in pCC1FOS vector. Plasmid and fosmid clones were end-sequenced using dye-terminator chemistry on an ABI 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Raw sequence data corresponding to the 8.6-fold coverage were assembled using PHRED/PHRAP/CONSED software.19 Gaps between assembled sequences were closed either by primer walking on gap-spanning library clones or by the transposon-mediated random insertion method on bridging fosmid clones with a Template Generation System II Kit (Finnzymes, Vantaa, Finland).2.2. Gene identification and annotationPutative non-translated genes were identified using Rfam,20 tRNAscan-SE,21 and ARAGORN22 programs. To predict protein-coding genes, GLIMMER323 was used. The initial set of open reading frames (ORFs) was manually selected from the predictions in combination with the similarity search results. Similarity searches against the Uniprot,24 Interpro,25 and HAMAP26 databases were used for the functional prediction of ORFs. The KEGG27 database was used for pathway reconstruction.2.3. Data availabilityThe nucleotide sequence of M. phosphovorus NM-1T (NBRC 101784T) has been deposited in the INSD database with an accession number AP012204. The annotated genome sequence is also available in the genome database DOGAN (http://www.bio.nite.go.jp/dogan/project/view/MP1).3. Results and discussion3.1. General informationThe genome consisted of a single circular chromosome of 5 683 123 bp with an average G + C content of 67.3% (Fig. 1). No plasmid DNA sequence was detected. The chromosome was predicted to encode 5360 protein-coding genes, 46 transfer RNA genes, and a set of ribosomal RNA genes (16S, 23S, and 5S). Of the 5360 predicted protein-coding genes, 4887 (91%) were orthologous or had similarity to genes of known function or to hypothetical genes (E-value of <0.001), and the remaining 473 (9%) showed no significant similarity to any registered genes. After manual curation, 1999 (37%) genes could be assigned to known biological roles. Microlunatus phosphovorus harboured only a single rRNA operon, a significant finding given its relatively large genome. The general features of the M. phosphovorus genome are compared with those of 14 other actinobacterial species in Supplementary Table S1. In this comparison, target genomes were selected to represent each taxonomic rank from the genus Microlunatus stepwise to the class Actinobacteria. Supplementary Table S2 shows the distribution of ORFs in COG functional categories. No significant overrepresentation or underrepresentation of any particular functional category in M. phosphovorus was observed except that a higher percentage of ORFs was categorised as ‘function unknown’ in M. phosphovorus than in other actinobacteria.

From the periphery toward the centre, circles indicate the scale in Mbp, ORFs predicted on the forward and reverse strands, tRNA genes, rRNA operon, G + C contents, and GC skew.Microlunatus phosphovorus NM-1T is an obligately aerobic chemoorganotroph but can grow anaerobically if nitrate is added to the medium as an electron acceptor.13 Consistent with this observation, we found a gene cluster that putatively encodes subunits of the membrane-bound respiratory nitrate reductase, NarG (MLP_46640), NarH (MLP_46650), NarJ (MLP_46660), and NarI (MLP_46670), linked to a NarK-type nitrate/nitrite transporter gene (MLP_46680). In addition, we found a gene that encodes another NarK-type nitrate/nitrite transporter (MLP_35250) located the downstream of putative assimilatory nitrite reductase genes (MLP_35260 and MLP_35270). These components together may constitute a system for nitrate respiration in anaerobic conditions as well as for nitrogen assimilation. Under anaerobic conditions, M. phosphovorus NM-1T was reported to generate acetate from glucose, suggesting the presence of an acetate fermentation system.28 In support of previous experimental data,28 we found putative genes, pta-ackA (MLP_01330 and MLP_01320), encoding phosphate acetyltransferase and acetate kinase, which usually ferment acetate in bacteria. Furthermore, putative pflBA genes (MLP_33410 and MLP_33420), which are necessary for the synthesis and activation of pyruvate formate lyase, a central enzyme in anaerobic glucose metabolism, were found in the M. phosphovorus genome. Because pflBA genes are present in few lineages of actinobacteria, and because an IS-like sequence, a putative transposase gene flanked by 17-bp inverted repeat sequences, was present just upstream of the pflBA genes, pflBA could have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer.Metabolic pathways reconstructed in this study were roughly in accordance with previous studies on nutrient use in M. phosphovorus NM-1T (Supplementary Table S3).13,29–31 However, while lactose and malate were predicted to be used as nutrients based on the genome information, the growth of M. phosphovorus NM-1T on these nutrients has not been observed. On the other hand, while growth has been experimentally shown on mannose, galactose, n-acetyl-d-glucosamine, sorbose, salicin, p-arbutin, dulcitol, and adonitol, metabolic pathways for the use of these compounds were either missing or incomplete. Other substrates that have not yet been experimentally investigated, such as formate and butyrate, might also be used based on the predicted pathways. Butyrate metabolism may be advantageous for PAOs because butyrate, as well as acetate, could be a major fatty acid available in sewage water, and butyrate was consumed when nitrate is added under anaerobic conditions in an activated sludge sample.323.2. Predicted features as a PAOAs described above, M. phosphovorus NM-1T aerobically accumulates polyP in its cells, and phosphorus can exceed 10% of the cell mass on a dry weight basis.13 In addition, the rate of phosphorus release under anaerobic conditions is significantly higher in M. phosphovorus NM-1T than in any other isolated PAO candidate.12,28,33–35 The following sections describe the gene products that were implicated in the accumulation, degradation, and high turnover rate of polyP in M. phosphovorus.PolyP kinase (PPK) catalyses the transfer of phosphate between nucleoside phosphates and polyP. There are three main subtypes of PPK, PPK1, PPK2, and polyP-dependent AMP phosphotransferase (PAP), and they are present in a wide variety of bacterial species.36 Even though the reaction catalysed by PPK is reversible, PPK1 favours polyP synthesis with nucleoside triphosphates as phosphate donors, and thus PPK1 is recognized to play a principal role in polyP accumulation. On the other hand, PAP favours polyP hydrolysis. The PPK2 subtype also catalyses polyP hydrolysis, but the dominance of either kinase or phosphatase activity varies in different actinobacterial species; Corynebacterium glutamicum PPK2 is a polyP kinase and Mycobacterium tuberculosis PPK2 is a polyP phosphatase.37–39Four putative PPK genes were identified in the M. phosphovorus genome; a single ppk1 (MLP_47700) and three ppk2 (MLP_05750, MLP_50300, and MLP_23310) homologues. The number of ppk homologues in M. phosphovorus was relatively large; usually 1–4 ppk homologues exist in an actinobacterial genome (Table 1). Based on the similarity of deduced amino acid sequences, one of the M. phosphovorus PPK2s (MLP_05750) was of the C. glutamicum type (63% identity), whereas the other (MLP_50300) was of the Myc. tuberculosis type (78% identity; Fig. 2a). The third ppk2 homologue (MLP_23310) was relatively similar to both ppk2 and pap, but was located in a distinct cluster of undetermined function (Fig. 2a).

The possible importance of multiple PPK genes was supported by the genome information of ‘Ca. Accumulibacter phosphatis’. ‘Ca. Accumulibacter phosphatis’ harbours multiple putative PPK genes, a ppk1, four ppk2, and a pap, while proteobacterial species usually contain only one or two ppk subtypes.3.2.1.2. ExopolyphosphataseExopolyphosphatase (PPX) mediates the hydrolysis of the terminal phosphate of polyP.36 Two types of PPX, PPX1 and PPX2, are present in a wide variety of bacteria and archaea.36 Although most actinobacterial species harbour both types of PPX, only the ppx2 homologue (MLP_44770) was found in the M. phosphovorus genome (Fig. 2b). Propionibacterium acnes, which also belongs to the family Propionibacteriaceae, does not harbour ppx1 either. In C. glutamicum, which was recently shown to form volutin granules, mutational analysis showed that the amount of polyP in the cells increased when one of these genes was mutated.40 In contrast to M. phosphovorus, ‘Ca. Accumulibacter phosphatis’, the proteobacterial PAO, has two ppx homologues in its genome.Glucokinase is a key enzyme that catalyses phosphorylation of glucose, the first reaction of glycolysis. Glucokinase is widely present in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes.41 In almost all organisms, glucokinase uses ATP as the sole phosphoryl donor. In some actinobacterial species, however, a paralogue of glucokinase, polyP-dependent glucokinase (PPGK), has been identified which uses polyP as the phosphoryl donor as well as ATP.42–46 In C. glutamicum, western blot analysis showed that putative PPGK was localized in the volutin granules, suggesting that PPGK uses polyP from those granules.47 A PPGK has already been identified in M. phosphovorus NM-1T.48 That report showed that the PPGK was strictly polyP-specific, unlike other actinobacterial PPGKs, suggesting the importance of polyP as an energy source for M. phosphovorus.In the present study, three genes putatively encoding glucokinase were identified in the M. phosphovorus genome; one was putative ATP-dependent glk (MLP_41670) and another (MLP_05430) was the ppgK reported previously.48 The third gene (MLP_26610) was inferred to also be ppgK by molecular phylogenetic analysis (Fig. 2c). Internal deletions characteristic of PPGKs, as well as other functional motifs including the possible polyP-binding site, were observed in the deduced amino acid sequence of MLP_26610 (Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting that MLP_26610 is another ppgK orthologue (hereafter MLP_05430 and MLP_26610 are designated ppgK1 and ppgK2, respectively). This is the first report of two ppgK orthologues being present in a single organism (Table 1). In the presence of glucose, M. phosphovorus may use the dual ppgKs for efficient glycolysis by consuming intracellular polyP, which is then followed by acetate fermentation (see the ‘Adaptation in anaerobic conditions’ section) to adapt to anaerobic environments. This notion agrees well with the observation that adding glucose to a pure culture of M. phosphovorus NM-1T under anaerobic conditions resulted in a rapid release of Pi from the cells.12,16For rapid polyP metabolism, M. phosphovorus must have efficient phosphate uptake and release. In bacteria, phosphate uptake commonly occurs via the phosphate-specific transport (Pst) and phosphate inorganic transport (Pit) systems.49 The Pst is an ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, encoded by the gene cluster pstSCAB, for active Pit, while the Pit is a symporter of divalent metal-chelated phosphate (MeHPO4) and H+. In some Gram-negative bacteria, another ABC transporter, PhnCDE, has been identified.50–52 Recently, the PhnCDE transport system was also identified in an actinobacterium, Mycobacterium smegmatis,53 although the system is not commonly present in this phylum.A putative pstSCAB (MLP_47720, MLP_47730, MLP_47740, and MLP_47750) and three pits (MLP_00530, MLP_29830, and MLP_51060) were identified in the M. phosphovorus genome. Notably, the number of pit genes in M. phosphovorus was among the largest known in an actinobacterial species (Table 1). Based on the molecular phylogenetic analysis, MLP_29830 and MLP_51060 were most homologous to those in actinobacteria (Fig. 2d). On the other hand, MLP_00530 seemed not to be an actinobacterial gene but rather was similar to proteobacterial genes (Fig. 2d) with a maximum amino acid identity of 48%. This might suggest that MLP_00530 was obtained from another phylum, such as Proteobacteria, although an upstream gene with a putative regulatory function (Pfam: PF01865), which is commonly associated with proteobacterial Pit genes, could not be found in the case of MLP_00530.Thus far, the Pit system has not been much studied in Gram-positive bacteria. Rather, it appears not to be mandatory in the group; pit in Myc. smegmatis was dispensable, with the Pst and Phn systems suggested to compensate for the function of Pit,54 and some actinobacteria do not harbour pit in their genomes (Table 1). The reversible Pi transport mediated by Pit without consuming ATP may be favourable to cope with drastic changes in intracellular Pi concentration due to rapid polyP synthesis and degradation in PAO. The possible importance for PAOs of multiple pit genes is supported by the fact that the genome of ‘Ca. Accumulibacter phosphatis’ harbours four pit homologues, more than other proteobacterial species.To accumulate a large amount of intracellular polyP, polyP must be stably maintained as volutin granules. Although molecular mechanisms of volutin granule formation have not been clarified in detail, polyamines were suggested to play a role in polyP accumulation in Escherichia coli.55 Polyamines mainly consist of putrescine, spermidine, and spermine in eukaryotic cells, whereas spermine is contained in only a few prokaryotic species, including some actinobacteria.56 Polyamines are aliphatic amines that are highly-charged cations under physiological conditions. They are generally recognized as essential for the maintenance of cell growth and macromolecular biosynthesis by interacting with nucleic acids, proteins, and membranes. In addition, Motomura et al.55 demonstrated that intracellular polyP increased after adding spermidine and putrescine to E. coli cells in which polyamine synthesis genes had been disrupted. They further demonstrated in vitro that adding polyamines to volutin granule-containing solutions increased the retention time of the granules and that spermidine was the best polyamine for stabilizing the granules.Polyamines are synthesized from l-arginine or l-ornithine via reactions catalysed by arginine decarboxylase (SpeA) and agmatine ureohydrolase (SpeB) or ornithine decarboxylase (SpeC) (Fig. 3). The synthesized putrescine is then converted to spermidine and spermine in the reactions catalysed by spermidine synthase (SpeE) and spermine synthase, respectively, although spermine synthase has not been found in prokaryotes thus far.56 In the M. phosphovorus genome, putative speA (MLP_07520) and speB (MLP_15750) were identified but did not form a gene cluster. Although speB is conserved among actinobacteria, speA or its homologues are rarely identified in actinobacteria. In addition, similarities of M. phosphovorus speA to non-actinobacterial genes are modest, with amino acid identities less than 33%, obscuring the exact origin of this gene. In contrast, the homologue of speE, which is usually present in actinobacteria, was not identified in the M. phosphovorus genome. Polyamine metabolism and related enzymes.

Shadows indicate enzymes for which putative genes were predicted in the M. phosphovorus genome. Polyamine species that were mainly detected in M. phosphovorus cells57 are indicated by asterisks.Busse and Schumann57 reported that spermidine and spermine were the major polyamines in the cells of M. phosphovorus NM-1T, while only a trace amount of putrescine was found. This result contradicts the prediction from the genomic data, i.e. M. phosphovorus can synthesize only putrescine among the three polyamines, as far as the currently recognized metabolic pathway (Fig. 3) is taken into account. Perhaps spermidine and/or spermine are synthesized via unknown synthases or taken up actively by polyamine transporters. M. phosphovorus harbours eight putative genes whose deduced amino acid sequences contain the amino acid/polyamine transporter I motif (InterPro ID: IPR002293). These transporters may be related to the stabilization of volutin granules, although their substrate specificities could not be clearly assigned.In addition to aerobic polyP accumulation, anaerobic PHA production is a recognized feature of PAOs.3 Recently, Aker et al.17 reported the detection in M. phosphovorus NM-1T cells of two PHA species, polyhydroxybutyrate and polyhydroxyvalerate, by Sudan Black B- and Safranin O-staining and gas chromatography methods. However, the system of PHA production in M. phosphovorus appears to be different from that proposed in proteobacterial PAOs; M. phosphovorus apparently produces PHA under aerobic conditions, whereas proteobacterial PAOs are believed to synthesize PHAs anaerobically. In proteobacterial PAOs, PHA is produced using glycogen/glucose or volatile fatty acids such as acetate as substrates, and the uptake of the acetate is conducted via ActP, a proteobacteria-specific acetate/H+ symporter. Acetate uptake through ActP is hypothesized to be counterbalanced by Pi release via Pit using the proton motive force.58,59 The intermediate acetyl-CoA is then converted to PHAs by acetyl-CoA acetyltransferase (PhaA), acetoacetyl-CoA reductase (PhaB), and PHA-synthase (PhaC) (Fig. 4).60 This model was further supported in a proteobacterial PAO, ‘Ca. Accumulibacter phosphatis’, by metagenomic and metaproteomic analyses.9,11 In contrast, neither actP nor phaABC exists in most actinobacteria, and these genes were not found in the M. phosphovorus genome either. Two independent pathways for PHA synthesis through (A) the PhaABC system, and (B) the ß-oxidation pathway. Enzymes for which putative genes were predicted in the M. phosphovorus genome are shadowed.Two independent pathways for PHA synthesis through (A) the PhaABC system, and (B) the ß-oxidation pathway. Enzymes for which putative genes were predicted in the M. phosphovorus genome are shadowed.In addition to the Pha system, other pathways derived from the ß-oxidation pathway proposed in E. coli and Pseudomonas putida could synthesize PHA (Fig. 4).61–63 In E. coli, the gene cluster yfcYX is related to the pathway; the encoded YfcX was demonstrated to be a multifunctional protein with enoyl-CoA hydratase, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase, and putative 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA epimerase activities, and YfcY to be a ß-ketothiolase. In P. putida, (R)-specific enoyl-CoA hydrolase (PhaJ) is involved in the system. Both YfcX and PhaJ result in the synthesis of (R)-3-hydroxyacyl-CoA, the monomer unit of PHAs. In the M. phosphovorus genome, homologues of yfcYX (MLP_23080 and MLP_23090) and phaJ (MLP_12780) were identified, suggesting that these genes might produce PHA in M. phosphovorus rather than the PhaABC system proposed in proteobacterial PAOs. There remains an unresolved issue; both pathways require PhaC for the final polymerization reaction, but the gene is not present in the M. phosphovorus genome. Novel unidentified PHA synthase(s) might exist in M. phosphovorus that enable it to synthesize PHAs via a pathway independent of polyP degradation and distinct from that conventionally proposed in proteobacterial PAOs.Based on the genome analysis as described in this report and previous experimental observations, possible pathways of M. phosphovorus that may represent the features of an actinobacterial PAO were summarized in Fig. 5 (upper panels) together with a model proposed in proteobacterial species (lower panels).4,9,11 Under aerobic conditions, M. phosphovorus takes up Pi through a PstSCAB and multiple Pits. PhnCDE rarely exists in non-proteobacteria and is absent in M. phosphovorus. For Pi uptake via Pits, a proton motive force is required. In ‘Ca. Accumulibacter phosphatis’, the electron transport chain of aerobic respiration was proposed for that function11 and may be the primary source of the proton motive force in aerobic M. phosphovorus, as well. The ingested intracellular Pi is then polymerized into polyP by some of the multiple PPK(s) and stored as volutin granules. In M. phosphovorus, PHA may be synthesized through the ß-oxidation pathway, whereas proteobacteria degrade PHA and utilize it as an energy source under the aerobic conditions.

The upper panels in each figure represent models proposed in this study for M. phosphovorus, while the lower ones represent models recognized in proteobacterial species. Not all intermediate reactions are shown in detail.Under anaerobic conditions, polyP is degraded by other PPK(s), a PPX2 and two PPGKs. Glucose-6-phosphate generated by PPGKs is possibly fed into glycolysis followed by acetate fermentation, and the NADH produced in the process can be used for nitrate respiration and nitrogen assimilation. Because PPGK has been identified only in actinobacteria thus far, this glycolytic pathway coupled with polyP consumption would be unique within this phylum. The release of Pi through Pit symporters generates a proton motive force. While the proton motive force is thought to be used for acetate uptake via ActP in proteobacterial PAOs, this model cannot be applied to non-proteobacteria, because ActP is present almost exclusively in proteobacteria. Instead, the proton motive force may be used, at least in part, for the symport of nitrate by NarK-type transporters in M. phosphovorus.The mechanism of anaerobic polyP utilization in M. phosphovorus thus appears to be substantially different from that in proteobacterial PAOs, in contrast to the general similarities seen in aerobic polyP accumulation. In proteobacteria, the polyP degradation system is thought to be tightly linked to acetate uptake and the synthesis of PHA as an energy reservoir. The system in M. phosphovorus, however, does not appear to be directly linked to the synthesis of PHA, but may couple with the carbon and energy metabolism necessary for a minimal level of growth under anaerobic conditions. This might be another reason why M. phosphovorus can accumulate much larger amounts of polyP under the alternating aerobic/anaerobic conditions in the EBPR process.3.3. Future perspectivesIn the present study, we found genetic features in the M. phosphovorus genome that could allow it to express phenotypic characteristics of a PAO. Some of these features, such as the high multiplicity of ppk and pit genes, were commonly seen in the genome of a proteobacterial PAO candidate, ‘Ca. Accumulibacter phosphatis’, supporting the importance of these genes for polyP metabolisms. On the other hand, some other features, such as the presence of duplicated ppgk genes and the unique absence of one type of ppx gene, were specific to the M. phosphovorus genome. Yet to be elucidated, however, is whether other factors, such as expression levels and activities of these gene products or their differential regulation, would also affect the PAO phenotype.Genes possibly related to polyP accumulation were widely dispersed across the genome of M. phosphovorus, and molecular phylogenetic analyses suggested that some had exogenous origins. This tendency was also seen in the ‘Ca. Accumulibacter phosphatis’ genome (data not shown). In support of the high plasticity of M. phosphovorus genome, the number of genes whose predicted protein product had at least one Pfam domain related to transposase, integrase, or recombinase was highest in M. phosphovorus (99 genes) among the actinobacterial species listed in Table 1. From the aspect of genome evolution, a possible ancestral genetic locus for phosphate metabolism can be seen in the genome of Gemmatimonas aurantiaca (DOGAN database: http://www.bio.nite.go.jp/dogan/project/view/GA1, accession number in INSD: AP009153) which was also isolated from an EBPR-activated sludge.64 In this organism, all predicted genes related to phosphate metabolism (a pstSCAB, a ppx, a ppk, a pit, and five regulator genes) occur as a single gene cluster. Provided that the gene cluster represents an ancestral trait, PAOs may have evolved convergently in a variety of taxa via complex recombinational events including duplication, deletion, and horizontal gene transfer that occurred independently in each lineage.Recently, five species in the genus Microlunatus have newly been isolated; none accumulates polyP.29–31,65,66 Genome data for these related species and comparative genomics approaches would provide a clearer picture of the genetic background characteristic of PAOs.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry of Japan.The authors thank Drs Tomohiko Tamura, Misa Otoguro and Ken-ichiro Suzuki for their useful discussions and the help in cell culture.Supplementary data"

IntroductionIn order to better stratify cancer patients for the best treatment or no treatment (active surveillance), characterization of the tumour will be required that can define the molecular changes associated with indolent or aggressive behaviour. A large effort in cancer research is aimed at identifying these cancer biomarkers that will augment the prognostic value of contemporary clinical and pathological features in stratifying risk of progression. Single-nucleotide variations (SNVs) affecting the gene expression of key regulatory genes provide both mechanism and markers for the progression of cancer. However, the vast numbers of genes affected by SNVs and the unknown impact of specific mutations on protein expression and function make the derivation of driver and passenger mutations difficult. Larger genomic rearrangements, such as amplifications, deletions and translocations, predict more distinct impacts on gene expression. The recent evaluation of the prevalence and reoccurrence of large genomic rearrangements and translocations in solid tumours has highlighted their value in defining cancer progression and prognosis.1 Significantly, clinical tests aimed at recurrent translocations/gene fusions involving Bcl-Abl, TMPRSS2-ERG, c-myc and bcl2 already impact clinical decisions.1–4Massively parallel, next-generation DNA sequencing technologies represent a quantum advance in the ability to understand cancer at the genetic level. However, in order to accurately characterize genomic aberrations that define a tumour population, it is critical to obtain pure genetic material from the tumour with no or minimal contamination of surrounding cells. Tumours exist as outgrowths or repopulations of normal tissues with genetically modified cells, and as a result, malignant cells are often embedded and intermixed with normal cells making the sampling of pure tumour cells difficult. Specifically, the bulk sampling of a tumour mass is inevitably contaminated with varying degrees of non-neoplastic stromal, inflammatory, and epithelial cells, which complicate the genetic interrogation of the tumour cells. Laser capture microdissection (LCM) is a powerful tool to efficiently and accurately extract pure populations of tumour cells from clinical specimens, yet provides a limited number of cells and genetic material for analysis. The mate pair (MP) next-generation sequencing (NGS) protocol developed for the evaluation is capable of evaluating large genomic rearrangements using only a single lane of the Illumina GAIIx sequencer.5,6 However, this protocol currently requires DNA quantities far greater than those that can be yielded from LCM extracted tissues (5–10 µg), making the application of LCM to this NGS platform challenging.5In this study, we report a novel methodology that enables the efficient and reproducible whole-genome amplification (WGA) of DNA from small LCM collected clinical specimens for application in the MP NGS protocol. We demonstrate the use of this technique in evaluating two pathologically distinct adjacent tumour grades (Gleason patterns) in a patient with prostate cancer.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Tissue selection and LCMH&E stained sections of prostate cancer tissues were reviewed by a urologic pathologist (J.C.C.) and graded for tumour content. Frozen prostate tissue sections were cut into 10 µm size and stained with Cresyl Violet (LCM Staining Kit, Ambion; AM1935). GP3 and GP4 tumour regions were separately excised by LCM using the Arcturus PixCell II microscope and CapSure Macro LCM caps (Arcturus; LCM 0211). LCM of adjacent histologically normal (aN) peripheral zone prostatic epithelial cells (in the same tissue section as GP3 and GP4) and distal normal (dN) peripheral zone prostatic epithelial cells (separate benign tissue block from the opposite side of the prostate gland from cancer) were used as controls.2.2. Direct in situ DNA extraction and amplificationLCM cap polymer regions containing engrafted cells were carefully excised and applied directly to WGA using a modified Repli-g protocol as follows (Qiagen, CA, USA). A modified Repli-g D2 buffer was first prepared (2.5 µl phosphate buffered saline, 3 µl Repli-g buffer (DLB) and 1 µl ditiothreitol per sample) and 6.5 µl was added to the LCM engrafted cells in 0.2 µl capped tubes ensuring complete immersion of the polymer fragments. Samples were incubated for 10 min on ice. Reactions were subsequently neutralized upon addition of 3.5 µl of Repli-g stop solution, prior to adding 40 µl of the standard Repli-g mini kit master mix and incubating for 16 h at 30°C. Final heating to 65°C for 3 min inactivated the DNA polymerase. WGA was performed on at least four independent reactions from parallel frozen sections and equal volumes pooled to minimize the amplification bias. For smaller lesions excised LCM regions from multiple sections can be applied to a single WGA reaction. WGA DNA (1 µl) was visualized on 1% agarose gels and quantitated using the Quant-iT PicoGreen dsDNA reagent (Invitrogen, P7581). Qualitative multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was performed according to the Sigma-Aldrich protocol and PCR products resolved on 4% agarose gels (Sigma-Aldrich; P0982).2.3. Illumina MP Library ProductionA modified Illumina MP library protocol was used. Briefly 10 µg of WGA DNA was fragmented to 3–5 kb using the Covaris E210 (Duty Cycle 20%, Intensity 1, 1000 cycles burst for 600 s.). End repair was extended to 30 min prior to the biotin end-labelling step and size selection on a 1% agarose gel. The biotin-labelled blunt-end fragments were then circularized and endonuclease treated, before the remaining DNA circles were fragmented again to 350–650 bp on the Covaris E210. The biotinylated terminal fragments were then immobilized on M-280 streptavidin beads (Dynal) and assembled into conventional Illumina adapter flanked paired-end (PE) libraries. Libraries were amplified (18 cycles) using conventional Illumina PCR adapter primer pairs (PE 1.0 and PE 2.0), purified and analyzed on an Agilent Bioanalyzer DNA 1000 chip. The library was loaded onto one lane of an Illumina flow cell at a concentration of 9 pM generating an average of 215 000 clusters/tile using the Illumina cluster station and PE cluster kit v4. The flow cell was sequenced as a 76 × 2 PE read on an Illumina GAIIx using SBS sequencing kit v4 and SCS v2.5. Base calling was performed using Illumina Pipeline v1.5.2.4. Bioinformatics protocolsBioinformatics protocols to rapidly and efficiently process NGS MP data using a 32-bit binary indexing of the Hg19 reference genome, to which consecutive 32-bit binary sequences from associated MP reads are aligned, have been previously published from our laboratory.6 This algorithm has subsequently been further optimized and is presented in depth in a separate manuscript.7 The algorithm maps both MP reads successively in the whole genome, thus minimizes miss mapping and reduces false positives. The algorithm aggressively tries to find mapping possibilities where the two reads map <15 kb apart allowing up to 10 mismatches. If mapping gave multiple good possibilities then the one with the lowest cumulative mismatch count was sent to the output. MPs mapping >15 kb apart or in different chromosomes were defined as large genomic rearrangements and selected for further analysis. When two reads map to the same chromosome more than 20 kb apart, they are defined as intra-chromosomal rearrangement (r) events. When they map to different chromosomes, they are defined as inter-chromosomal translocation (t) events. Filters, based on homology scores calculated during mapping, are applied to eliminate false positives. Fragments that represent the same event are identified as associate fragments and are clustered together. A mask table was created to further eliminate false-positive events that pass these filters defined from recurrent events in normal tissues or through BLAST-like alignment tool mapping of multiple aligning regions. After the removal of replicate read pairs, coverage calculations indicated the expected number of MPs covering a breakpoint. Replication was calculated for each chromosome and the replicate read pairs were removed. Bridged coverage was calculated as the sum of the fragment lengths (distance between read 1 and read 2) of correctly mapping MP and PE reads, divided by the mappable chromosome size. Base coverage was calculated from the total number of mappable reads, multiplied by the read length and divided by the mappable chromosome size. The coverage was calculated per chromosome and the average was found using chromosomes 1–22. For allelic coverage, the values must be divided by 2. A procedure generated count plots of the number of mapped read pairs in non-overlapping equal-length windows. The algorithm normalized each sample by calculating the window size such that windows in parts of the genome without deletions or amplifications contained an average of 300 mapped read pairs.2.5. Validation of genomic rearrangementsMP sequence reads were mapped to the human genome, and primers spanning the fusion junctions were used in validation PCRs (50 µl, 35 cycles), on WGA tumour or normal DNA with human genomic DNA (gDNA) used as a control (G304A; Promega, WI, USA). Unique PCR products yielded from the WGA DNA, absent from control, were isolated by gel extraction (Minelute; Qiagen 28004) and Sanger sequenced. For secondary validation of genomic rearrangements on unamplified GP3 and GP4 DNA extracts, LCM was performed on fresh tissue sections and extracted by Arcturus Pico Pure DNA extraction reagents (20 µl/lesion) after incubation at 65°C for 4 h. PCRs (25 µl) were run in parallel to WGA G3/G4 DNA (100 ng, 35 cycles) but using 5 µl of unamplified material (40 cycles).3. Results3.1. Isolation of prostate GP3 and GP4 DNAA prostate cancer case containing two regions of adjacent but distinct GP3 and GP4 tumours (Fig. 1a, central panel) was selected for the study. For the GP3 tumour (Fig. 1a, left panel), the infiltrative glands are well formed, each with a discernible round to oval shape. The GP4 tumour (Fig. 1a, right panel) shows a loss of distinct glandular differentiation in comparison with GP3, and cells are arranged in cribriform structures as well as sheets of tumour cells. LCM was used to isolate cells specific to the GP3 and GP4 populations minimizing the contamination of adjacent cells. Figure 1b demonstrates the power of the LCM technique, showing the section images before and after the laser-mediated extraction, as well as the cellular population of the GP3 and GP4 isolated on the LCM caps.

Controls utilized gDNA (10 ng) in the WGA reaction or unamplified gDNA (unA) in the multiplex PCR.To obtain enough gDNA to enable high-throughput MP sequencing of the specific GP of prostate cancer, WGA of the isolated DNA was required. Conventional techniques of DNA extraction and purification prior to WGA resulted in considerable variation and bias in the output quality of the DNA in pilot studies (data not shown). In order to improve on the quality of the sequencing data, a modified direct in situ WGA protocol was developed. This novel technique involved the application of engrafted LCM cellular material directly into WGA reactions. The chemical conditions of an initial DNA denaturing step facilitated the lysis of the engrafted LCM cells and the release of the nuclear reservoir of gDNA to the subsequent WGA reaction. Significantly, the crude cellular lysate did not result in observable inhibition of the enzymatic amplification reaction, generating DNA yields equivalent to control-purified gDNA (Fig. 1c). The reproducibility of this direct in situ WGA method is exemplified in parallel reactions on two sets of six consecutive LCM isolations of prostate tissue frozen sections (Fig. 1c, upper panel) yielding WGA DNA products of similar quantity and size on an agarose gel. Yields of amplified gDNA were typically in the range of 8–10 µg/50 µl WGA reactions. A multiplex PCR was used to assess amplification bias and quality of the WGA DNA. The banding patterns of five amplicons (132–295 bp) for the WGA DNA samples were equivalent to control WGA and unamplified DNA (Fig. 1c, lower panel). This result gave an initial positive indication of the representative genomic amplification in these WGA reactions. The reproducible amplification quality and quantity of WGA DNA yielded directly from LCM of 12 different prostate cases and 4 lung tissues are also presented in Fig. 1d.3.2. MP sequencing and bioinformatics mapping algorithmMP libraries were assembled for the prostate GP3 and GP4 WGA DNA samples using the modified MP library assembly protocol described. The conventional Illumina protocols were adapted to account for the different physical properties of the WGA DNA. The MP libraries were sequenced on single lanes of the Illumina GAIIx platform. MP sequencing of the GP3 and GP4 cancers generated 33.0 and 29.4 million mappable read pairs, respectively, consistent with results from our MP sequencing of conventional unamplified gDNA on the GAIIx sequencer, which yielded averages of 27.1 million reads. A set of algorithms was developed to detect large chromosomal aberrations with low false-positive rates. The algorithms were specifically designed to handle NGS from mate-pair protocols.7 The algorithms describe coverage in two ways: conventional base-pair coverage from the 75–100-bp reads and the theoretical bridged-coverage considering the original 3–5-kb span separating two MP reads (Fig. 2a). MP reads mapping with the expected region span allows us to infer that the correct sequence span lies between the reads. Fragment mapping profiles are presented in Fig. 2b. The predominant fragment population reflects the MP reads with 3–5 kb bridged spans. The second narrower peaks at around -300 bp consist of co-purifying PE library fragments derived from internal fragments of the circles not spanning the ligation junctions (Fig. 2a). The PE peaks map algorithmically with negative values due to the different polarity of the read pairs stemming from the circularization in the MP methodology.5 The fragment mapping profile for unamplified (Fig. 2b, i) and WGA (Fig. 2b, ii) DNA are effectively equivalent, with the WGA DNA mapping with just slightly reduced span of 2.5–5 kb indicative of the starting input of the smaller DNA fragments (Fig. 1c). Although the proportion of PE mapping fragments is still higher with the WGA DNA, additional refinements of the MP protocol could reduce this further. MP NGS of WGA DNA products.

The average bridged coverage's of 18 and 21X were obtained for the GP3 and GP4 tumours, respectively, compared with an average of 17.5X for our unamplified DNA. The average sequence base coverages of 1–2X were observed for both DNA inputs. Base-pair and bridged coverages are presented for each chromosome in Fig. 2c. Both measures of coverage are observed to be relatively consistent across the majority of chromosomes for both the unamplified and WGA samples. The level of replication indicates how many identical MP sequences are derived from sequencing clusters. This replication of MP sequences is expected due to the PCR amplification processes involved in library assembly and is bioinformatically removed to prevent bias in library mapping. The GP3 and GP4 samples were associated with averages of 6 and 10% replication, respectively, in a range identical to an unamplified DNA sample (Fig. 2d).While this report exemplifies a single prostate cancer case, multiple additional WGA samples have been processed using this methodology on the enhanced Illumina HiSeq platform. Figure 2e illustrates the coverage and replication from the MP sequencing of WGA DNA samples yielded from 22 additional prostate tissues. The average total number of reads increased to 76.7 million on the newer HiSeq platform, with the resultant base and bridged coverage levels averaging 3 and 39X, respectively. As expected, the mean levels of replication also increased to 37X, potentially due to sequence saturation on the flow cell. Together, these data provide us with further confidence in the reproducibility of the amplification methodology and the mapping algorithm described in this study.Figure 2f (i and ii, respectively) shows MP count plots associated with an unamplified DNA sample on chromosomes 4 and 10. Although both chromosomes show very flat even profiles (Fig. 2f, i), chromosome 10 shows a clear drop in frequency between 98 and 112 Mb (Fig. 2f, ii), indicative of a deletion in this region. The centromeres are observed as sequence gaps due to the current lack of reference sequence for these regions due to the high levels of repetition. The equivalent WGA GP4 tumour frequency plots are shown in Fig. 2f, iii and iv. Although coverages across the chromosomes are high, the frequency profiles are much more variable than the unamplified DNA. Thus, at the fine mapping level, the amplification process results in some level of differential amplification bias across the genome. This variability in the frequency profiles does unfortunately make it difficult to confidently call copy number variations. Nevertheless, these data demonstrate that the MP sequencing from WGA DNA does result in extensive genome coverage across chromosomes.3.3. Large genetic aberrations in the GP3 and GP4 cell populationsTable 1 lists the large genomic aberrations detected in the GP3 and GP4 of this prostate cancer by our MP sequencing. The events recorded passed bioinformatics filters in the mapping algorithm detailed in Materials and methods. Initial MP mapping predicted many more events prior to filtering, but the majority were false positives due to miss-mapping from highly repetitive or currently undefined regions within the reference human genome. The table is split into potential inter-chromosomal translocations and intra-chromosomal rearrangements (amplifications, deletions or inversions). The first significant observation is that the majority of large genomic aberrations are present in both the GP3 and GP4 cell populations of this prostate cancer, presenting strong evidence of common origin or clonality between these two Gleason patterns. However, the numbers of associated MPs varies considerably, both between the same and different chromosomal events. PCR was used to validate events in Table 1 assessing the accuracy of the algorithm used to call genomic rearrangements from WGA DNA. Large genomic rearrangements in the GP3 and GP4 cancersLarge genomic rearrangements in the GP3 and GP4 cancers3.4. Validation of a chromosome 1–12 balanced translocation eventFigure 3a–c presents the validation of a balanced translocation event between 1q32.3c and 12q21.33a, involving genes VASH2 and AK055062, respectively (Table 1). The GP3 and GP4 cell populations recorded 11 and 21 MP reads, respectively (Table 1), which are mapped in Fig. 3a. The upper and lower parts of the figures refer to chromosomes 1 and 12, respectively. MP reads are illustrated as either blue or red dots, depending on the polarity of the MP sequence mapping to the reference genome, with a line linking the paired reads. Central horizontally linked red-to-blue dots represent intra-chromosomal mapping MP fragments with the concordant bridged coverage spans (3–5 kb). Vertically linked red-to-blue dots are associated with MPs specific to this translocation event between chromosomes 1 and 12 (Fig. 3a, i and ii). Two sets of red/blue-linked MP events spanning the two chromosomes are observed, red-to-blue and blue-to-red. This is indicative of a balanced translocation event between the two chromosomes, where genomic regions have been exchanged between the two chromosomes resulting in t(1-12) and t(12-1) translocation products (Fig. 3c). The regions where the red–blue and blue–red mapping events converge indicate the location of the translocation breakpoints. Validation of chromosome translocation events: mapping of two independent translocation events are depicted; a balanced translocation between chromosomes 1 and 12 (a–c) and a complex rearrangement between chromosomes 8 and 11 (e and f). (a) MP sequences mapping to chromosomes 1 and 12 for GP3 and GP4 are depicted above and below the zero axis, respectively, as red or blue dots dependent on the direction of the sequence read mapping to the reference genome. Horizontally linked red and blue dots closest to this axis depict normal mapping MP sequences to chromosome 1 or 12 alone. MP sequences linked vertically depict translocations between these two chromosomes.

(f) Schematic representation of the three fusion events on chromosome 8 (red) and 11 (blue), describing the potential products and the impact on the gene regions involved. Arrows describe the coding direction of the genes and an X represents the loss of the promoter regions.PCR primers spanning the indicated breakpoints on chromosomes 1 and 12 were used to validate the translocation events (Fig. 3b, i and ii). Specific bands are observed for both the GP3 and GP4 samples (lanes 5, 6, 9 and 10) that are not present in the human gDNA control (lanes 2 and 8) or two additional prostate cancers from different patients (lanes 3 and 4). Sanger sequencing of excised PCR bands yielded unique fusion sites for both the t(1-12) and t(12-1) translocation events. Identical fusion junctions were observed in the GP3 and GP4 samples. The t(1-12) translocation resulted in the fusion [chr1:213 127 018] to [chr12:89 406 958]. The t(12-1) translocation mapped [chr12:89 407 157] to [chr1:213 127 057], but was more complex, involving an additional inversion of 40 nucleotides of chromosome 1 [chr1:213 127 017–213 127 056] with an overlap of four nucleotides (TAAG) at the 12–12 fusion point (Supplementary Table S1). Both fusions are intronic, located between exons 2 and 3 of VASH2 and exons 1 and 2 of AK055062 resulting in two potential fusion proteins (Fig. 3c). The consequence of these two fusion events, the translation products yielded and the impact on tumourigenesis still needs to be investigated and were beyond the scope of this current work.3.5. Validation of chromosome 8–11 complex rearrangementFigure 3d–f describes the mapping and validation of a more complex chromosomal rearrangement, involving two translocations from VPS13B on chromosome 8 to two distal sites on chromosome 11 involving CHKA and CHEK1. The MP mapping of these two events each predict a single junction, without associated balanced events (Fig. 3d, i and ii). While one event predicts a direct translocation between the chromosomes 8 and 11 regions with blue-to-red MPs, the second event is more complex with red-to-red MPs predicting a sequence inversion. In order to understand this complex rearrangement, a third event involving an intra-chromosomal inversion (blue-to-blue MP) of a large segment of the q-arm of chromosome 11 linking SASP2 to CHEK1 needs to be considered (Fig. 3d, iii). Considering the three events together the balanced recombination event can be predicted (Fig. 3f). While the 8-11 translocation between CHKA and VPS13B describes one half of the rearrangement, events 2 and 3 together form the balanced event. Specifically, a large fragment of the q-arm of chromosome 11 inverted, linking the CHKA adjacent gene; SASP3 to CHEK1 at the termini of chromosome 11, with the rest of the CHEK1 gene fusing with VPS13B on chromosome 8. Using primers spanning the predicted fusion sites, each event was validated by PCR generating unique bands in both the GP3 and GP4 cell populations that were not observed with control gDNA (Fig. 3e). While events 1 and 3 would result in the fusion of two gene regions with the loss of promoter sequences, event 2 results in both CHEK1 and VPS13B retaining their promoters and thus two truncated proteins may result with unknown cellular impact. Additionally, a ~300 kb fragment spanning from CHKA to SAPS3 is unaccounted for in this description. However, the reduced coverage of MPs adjacent to the CHKA and SASP3 MP regions in Fig. 3d could indicate a deletion of these sequences.3.6. Additional validations in the GP3 and GP4 cancersIn order to further support this novel experimental methodology and bioinformatics algorithm, 12 additional events from Table 1 were selected for PCR validation. All 12 events generated unique PCR products in the prostate cancer that were absent in control gDNA (Fig. 4a). Significantly, all events but one validated in both the GP3 and GP4 samples; however, the intensity of the bands often varied between GP3 and GP4, indicating this did not result from LCM contamination. For several events, the intensity of the band was greater in the GP4 than the GP3, indicating a greater prevalence of the rearrangement in the GP4 cell population. Only the event t(2-23) validated predominantly in GP3 with no or potential very low levels observed in the GP4 (Fig. 4a–c). While it is difficult to confidently define the levels of each genomic aberration in these tumours considering the input of WGA DNA and the semi-quantitative PCR, the band intensities correlated to some extent with the numbers of associated MP reads (Table 1). Sanger sequencing of the validating PCR bands revealed the fusion breakpoints for each event (Supplementary Table S1). Significantly, for each PCR band, the exact fusion junction was identified in both the GP3 and GP4 samples. These data present strong evidence for the clonality of GP3 and GP4 in this prostate cancer. Additionally, the presence of the exact junction breakpoints in both GP3 and GP4 makes these fusion events unlikely to be artefacts of WGA. Additional validations in the GP3 and GP4 cancers: (a) 1% agarose gels of PCR validation for 12 additional chromosomal rearrangement events in the GP3 and GP4 cancers, involving two primer sets and using gDNA as control. (b) PCR evaluation of aN and dN tissues for 17 previously validated events in GP3 and GP4 tumours of the same patient. (c) PCR validation in amplified (WGA) and unamplified (nonWGA) GP3 and GP4 tissues for four validated events.Additional validations in the GP3 and GP4 cancers: (a) 1% agarose gels of PCR validation for 12 additional chromosomal rearrangement events in the GP3 and GP4 cancers, involving two primer sets and using gDNA as control. (b) PCR evaluation of aN and dN tissues for 17 previously validated events in GP3 and GP4 tumours of the same patient. (c) PCR validation in amplified (WGA) and unamplified (nonWGA) GP3 and GP4 tissues for four validated events.3.7. Evaluation of genomic rearrangements in histologically normal adjacent tissuesAdjacent peripheral gland normal (aN) from the same sections as the GP3 and GP4 cancers was isolated by LCM and WGA. Additional, distal peripheral normal (dN) from the opposite side of the patient's prostate and in a different frozen tissue block was similarly isolated. Fusion-specific PCRs evaluated 16 validated events in the aN and dN samples. Surprisingly, the majority of events were present in aN, although the intensity of the bands were consistently reduced (Fig. 4b). All the events associated with the previously discussed 1–12 and 8–11 rearrangements validated in the aN tissue, as did a group of five rearrangements within a 50-Mb region of chromosome 4, suggesting potential early events in cancer progression. Just r(2-2)a, r(2-2)b and r(6-6) yielded no equivalent bands in aN. Sanger sequencing of 12 aN bands of sufficient intensity to sequence without further amplification, confirmed the events (data not shown). The absence of any of these events in the dN, while predicting a potential local field effect phenomenon for this patient, also further eliminated the possibility of WGA artefacts. Although LCM contamination cannot be excluded in these analyses, the range of different banding patterns observed between the GP3, GP4 and aN tissues, specifically the contrasting t(2-23) GP3-specific event, minimizes these concerns.3.8. Validation in non-amplified tissuesTo further confirm that these rearrangements were not artefacts of the WGA process, additional validations on unamplified tissues were performed. Further LCM of the same GP3 and GP4 cell populations was performed and DNA extracted in small volumes of extraction buffer. Due to the limited quantities of DNA extracted, only a limited number of previously optimized validation PCRs could be performed. Figure 4c demonstrates that identical bands were reproduced in the unamplified tissues as were observed in the WGA samples, further indicating the reliability of the methodology.4. DiscussionHigh-throughput NGS provides a powerful tool to investigate the molecular changes associated with cancer progression. To confidently identify these changes, it is vital to have methodologies to determine genetic changes specific to tumour populations. Prostate cancer like many cancers is heterogeneous with various degrees of differentiation that are assessed in the Gleason scoring system.8 A critical transition for patient prognosis and for dictating therapy is the presence of GP4 or higher.9 Men who have tumours composed entirely of GP3 have an excellent outcome regardless of treatment.10 In contrast, the presence of GP4 in addition to GP3 has a significant negative impact on survival and raises the possibility that GP3 alone is molecularly different from GP3 associated with GP4. Therefore, to understand prostate cancer progression, stratify patients by risk of progression and to provide an optimal care, it is necessary to understand the molecular changes in GP3 and GP4, and those that drive progression to GP4. The methodology described enables the accurate collection of pure populations of clinical specimens and the subsequent direct WGA of the gDNA.The reporting of the prevalence and major role of the E-twenty six (ETS)/TMPRSS2 family of genomic rearrangements in prostate cancer has dramatically changed the perception of solid tumour biology.1 Elucidation of genomic rearrangements present in solid tumours provides a scaffold to study disease heterogeneity, as well as the relationships between distinct cell populations such as clonality and cancer progression. The NGS MP protocol provides a method to specifically interrogate a gDNA sample for large rearrangements and was thus modified for the input WGA DNA.5 The application of this methodology to WGA DNA yielded MP sequencing of similar quality to unamplified gDNA. Specifically, MP sequencing coverage and replication levels for WGA DNA were equivalent to unamplified DNA. However, frequency plots did indicate more focal variation in the WGA MP profiles compared with unamplified DNA, indicating some bias in the regional amplification, which made copy number variation calling problematic with WGA DNA. We are currently investigating complex bioinformatics algorithms aimed at compensating for this natural frequency variation from WGA profiles to enable more confident copy variation number calling. It must also be noted that the prostate cancer case exemplified in this study was performed on the Illumina GAIIx platform and more recent sequencing of WGA MP libraries using the methodology described in this report on the newer Illumina HiSeq platform generated far greater depths of sequencing (Fig. 2f and Supplemental Table S2).In this study, LCM was used to collect pure populations of GP3 and GP4 tumour cells, together with benign-appearing prostatic cells from the same patient. Our novel methodology for WGA and MP sequencing enabled us to accurately define large genomic aberrations using algorithms developed in our laboratory. Table 1 lists 30 high-confidence genomic rearrangements within the GP3 and GP4 tumour cell populations. The 30 events involved 15 chromosomes, with 20 intra-chromosomal rearrangements and 10 inter-chromosomal translocations. Each event selected for validation was successfully verified by PCR and the fusion junctions determined, emphasizing the validity of the technique and algorithm presented in this study. While many genomic rearrangements were predicted, conservative filtering and knowledge of recurrent false positives additionally observed in normal tissues enabled us to eliminate the majority of false positives. Significantly, the GP3 and GP4 of this patient did not contain the common ERG-TMPRSS2 fusion event,1 but the validated t(7-17) fusion site lies just 15 kb downstream of the ETS family member; ETV1 gene, which is fused at a similar 3' distance downstream of the previously unreported ETS family fusion partner ALOX12B. Though no fusion product is predicted, this case was independently demonstrated to have elevated ETV1 expression (data not shown).The presence of identical rearrangements within the adjacent Gleason patterns provides evidence of the common origin of GP3 and GP4 in this prostate cancer, indicating the clonal expansion of GP3 with progression to GP4, a critical step in disease progression with very important clinical implications. While we cannot extrapolate this single patient observation to prostate cancer in general, this report describes powerful methodology to address this question in multiple prostate tumour samples, which is currently underway in our laboratory. Additionally, while these data may provide clues to potential GP3 to GP4 progression in the ratio of MP numbers and the intensity of PCR validation bands, care must be taken considering the input of WGA amplified DNA in the studies. More extensive and direct experimentation is required on unamplified tissues to answer these questions, which was outside the scope of this study. Our findings also suggest the presence of a significant prostate cancer field effect in this patient with 13 of 16 validated events, also present in the aN tissues but not dN prostate samples (Fig. 4b). While great care was taken in the LCM sampling, contamination cannot be ruled out. However, the varying levels of PCR banding observed for the GP3, GP4 and aN validations (Fig. 4a and b) does not reflect a level of continuity expected from a constant level of contamination in each sample.The main difference of our procedure from previous studies relates to handling and amplification of DNA from small numbers of captured cells. To circumvent limitations related to low DNA yields and quality resulting from LCM of a few hundred cells, we developed an in situ whole-genome DNA amplification procedure to bypass the DNA extraction steps. As described, this methodology produced a good quality DNA resulting in representative MP sequencing data spanning the whole genome of tumour cells. While MP sequencing of WGA DNA did result in significant increases in uneven profiles across the genome, it still provided adequate depth of sequencing to reveal a large set of rearrangements that were validated by independent experimental methods. We conclude that the ability to genetically characterize pure populations of histologically significant lesions far outweighs these limitations introduced by WGA of the DNA.While the successful application of WGA to the MP protocol was demonstrated in this report, special attention must be made in both library assembly and bioinformatics analysis. The reduced size of the input WGA (~15 kb) compared with unamplified DNA (~50 kb) required specific modifications to the Illumina MP fragmentation protocols. Over fragmentation of WGA DNA using protocols designed for normal gDNA was observed to compromise the final sequencing data, resulting in reduced MP data coverage. While the bioinformatics algorithm applied to WGA and gDNA was identical, WGA DNA was observed to result in increased background noise in the MP data. A summary of MP data from eight cases each of WGA and unamplified gDNA are presented in Supplementary Table S2. Large numbers of false-positive discordant MP reads were clearly a factor for both DNA inputs due to limitations in the Illumina MP library production protocols. The percentage of discordant MPs that passed initial filters, were as expected slightly greater with WGA DNA. This elevated false-positive fusion frequency potentially arises from artefacts of random re-priming of the 3' termini of displaced amplification fragments to non-specific sites. While significant in the output MP data, they predominantly present as single events with no associates and the majority are removed in the final filtering steps requiring three associated MP reads to pass filter. An indication of the false positive rates can thus be reflected in the number of observed MPs that present with no associates. As expected, this population is extensive for both groups, with 83% of discordant MP having no associates for the gDNA before initial filtering. This figure was almost 10% higher with WGA DNA (91%) reflecting a larger proportion of false positives stemming from the amplification protocol. However, upon filtering the number of unique discordant MPs from the two populations is similar, reflective of the effectiveness of the bioinformatics algorithms applied to eliminate these false positives. In conclusion, while an increased number of false positives are predicted with WGA, the presence of these events as unique random events enables them to be easily eliminated upon bioinformatics filtering. However, care must always be taken in interpreting potential fusion events in MP data and PCR validation is generally required to truly validate events. Nevertheless, the robustness of the algorithm is emphasized in the level of validation observed in this study. Conversely, a significant number of genomic breakpoints may be missed due to reduced depths of sequencing or underrepresentation in the final library preparations. However, defining the level of false-negative calls in the data is far more complex and would require absolute knowledge of all the translocations present in a case to be assessed.The Illumina MP protocol enables the sequencing of 100 nucleotides from the termini of larger spanning (2–5 kb) DNA fragments compared with conventional PE libraries (0.2–0.5 kb). This extended DNA span increases the probability of spanning a genomic breakpoint. The ‘bridged-coverage’ of >30X with a half lane of a HiSeq2000 data is highly effective at detecting these breakpoints. However, with ‘base-coverage’ in the range of 4–5X, the ability to call SNVs is limited. The reduced size of DNA yielded from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE) tissues (generally <500 bp) also precludes its application to the MP protocol and most WGA techniques. Interrogation of large genomic rearrangements in DNA from FFPE tissues currently requires whole genome sequencing of PE libraries on several lanes of an Illumina HiSeq2000 flow cell in order to attain high enough sequencing depths to confidently call fusion breakpoints. While more robust methods are now available for WGA from FFPE tissues, these methodologies target the smaller species of DNA present in these tissues, generally <500 bp which still precludes their application to current MP protocols.In summary, this study shows the methodology of interrogating small pure cell populations by NGS technologies using LCM coupled with WGA and a modified MP library assembly protocol. The WGA DNA generated in this study is of sufficient quality and quantity for application to other next generation protocols, including whole-genome and exome capture sequencing protocols (data not shown and S.J. Murphy et al., submitted). Sampling and sequencing of distinct tumour cell populations as well as histologically normal cell populations allows the characterization of genetic changes occurring between these cell populations providing insight into cancer development and progression. The results described for the prostate tissue exemplified in this study provide major clues to the origin of this patient's cancer. Current experimentation in our laboratory is using this methodology to sequence large panels of adjacent tumours and histologically normal tissues from a variety of cancer types to identify large genomic translocations suitable for clinical targeting.ContributionsS.J.M., J.C.C., F.K., R.J.K. and G.V. planned the project, S.J.M., J.C.C., S.Z., R.A.S. and B.W.E. carried out the experiments.

IntroductionThe luminal surface of the intestine limits the access of pathogenic microorganisms to the underlying host tissues and is protected by a single layer of epithelial cells bound by tight-junctions. Located within the follicle-associated epithelia (FAE) overlying the organized mucosal lymphoid aggregates including Peyer's patches, colonic patches, isolated lymphoid follicles, the nasal-associated lymphoid tissues (NALTs) and occasionally within villous epithelia are microfold cells (M cells). This unique subset of epithelial cells is characterized by an irregular brush border, a reduced glycocalyx and lysosomes and is specialized for the transcytosis of macromolecules and particulate antigens.1,2 Following their uptake and transcytosis by M cells, antigens exit into the intraepithelial pocket on the basolateral membrane where they are subsequently processed by macrophages and classical dendritic cells (DCs). As a consequence, the FAE and the M cells within it enable the host's immune system to efficiently sample the intestinal lumen and mount an appropriate immune response.Although the FAE as an important site of mucosal antigen sampling, little is known about the genes which influence the development and function of the cells within it. The tumour necrosis factor (TNF) superfamily member receptor activator of nuclear factor (NF)-<U+03BA>B ligand (RANKL) is selectively expressed by subepithelial stromal cells beneath the FAE in Peyer's patches.1 RANKL signals via its receptor RANK which is expressed by epithelial cells throughout the intestine. The production of RANKL by the subepithelial stromal cells beneath the FAE has been shown to be a critical factor that stimulates the differentiation of RANK-expressing enterocytes into M cells.1 Furthermore, M cells are depleted in vivo by RANKL neutralization and are absent in RANKL-deficient mice. Stimulation from other TNF superfamily member ligands via TNF receptor and lymphotoxin ß receptor,3 and factors produced by pathogenic bacteria such as cholera toxin (CT)4 have also been shown to influence gene expression in the FAE. Recent data also show that Spi-B is an important transcription factor that acts downstream of RANKL–RANK signalling to control the terminal differentiation of mature M cells.5,6Our previous meta-analyses of diverse ranges of primary cells and cell lines7 using the novel network graph tool Biolayout Express3D8,9 show that clusters of genes that are correlated in their expression across large data sets give clear insights into the transcriptional networks of specific tissue or cell types (e.g. the haematopoietic and mesenchymal lineages) and specific cellular functions (e.g. phagocytosis, cell cycle, extracellular matrix). In the current study, we reasoned that by examining a diverse collection of publicly available microarray data from distinct mouse cell populations and tissues, we would be able to identify a co-expressed gene signature that was specific to the FAE and thereby gain insights into the genes that regulate the activity of the cells within it. We also compared the effects of in vivo and in vitro RANKL stimulation on gene expression in the intestinal epithelium. As a consequence, a transcriptional signature was identified that distinguished the FAE from all the other cell and tissue data sets included in this analysis. This study also provides new insight into the effects of RANKL stimulation on gene expression in the FAE. Further characterization of the candidate genes identified in the current study will aid the identification of novel regulators of cell function in the FAE.2. Materials and methods2.1. Selection of gene expression data setsGene expression data sets were selected from the GEO database based on the following three criteria: (i) cell type studied; (ii) chip platform (Affymetrix mouse genome MOE430 2.0 expression arrays) and (iii) availability of raw data (.cel). Raw data (.cel) files were normalized using Robust Multichip Analysis (RMA Express; http://rmaexpress.bmbolstad.com/). Samples were then arranged according to cell-type grouping [intestine, bone marrow (BM) progenitors, myeloid cells, classical DC, lymphocytes, mesenchymal, tissues etc.; Supplementary Table S1]. We also considered data sets from the villous epithelia of mice treated with recombinant RANKL performed on Affymetrix mouse gene 1.0 ST expression arrays5 and in vitro RANKL-stimulated small intestinal organoids performed on Agilent 4 × 44 K whole mouse genome expression arrays (GSE38785).62.2. Network analysisA sample-to-sample correlation matrix was first calculated from the normalized and non-log transformed gene expression data. The matrix was then imported into BioLayout Express3D8,9 and a graph plotted using all sample-to-sample relationships =0.84. Each node represents an individual data set (tissue/cell) and the edges which link these data sets represent Pearson's correlation coefficients =0.84. Next, a pairwise transcript-to-transcript Pearson correlation matrix was calculated based on each transcript's profile across all samples. A Pearson correlation coefficient cut-off threshold of r = 0.85 was selected and an undirected network graph of these data was generated. In this graph, the nodes represent individual probe sets (genes/transcripts) and the edges between them, Pearson's correlation coefficients =0.85. The network was then clustered into groups of probe sets sharing similar profiles using the Markov clustering algorithm using an inflation value (which controls the granularity of clustering)9 of 2.2. Genes in the clusters of interest were assessed for cellular function using literature review and the web-based analysis tools: Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html), GSEA MSigDB (http://www.broadinstitute.org/gsea/msigdb/index.jsp) and GOstat (http://gostat.wehi.edu.au).2.3. Transcription factor binding site motif analysisRefSeq IDs for each transcript on the Affymetrix MOE430_2 array that were present in the cluster of interest derived from the network graph (i.e. had at least one correlation with another transcript with Pearson's r = 0.85) were obtained from the NetAffx database (https://www.affymetrix.com/analysis/netaffx/index.affx). In order to further improve the accuracy of transcriptional start site (TSS) identification, the FANTOM database of mouse cap analysis of gene expression (CAGE) tags and expression (http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/4/download/Tables/mouse/CAGE/promoters/tag_clusters/)10 was used to identify true TSS. By sequencing transcripts from the 5' end and then mapping them to the genome, CAGE provides the state-of-the-art accuracy for the identification of TSS. The most abundantly transcribed CAGE tag in the FANTOM 3 data set within 1000 bp up- or downstream of the annotated RefSeq TSS was taken as the TSS for that gene. Promoter sequences 300 bp upstream and 100 bp downstream of the CAGE-defined TSS were extracted from the mouse genome sequence (version mm9). Transcription factor binding site (TFBS) motifs were identified using the JASPAR CORE 2008 motif set (http://jaspar.cgb.ki.se), and Clover (P = 0.01, score threshold = 6) was used to detect over-represented motifs in the promoters of each gene in cluster 65 compared with a ‘background set’ made up of the 2000-bp upstream sequence from all mouse genes.112.4. MiceAdult (6–12-week-old) C57BL/6 mice and Mfge8-/- mice12 were maintained under specific pathogen-free conditions. All studies using experimental mice and regulatory licences were approved by the University of Edinburgh's Ethical Review Committee and performed under the authority of a UK Home Office Project Licence within the regulations of the UK Home Office ‘Animals (scientific procedures) Act 1986’.2.5. ImmunohistochemistrySerial frozen sections (10 µm in thickness) of Peyer's patches were cut on a cryostat and immunostained with the following antibodies: rat anti-mouse GP2 monoclonal antibody (mAb; MBL International, Woburn, MA, USA) or rabbit anti-annexin-A5 (ANXA5) polyclonal antibody (pAb; Abcam, Cambridge, UK) to detect M cells, goat anti-mouse CCL20 pAb (R&D Systems, Abingdon, UK), Alexa Fluor 488-conjugated hamster anti-mouse CD11c mAb (clone N418; eBioscience, Hatfield, UK), biotinylated rat anti-mouse CD68 mAb (clone FA-11; AbD Serotec, Oxford, UK), biotinylated rat anti-E-cadherin (clone DECMA-1; eBioscience), rabbit anti-human KCNJ15 pAb (Protein Tech Group, Chicago, IL, USA), biotinylated rat anti-mouse CD107a (LAMP-1) mAb (clone 1D4B; Biolegend, Cambridge, UK), rat anti-mouse milk fat globule epidermal growth factor (EGF) factor 8 (MFG-E8) mAb (clone FDC-M1; BD Pharmingen, Oxford, UK) and rabbit anti-ubiquitin D pAb (Protein Tech Group). F-actin was detected using Alexa Fluor 647-conjugated phalloidin (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK). Unless indicated otherwise, following the addition of the primary antibody, species-specific secondary antibodies coupled to Alexa Fluor 488 (green) and Alexa Fluor 555 (red) dyes were used (Invitrogen). TUNEL+ cells were detected using the ApopTag Plus Fluorescence In Situ Apoptosis Detection Kit (Merck Millipore, Billerica, MA, USA). Sections were mounted in fluorescent mounting medium (Dako, Ely, UK) and examined using a Zeiss LSM5 confocal microscope (Zeiss, Welwyn Garden City, UK).2.6. Statistical analysisUnless indicated otherwise, significant differences between groups were sought by ANOVA. P-values <0.05 were accepted as significant.3. Results3.1. Comparison of the cell and tissue gene expression profilesA total of 130 gene expression data sets generated on a single microarray platform (Affymetrix MOE430-2.0) were collected representing 60 different primary mouse cells, tissues and cell lines (Supplementary Table S1). To examine the relationships between samples, a Pearson correlation matrix was first calculated based on the global expression similarities between these normalized data. The matrix was then imported into Biolayout Express3D8,9 and a graph created of the sample-to-sample correlations using the Pearson correlation relationships r = 0.84 to define edges (Fig. 1). Irrespective of the source of these data sets, the different populations of intestinal, lymphoid, myeloid and mesenchymal cells clustered together and occupied specific regions of the graph. For example, most cells and tissues of intestinal origin clustered together in a distinct region of the graph (clusters 4, 5 and 10; Fig. 1). Similarly, most of the haematopoietic and lymphoid cells (clusters 2 and 13), phagocytes (cluster 3) and cells of mesenchymal origin (cluster 1) clustered together in separate regions of the graph. The CT-stimulated villous epithelium data sets were located within a different cluster from the Peyer's patch M cell and FAE data sets (clusters 5 and 4, respectively) implying distinct expression profiles. Clustering of samples based on their global gene expression profile. A Pearson correlation matrix was prepared by comparing data derived from all 130 samples used in this study performed on the Affymetrix mouse genome MOE430 2.0 expression array. A graph was constructed using sample-to-sample relationships greater than r = 0.84. Nodes represent samples (individual chips) and edges are coloured according to the strength of the correlation (red, r = 1.0; blue, r = 0.84). Full descriptions of the sources of each data set are given in Supplementary Table S1.Clustering of samples based on their global gene expression profile.

Identification of cell- and tissue-specific co-expressed genes signaturesNext, a full probe set-to-probe set Pearson correlation matrix was calculated whereby the similarity in the expression profile of each probe set represented on the array was compared across all 130 samples. The resulting three-dimensional network graph contained 18 213 nodes representing individual probe sets connected by 476 858 edges indicating Pearson's correlations r = 0.85. After clustering, 349 clusters of =7 nodes were obtained and their descriptions and contents are provided in Supplementary Tables S2 and S3, respectively. To enable this network graph to be explored in greater detail, these data will be made available as a network graph on the authors' institutional website (http://www.roslin.ed.ac.uk/neil-mabbott).The network graph's topology is derived from cliques of genes which are co-expressed (Fig. 2). Clusters containing genes with related expression patterns were typically localized within similar neighbourhoods of the network graph (Fig. 2B). For example, clusters 2, 17, 36 and 49 were highly expressed by all the intestine-derived data sets and occupied the same region of the network graph, adjacent to the other intestine-related clusters (Fig. 2). Clusters 3, 25 and 40 were highly expressed by Paneth cells and occupied a distinct region of the graph distant from the other intestine-related clusters, but adjacent to the rest of the Paneth cell-related clusters (Fig. 2). Other clusters, such as those expressed highly by B cells (cluster 22), mononuclear phagocytes (cluster 24) and other lymphocyte, leukocyte and haematopoietic cell lineages occupied a specific region of the graph geographically distant from the intestine-related clusters.

Cluster 65 (FAE and Peyer's patch M cell-related) is highlighted.The average expression profile of the probe sets (and the genes they encode) within the individual clusters can give a strong indication of the biology they encode. Many tissue/cell-specific gene clusters were identified. The mean expression profiles of the genes in a selection of example clusters derived from the network graph are shown in Fig. 3, and the mean expression profiles of every cluster are provided in Supplementary Fig. S1. For example, cluster 13 contained many genes characteristically expressed by mesenchymal cells, especially those encoding components of the extracellular matrix (Fig. 3A). Cluster 22 contained genes characteristically expressed by B cells including those encoding immunoglobulins and the major histocompatibility complex class II complex. Cluster 31 contained genes related to T cell activity, cluster 24 was enriched with genes related to mononuclear phagocyte activity including constituents of the lysosomal proton pump (Atp6v0a1etc.; Fig. 3B). Cluster 20 was enriched with genes expressed by natural helper cells, whereas cluster 78 was enriched with genes expressed by lymphoid tissue-inducer cells (Fig. 3C). Several Paneth cell-related clusters were also identified which contained typical genes related to their activity including (Fig. 3D). Some clusters were expressed highly across all samples and predominantly contained housekeeping genes. For example, clusters 19, 21 and 54 were enriched cell cycle-related genes (Fig. 3E), whereas cluster 16 contained genes involved with RNA processing (Fig. 3F).

Identification of an FAE-specific co-expressed gene signatureOur main aim was to use this clustering approach to gain further insights into the biology of the FAE. Cluster 65 contained 29 probe sets encoding 21 annotated genes and the mean expression profile of this cluster was restricted to the FAE and M cells (Fig. 4A). The mean expression level of these genes in the FAE samples was significantly higher when compared with the villous epithelium [ileum epithelial cells, small intestine (SI) epithelium and ileum samples; Fig. 4B]. Several of these genes had previously been reported to be expressed highly throughout the FAE (Anxa10, Ccl20, Psg18 and Ubd), whereas Gp2 is specifically expressed by the M cells within it.2,4,13–15 The expression of CCL20, ubiquitin D and GP2 in the FAE is shown in Fig. 4C. By using the principle of ‘guilt-by-association’, these data suggested that the remaining genes in cluster 65 were also related to FAE function. Analysis of the expression profiles of these potentially novel genes across the different data sets indicated that Calcb, Ces3b, Clca2 and Gjb2 were expressed at highly significant levels within the FAE and Peyer's patch M cell samples when compared with the villous epithelium. Others including Ascl2, Cftr, Fgf15, Gpr133, Kcna1, Kcnj15, Mycl1, Pgap1 and Rps6kl were expressed in the FAE, but not by M cells (Fig. 4B). Expression profiles of the genes within cluster 65.

SED, subepithelial dome. Dotted line indicates the luminal surface of the FAE.CT stimulation is considered to promote the differentiation of villous enterocytes into M cells.4 However, it was noticeable that the CT-stimulated villous epithelium data sets lacked the expression of most of the FAE- and M-cell-related genes in cluster 65 including Gp2 (Fig. 4B) and were situated in a distinct cluster from the FAE and Peyer's patch M cell data sets in the sample-to-sample analysis (Fig. 1). The CT-stimulated villous epithelium data sets were enriched using a mAb which specifically binds sites of a-1,2 fucosylation.4 Although murine M cells express high levels of a-1,2 fucose, the lack of the significant expression of M cell- and FAE-related genes in the CT-stimulated villous epithelium data sets indicates that they most likely contained a mixed population of intestinal epithelial cells that were fucosylated by fucosyltransferase 2 as part of a rapid stress response to oral CT administration.163.4. KCNJ15 expression in the SI is restricted to the FAEAmong the genes in cluster 65 that had not previously been reported to be expressed within the FAE was Kcnj15 which encodes for potassium inwardly rectifying channel, subfamily J, member 15 (KCNJ15). The specificity of the Kcnj15 probe sets was confirmed using the RefDIC probe mapping tool (http://refdic.rcai.riken.jp/tools/id_on_map.cgi) which predicts whether or not each probe set recognizes coding regions of target genes17 (Fig. 5A). A large diversity of potassium channels has been described. However, in the intestine, Kcnj15 was the only subfamily J potassium channel-encoding gene represented on the microarray that was significantly and specifically expressed only within the FAE when compared with the villous epithelium samples (Fig. 5B). Immunohistochemistry (IHC) analysis demonstrated that KCNJ15 was distributed within the cytoplasm of most cells throughout the FAE, but appeared to be absent in GP2+ M cells (Fig. 5C). Consistent with the microarray data, the villous epithelium lacked the expression of KCNJ15. These data support the conclusion that the genes within cluster 65 are expressed highly by cells in the FAE. KCNJ15 is expressed throughout the FAE, but not by M cells or the villous epithelium. (A) The Affymetrix probe sets registered for Kcnj15 which were co-expressed within cluster 65 were surveyed with the RefDIC probe-mapping tool to confirm that they recognized exons within this gene (red bars).

TFBS motif analysis of the promoters of genes within cluster 65We next determined whether the genes within cluster 65 shared transcription factor-responsive elements in their promoters. For each transcript identified in cluster 65, the region -300 to +100 bp of the CAGE-defined TSS was extracted from the mouse genome. Of the probe sets within cluster 65, one (1419775_at) did not have an associated RefSeq ID. For the remaining probe sets, 28 unique RefSeq IDs were identified in the RefSeq mm9 database; however, for three probe sets (1449426_a_at, 1422639_at and 1421658_x_at), no CAGE TSS was found.Significantly over-represented TFBS enrichment in the set of gene promoters within cluster 65 was then assessed using Clover analysis (P-value threshold =0.01).11 The Clover score estimates the degree of over-representation of a given sequence by estimating the thermodynamic binding energy of a transcription factor to the promoter sequences of genes in a given cluster and comparing this to the binding energy of the transcription factor to a control sequence (in this study, the 2000 bp region upstream of all mouse gene promoters).18 The transcription factors that had the highest positive correlations are shown in Supplementary Table S4. The genes within cluster 65 were significantly enriched with 11 candidate TFBS motifs supporting the view that the cluster was distinct and derived from an underlying transcriptional programme. For example, among these, significantly enriched motifs were those for NF-<U+03BA>B and two of its subunits Rel and RelA. The implications of these data are discussed below.3.6. Effect of RANKL stimulation on the expression of FAE-related genes in the villous epitheliumWe next examined gene expression data from the villous epithelium of mice treated with recombinant RANKL performed on Affymetrix mouse gene 1.0 ST expression arrays.5 These data were normalized, annotated and the expression levels of the genes present within cluster 65 compared. Unfortunately, as these samples were analysed on a different microarray platform, it was not possible to combine these data sets with those used in the cluster analysis above. Expression data for 18 orthologs of the 21 annotated genes within cluster 65 were available. Among those genes, nine demonstrated a significant >2.0-fold increase in the villous epithelium after RANKL-treatment including Ccl20, Clca2, Gjb2, Gpr133, Mycl1, Ubd and the M cell-specific marker Gp2 (Supplementary Fig. S2). However, the expression of Anxa10, Ascl2, Kcna1, Kcnj15 and Rps6kl1 was not significantly influenced. These data show that although stromal cells beneath the FAE express high levels of RANKL, not all FAE-related genes are directly dependent on RANKL stimulation for their expression.We next determined the effect of RANKL stimulation on the expression of other FAE- and M cell-related genes. To do so, we identified the genes which were significantly induced >2.0-fold by RANKL stimulation in the villous epithelium and also expressed highly (significantly >2.0-fold) in the enriched Peyer's patch M cells and FAE samples, when compared with the other intestine-related samples. This analysis identified 369 individual genes which were expressed highly by the Peyer's patch M cells and FAE samples, and of these, orthologs for 48 were significantly induced by RANKL stimulation in the villous epithelium (Supplementary Table S5). Among those genes were several, in addition to those in cluster 65, which were known to be expressed highly in the FAE and by M cells including Anxa5, Ccl9, Clu, Ctsh, Icam1, Krt7, Marcksl1, Prnp, Scg5, Spib and Tnfaip2.2,4,5,13,19–22 However, the expression of 32 genes had not implying that they were novel RANKL-dependent FAE-specific genes.In order to further exclude the possibility that the expression of some genes may be due to the presence of mononuclear phagocytes in the original samples, we also analysed expression data from RANKL-stimulated in vitro-cultivated small intestinal organoids. Although important additional stimuli such as those provided by lymphocytes22,23 may be absent in the in vitro organoids, the expression of 30 of the RANKL-dependent M cell- and/or FAE-related genes identified above were also induced in the in vitro organoids data sets (Supplementary Table S5).3.7. Milk fat globule EGF factor 8 is expressed highly by FAE enterocytesAmong the novel genes that were significantly up-regulated by RANKL treatment in the villous epithelium in vivo, and in small intestinal organoids in vitro, was Mfge8 which encodes MFG-E8 (Supplementary Table S5). IHC was used to confirm the expression of MFG-E8 in the FAE. As anticipated, high levels of MFG-E8 were detected in association with mononuclear phagocytes in the B cell follicles and subepithelial domes (SEDs) of Peyer's patches (Fig. 6A, arrowheads). However, strong MFG-E8 immunolabelling was also detected within epithelial cells within the FAE (Fig. 6A, arrow). No MFG-E8 expression was detected in Mfge8-/- mice (Fig. 6A). Since both the anti-GP2 mAb and anti-MFG-E8 mAb were raised in rats, ANXA5 was used as an alternative marker to detect M cells.20 Our analysis showed that MFG-E8 was strongly expressed within FAE enterocytes but not by M cells, since ANXA5+ cells (Fig. 6B, arrows) lacked MFG-E8. Enterocytes in the FAE, but not the villous epithelium, contain large LAMP1+ endosomes towards their apical surfaces.24 In FAE enterocytes, the MFG-E8 was preferentially co-localized to these large LAMP1+ endosomes (Fig. 6C).

(E) Many large MFG-E8-containing CD68+ macrophages were detected in the SED (arrowheads), but were rarely detected in the FAE. Dotted lines indicate the border of the FAE.In the SED, numerous CD11c+ cells (indicative of classical DC) were observed with cytoplasmic inclusions of MFG-E8 (Fig. 6D, arrow). Although occasional CD11c+ cells were detected in the FAE (Fig. 6D, arrowheads), and some contained cytoplasmic inclusions of MFG-E8 (Fig. 6D, arrow), the majority of the MFG-E8 was epithelial cell-associated. MFG-E8-containing CD68+ macrophages were also detected in the SED (Fig. 6E, arrowheads), but were rare in the FAE. These data clearly show that in the FAE, MFG-E8 expression was restricted to the large LAMP1+ endosomes of the enterocytes and was not simply due to the presence of mononuclear phagocytes. This conclusion is consistent with the induction of Mfge8 expression in the in vitro small intestinal organoids which contained only epithelial cells (Supplementary Table S5).63.8. Mfge8 deficiency does not impair apoptotic cell engulfment in the SEDMFG-E8 aids the phagocytic clearance of apoptotic cells by mononuclear phagocytes.12,25 The mononuclear phagocytes in Peyer's patches comprise a heterogeneous population of classical DC and macrophages, and our data show that the majority of those in the FAE and B cell follicles (including tingible body macrophages) express CD11c.26 In the SED of Peyer's patches, cytoplasmic inclusions of MFG-E8 and the epithelial cell marker E-cadherin were detected in mononuclear phagocytes implying the uptake of apoptotic epithelial cells (Fig. 7A and B, arrows). We therefore determined whether the expression of MFG-E8 by the FAE was important for the engulfment of apoptotic cells by mononuclear phagocytes in the underlying SED by comparing the number of phagocyte-associated apoptotic cells in the Peyer's patches of WT and Mfge8-/- mice. In the SED, the mean number of phagocyte-bound apoptotic cells was similar in Peyer's patches from each group of mice indicating that the engulfment of apoptic cells was unaffected in the absence of MGF-E8 (Fig. 7C). In contrast, the apoptotic cell load of phagocytes in the B cell follicles was significantly higher in Peyer's patches from Mfge8-/- mice (Fig. 7D) consistent with previous data.25 These data show that MFG-E8 expression in the FAE does not regulate the engulfment of apoptotic cells by mononuclear phagocytes within the SED. Mfge8 deficiency does not impair apoptotic cell engulfment in the SED. (A) Heavy cytoplasmic inclusions of MEG-E8 (green) and E-cadherin (red) were detected within MNP within the SED (arrows).

DiscussionHere, we used a meta-analysis approach to identify a co-expressed transcriptional signature that distinguished the FAE from a large collection of mouse primary cells, tissues and cell lines. A co-expressed gene cluster (cluster 65) was identified which was highly expressed only in the FAE and by M cells and was enriched with known M-cell- (Gp2) or FAE-specific (Anxa10, Ccl20, Psg18 and Ubd)2,4,13–15 genes. Such clusters of co-expressed genes provide an opportunity to identify novel lineage markers and regulators of cell function, as well as functions for uncharacterized genes. For example, recent studies show that the broad complex, tramtrack, bric-a-brac, and zinc finger transcription factor Zbt46 is specifically expressed by all classical DC lineages.27,28 Retrospective analysis of data from our previous comparison of the transcriptomes of different mouse lymphocyte and leukocyte populations shows that Zbtb46 was co-expressed in a cluster of 12 genes whose expression was restricted to classical DC (cluster 79 in Mabbott et al.7). By applying the principle of ‘guilt-by-association’, this suggested that the other genes co-expressed within cluster 65 in the current study were also FAE-related. These novel FAE-related genes could be separated into two groups: those expressed highly within the FAE and by M cells (Calcb, Ces3b, Clca2 and Gjb2) and those expressed in the FAE, but not by M cells (Ascl2, Cftr, Fgf15, Gpr133, Kcna1, Kcnj15, Mycl1, Pgap1 and Rps6kl). These genes could also be further subdivided depending on their requirement for RANKL-stimulation for their expression. The potential functions of the FAE-related genes identified in this study are summarized in Fig. 8 and examples discussed below.

Genes were classified into groupings of related cellular function based on published data from literature searches. Red font, RANKL-dependent genes; plain font, RANKL-independent genes.Cells in the FAE express high levels of the glycosylphosphatidylinisotol (GPI)-anchored proteins GP2 and cellular prion protein (PrPC, encoded by Prnp).2,4,15 GPI inositol deacylation by post-GPI attachment to proteins 1 (PGAP1, encoded by Pgap1) is important for the efficient transport of GPI-anchored proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum to the Golgi.29Pgap1 was co-expressed with Gp2 within cluster 65 implying an important role in the expression of GPI-anchored proteins in the FAE. GP2 and PrPC may each act as a transcytotic receptors for mucosal antigens on M cells.15,30Prnp did not cluster with other genes across this data set, most likely reflecting its ubiquitous cellular expression.Potassium channels control the apical recycling of potassium ions. Our analysis of the novel genes within cluster 65 revealed that Kcnj15 was specific to the FAE, but was not induced in the villous epithelium after RANKL stimulation. The ion channels Cftr, Clca2 and Kcna1 were also co-expressed within cluster 65, and others (Clca4 and Kctd12) were significantly induced by RANKL stimulation. The role of KCNJ15 and the other ion channels in the FAE is uncertain. Enterocytes within the FAE, unlike those in the villous epithelium, contain large LAMP1+ endosomes.24 These genes may help maintain ion concentrations in the large endosomes of FAE enterocytes.Although RANKL stimulation is important for the maturation and maintenance of M cells, Tnfrsf11a (which encodes RANK) did not cluster with any other gene across this data set. This is most likely due to the additional roles for RANK–RANKL signalling in the function of osteoclasts31 and lymphoid tissue-inducer cells32 that were included in the analysis. Since RANKL may also promote the survival of BM-derived DC and stimulate their expression of pro-inflammatory cytokines,33 our subtraction analysis identified only those RANKL-induced genes which were highly expressed in the FAE and also by Peyer's patch M cells when compared with the villous epithelium. This approach identified 48 genes, many of which were known to be expressed in the FAE and by M cells including Anxa5, Ccl9, Ccl20, Clu, Ctsh, Gp2, Icam1, Krt7, Marcksl1, Prnp, Scg5, Spib, Tnfaip2 and Ubd or were also identified in the current study in cluster 65 (Clca2, Gjb2 and Mycl1).2,4,5,13,20,21,34,35 This implies that the remaining 32 genes represent novel RANKL-dependent FAE-related genes.The genes induced by RANKL stimulation encode proteins with a range of FAE- and M-cell-related activities and are summarized in Fig. 8. Many were associated with cytoskeletal regulation (Epb4.4l2, Fyb, Marksl1, Mreg, Myo1b, Reep1, S100a11 and Tnfaip2) and may play a role in the adaptation of the cell towards one specialized for transcytosis.4,21,36–39 The expression of Anxa5, Clu, Gp2, Mfge8 and Prnp may encode proteins that bind to and regulate the host's response to antigen and pathogens in the intestinal lumen.2,15,25,40,41 Similarly, the expression of Ctsh, Ncf4, Serpina1a/1b, Rnase1 and Ubd suggests a role in antigen processing or pathogen degradation. Chemokines and chemokine receptors mediate the attraction of lymphocytes and leukocytes to lymphoid tissues and control their positioning within them. The chemokine genes Ccl9, Ccl20 and Cxcl11 were up-regulated by RANKL stimulation indicating a role in the attraction of specific cell populations towards the FAE. For example, in Peyer's patches, the CCL20-mediated recruitment of a specific B cell subset towards the FAE is important for maintaining M differentiation.22,42 Consistent with this role, Ccl20 was co-expressed with the other FAE-related genes in cluster 65.Expression of MFG-E8 by the FAE had not previously been reported. The expression of MFG-E8 was significantly up-regulated by RANKL treatment and was preferentially co-localized to the large LAMP1+ endosomes of FAE enterocytes. In the B cell follicles, MFG-E8 produced by stromal follicular DCs aids the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by acting as a bridging molecule between phosphatidylserine residues on apoptotic cells and integrins on mononuclear phagocytes.12,25 However, the engulfment of apoptotic cells by mononuclear phagocytes within the SED beneath the FAE was not impaired in MFG-E8-deficient mice implying an alternative role for FAE-derived MFG-E8. Data show that MFG-E8 can also act as an anti-inflammatory modulator by inhibiting the LPS-mediated release of pro-inflammatory cytokines.43 The phosphatidylserine-binding protein ANXA5 is also expressed highly in the FAE by M cells.20 In addition to its role in regulating the phagocytosis of apoptotic cells, ANXA5 can bind to Gram-negative bacteria with high affinity via the lipid A domain of LPS, blocking the endotoxin activity.40 Thus, in the FAE, the expression of MFG-E8 by enterocytes and ANXA5 by M cells may each play important anti-inflammatory roles to protect against LPS-mediated endotoxemia.The promoter analysis of the cluster 65 genes identified over-representation of 11 candidate TFBS motifs supporting the conclusion that the genes in this cluster shared an underlying transcriptional programme. Many of these motifs bind transcription factors that control epithelial cell and enterocyte differentiation and homeostasis. The nuclear transcription factor Y subunit a can regulate the differentiation of a human epithelial colorectal adenocarcinoma cell line.44 Similarly, hepatocyte nuclear factor 1a maintains enterocyte terminal differentiation and cell fate commitment in the intestinal epithelium.45 Two high mobility group box transcription factors were also identified. Sox9 is expressed in intestinal epithelium stem/progenitor cells and in Paneth cells and can regulate homeostasis in the intestinal epithelium.46 Sox17 can promote the growth and differentiation of respiratory epithelial cells.47,48 Motifs for basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors were also identified by the promoter analysis. Furthermore, genes encoding two bHLH transcription factors, L-myc (encoded by Mycl1) and achaete scute-like 2 (encoded by Ascl2), were co-expressed in cluster 65. These transcription factors are important regulators of cell fate in the intestine49 implying a similar role in the FAE.NF-<U+03BA>B functions as a dimeric transcription factor and plays a central role in regulating gene expression during intestinal inflammation. The identification of enriched binding motifs for NF-<U+03BA>B transcription factor family members is consistent with the role for RANK–RANKL signalling in controlling M cell differentiation.1 RelA has been shown to be required for the homeostatic regulation of cell death and division in the intestinal epithelium under steady-state conditions and for protection during acute inflammation.50 Similarly, in the large intestine, Rel regulates the innate inflammatory response to the gut microflora.51The chronological comparison of the effects of RANKL stimulation on the expression of the cluster 65 genes revealed that although stromal cells beneath the FAE express high levels of RANKL, not all of the FAE-related genes identified in this study are directly induced by RANKL stimulation. Furthermore, although Ccl20, Clca2, Gpr133 and Ubd were rapidly up-regulated following RANKL stimulation, Gp2 and Psg18 were induced at later times. The promoter analysis indicated that Ccl20, Clca2, Gpr133 and Ubd all contained NF-<U+03BA>B family TFBS motifs, whereas they were absent in Gp2 and Psg18. These data indicate that although RANKL stimulation is important for the induction of M cell differentiation from enterocytes, it does not directly regulate the expression of genes such as Gp2 which are associated with terminally differentiated M cells. High levels of the E26 transformation-specific family transcription factor transcription factor Spi-B (encoded by Spib) were induced in the villous epithelium after RANKL stimulation. Recent data show that Spi-B is an important transcription factor which acts downstream of RANKL–RANK signalling to control the subsequent terminal differentiation of functionally mature M cells.5,6Data in this study show that gene expression signatures specifically associated with the FAE and the M cells within it can be readily identified from the meta-analysis of a large collection of publicly available gene expression data. Little is known of the genes that specifically regulate the differentiation and function of cells within the FAE. Further characterization of the candidate genes identified in the current study will aid the identification of novel regulators of FAE and M cell function and homeostasis.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by project and Institute Strategic Programme Grant funding from the Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council (to N.A.M).

IntroductionGenetic modifications at specific sites of animal genomes represent a powerful method for elucidating molecular mechanisms underlying normal and pathological processes.1 In mice, gene targeting (GT) via homologous recombination (HR) in embryonic stem (ES) cells followed by the formation of germline chimeras has been a routine tool, leading to the production of numerous knockout animals to explore the gene functions in the particular processes of normal development and disease models.1,2 This classical approach of knockout production has been limited to mouse and rat,3,4 mainly due to the availability of pluripotent ES cell lines capable of whole animal production via germline transmission.Engineered sequence-specific endonucleases, namely zinc finger nucleases (ZFNs) and transcription activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), have recently attracted considerable attention,5 because they can mediate high efficiencies of GT and thus allow for allelic alterations directly in developing embryos without the intermediate steps such as HR in ES cells, chimera formation from targeted ES cells and germline transmission, which are required in traditional GT experiments. ZFNs have successfully led to the targeted gene disruption (GD) in zebrafish and exogenous GD in medaka.6,7 More recently, TALENs have also been utilized successfully in zebrafish somatic cell cultures and embryos.8,9 These endonucleases can induce double-strand DNA breaks to increase the HR frequency, allowing for gene knockin directly in developing embryos.10 Recent progresses include the development of engineered zinc finger nickases inducing homology-directed repair with reduced mutagenic effects,11 selection-independent generation of gene knockout mouse ES cells using ZFNs12 and monomeric site-specific nucleases for genome editing.13One of the challenges in ZFN- or TALEN-mediated GD experiments is the ability and efficiency to detect the desirable disrupted alleles, which are rare and usually contain minor differences compared with wild-type (WT) alleles,6,8 because ZFN- or TALEN-mediated GD may occur independently and generate various alterations in different cells and embryos and the individuals derived from them may be highly heterogeneous. These minor allelic alterations may be hardly detectable under the standard agarose gel electrophoresis (AGE). Traditionally, three methods are used to detect GD lesions without any requirement for special equipment. These are phenotype selection,6,14 restriction site selection8 and electrophoresis after enzymatic mismatch cleavage.15,16 Phenotype selection is not applicable to many genes that do not show an apparent phenotype after disruption. Restriction site selection requires a specific restriction site within the region of detection: upon disruption, a gene or its fragment may lose the recognition site for a restriction enzyme, leading to a change in the restriction pattern. Enzyme mismatch cleavage is a versatile approach that is widely used in mutation and polymorphism detection,17 because it enables the detection of any allelic variations independent of the corresponding phenotype and restriction site. Allelic sequences can form homoduplex (Hm) or heteroduplex (Ht) when they are subject to repeated cycles of denaturing and annealing as in PCR. The T4 endonuclease VII and T7 endonuclease I (T7) specifically recognize and cut an Ht DNA at the site of mismatch, generating two shorter DNA fragments detectable on ordinary AGE.18 This approach makes use of T7 digestion and AGE, and is thus referred to TAGE subsequently for simplicity.Several other approaches of detecting minor sequence differences require the use of special equipment. Capillary electrophoresis19 uses particular devices and can identify single-molecule differences.20 High-resolution melting analysis21 has recently been used to detect chemically induced point mutations in medaka22 as well as DNA methylation.23 However, specialized instruments designed to monitor fluorescence changes during heating are required.Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (PAGE) provides high-resolution detection of polymorphisms24 and it has also been used to study DNA mismatch repair.25 The usefulness of PAGE for detecting allelic alterations in GD experiments remains to be determined. This study was aimed at the development of procedures for the detection of allelic alterations at high efficiency and resolution. In a biallelic model system, TAGE and PAGE were found to be able to detect minor DNA differences at an efficiency of 6 and 0.4%, respectively. In a multi-allelic model system, PAGE but not TAGE allowed for rapid detection, quantification and enrichment of multiple rare alleles. Most importantly, in a real experiment for ZFN-mediated GT through direct microinjection in medaka embryos, PAGE proved its effectiveness to screen for GT at a particular locus.2. Materials and Methods2.1 Fish and chemicalsWork with fish followed the guidelines on the care and use of animals for scientific purposes of the National Advisory Committee for Laboratory Animal Research in Singapore and approved by this committee (permit number 27/09). Medaka (strains af, HB32C, HdrR, i1, i3 and Orange) was maintained under an artificial photoperiod of 14-h/10-h light/darkness at 26°C as described.26 Chemicals and enzymes were from Sigma-aldrich and Promega unless otherwise indicated.2.2 PlasmidsPlasmid DNA was extracted by using the Qiagen Maxi and Midi preparation kits (Qiagen). WT1 and D18 are 321 and 303 bp in length, respectively, which were PCR-amplified by using primers ATGGTTGAGTCCCAATCTTTTG plus TCAATATCGCTCTGAAACCCAG from two plasmids containing the medaka nanog cDNAs. pWT2 contains a 346-bp insert of the first exon of medaka gsdf gene. The insert was PCR amplified by using primers GGTTCCCAGGCCCCGGGCTAGCAG plus GAAAAGGATCGTTGCAATTCGC and cloned in pGEM-T Easy vector. pD1, pD6, pD7, pA18 and pA3D7 were similar to pWT2 except for deletions (D) or additions (A) of 1, 6, 7 and 18 bp in the insert. These deletions or additions were generated from ZFN-mediated GD in medaka embryos (see below).2.3 Genomic DNA extractionCaudal fin clips were collected from growing or adult fish and incubated overnight at 55°C in 1.5-ml Eppendorf tubes containing 100 µl of lysis buffer (100 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.0, 200 mM NaCl, 0.2% SDS, 5 mM EDTA, pH 8.0 and 100 µg/ml proteinase K). Following heat-inactivation of proteinase K for 10 min at 70°C, DNA was precipitated with 2.5 volume of ethanol and dissolved in 50 µl of TE (10 mM Tris–HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). DNA isolation from whole fish and embryos was performed as described.272.4 Genomic PCR and successive PCRGenomic PCR was run in a 20-µl volume containing 1 µl of fin clips DNA, 50 ng of medaka genomic DNA or 50 pg of linearized plasmid DNA in the absence or presence of 50 ng of medaka genomic DNA for 35 cycles (94°C for 15 s, 60°C for 15 s and 72°C for 30 s) with Takara Ex-Taq DNA polymerase and the supplied buffer.In the case of consecutive rounds of PCR for enrichment for particular fractions, 1 µl of the gel-purified PCR products was used as template for 30 cycles of PCR at the same conditions.2.5 Heteroduplex formationWhen DNA mixtures containing two or more different sequences are used as templates for PCR, heteroduplexes are formed automatically during cycles of denaturing and re-annealing.28 However, to ensure full heteroduplex formation or to generate heteroduplexes between PCR products from two separate reactions, a denaturing and re-annealing procedure was performed. PCR products or mixture of PCR products from separate reactions were heated to 94°C for 3 min and slowly returned to room temperature to form heteroduplexes.292.6 T7 endonuclease I digestion and agarose gel electrophoresisFor the traditional TAGE detection method, 3 µl of PCR product was subjected to digestion with 0.3 U T7 endonuclease I (New England BioLabs) in a 5-µl volume at 37°C for 1.5 h. Then, 5 µl of digested products, together with 3 µl undigested PCR product as control, were mixed with 5× loading dye, and was loaded on the 2% (w/v) agarose gel with 0.05 µg/ml of ethidium bromide to run the electrophoresis under 130 V for 15 min.2.7 Polyacrylamide gel electrophoresisFor our PAGE detection method, 4 µl of PCR products were separated on 8% polyacrylamide gels in 1× TBE buffer using a Mini-Protean electrophoresis unit (Bio-Rad Laboratories) at 100 V for 2 h at room temperature. Gels were submerged in 1× TBE buffer containing 0.05 µg/ml of ethidium bromide for 20 min. Gels were documented on a bioimaging system (Vilber Lourmat).2.8 Gel recovery, cloning and sequencingDNA bands were cut from the gel under UV light and smashed in 10–20 µl TE. After incubation overnight at room temperature, the supernatant containing DNA was used for successive PCR (see above).TA cloning was performed with pGEM-T Easy vectors. DNA mini-preps were prepared according to the standard alkaline lysis protocol30 and used for sequencing on the 3130xl Sequencer (Applied Biosystems). Sequence alignment and analysis were done by using Vector NTI and DNAman.2.9 ZFN-mediated GDExpression vectors pZN1gsdf and pZN2gsdf (see Supplementary data) were supplied commercially (Toolgene, South Korea). They encode a pair of ZFNs that target the first exon of the medaka gsdf gene (unpublished data). After linearization with ApaI, both vectors were used for mRNA synthesis by using the T7 RNA polymerase (Invitrogen) as described.31 The mRNAs were mixed at 1:1 ratio and microinjected at 20–100 ng/µl into embryos of af and HdrR medaka at the 1-cell stage as described.31 The injected embryos were analysed or allowed to develop into adulthood.2.10 Step-by-step procedureWe are interested in versatile procedures for use in most ordinary laboratories without specialized equipment. Therefore, we developed a PAGE detection procedure, as is indicated in Fig. 1A, which can be streamlined as follows: Heteroduplex production and detection by TAGE and PAGE.

This figure appears in colour in the online version of DNA Research.DNA extraction: extract and purify genomic DNA from gene-disrupted individuals.Primers design: design a pair of primers flanking the ZFN/TALEN cleavage site to yield PCR products of ~300 bp.Genomic PCR: perform PCR with the DNA samples, one WT sample as negative control and one mixture of mutant and WT alleles as positive control if available.Heteroduplex formation: for heterozygous founder individuals containing disrupted alleles, heteroduplexes are formed during PCR. No additional step is required;for progenies that might be homozygous, each PCR product should be mixed with WT PCR product with a ratio of ~1:1, heated to 94°C for 3 min and slowly returned to room temperature to form heteroduplexes.PAGE detection: prepare 8% polyacrylamide gels with 1× TBE buffer;4–6 µl of PCR product is loaded with 6× loading dye to each well of the gel. Electrophoresis is carried out at 12 V/cm for =2 h;the gels are stained with 0.05 µg/ml ethidium bromide for 20 min and documented on a bio-imaging system.Allelic alteration identification: bands of the sample are compared with those of the negative control. The presence of different bands from the control indicates allelic alterations. If positive control shows no heteroduplex band, experiment should be redone.Repeat Steps 3–6 to reduce or eliminate false-positive samples.Gel recovery, cloning and sequencing: bands of heteroduplexes are recovered by smashing and soaking in 10–20 µl of TE in 37°C for overnight;321 µl of the recovered DNA are used as templates for one round of successive PCR of 30 cycles;the products are TA cloned into pGEM-T Easy vector. At least 10 colonies are picked to do mini-preps to collect plasmid DNA using the standard alkaline–SDS procedure;sequencing is run on the insert of the plasmid DNA and the result is compared with the WT allele to validate allelic variations.3. Results3.1 Rationale and experimental designFollowing the procedure above, after repeated PCR cycles of denaturing and annealing, genomic DNA containing gene-targeted alleles will generate three types of PCR products, namely, wild-type (WT) homoduplex (Hm), mutant (MT) Hm and WT–MT heteroduplex (Ht). These PCR products do not show a visible difference on AGE. In TAGE, Ht DNA fragments are cut by T7 at the mismatch site and become distinguishable from the uncut Hm molecules, which can be discriminated as distinct bands on AGE.Alternatively, on native PAGE, such PCR products can be directly separated due to the differences in configuration and length. Since Ht shift slower than Hm on PAGE, Ht bands can be found clearly on the top of Hm bands, as an unambiguous indicator of successful GD. Moreover, after PAGE, all PCR products remain intact. Accordingly, Ht DNA fragments are recoverable from the gel for cloning and sequencing, or can be further re-amplified by consecutive rounds of PCR before cloning and sequencing. Therefore, PAGE features high resolution of separation and the integrity of DNA fragments, which should permit separation and quantification of each PCR product, and more importantly, selective enrichment of Ht DNA for analysis. Its quantification ability leads to an estimation of GD proportion in a sample, providing information for deciding the sample size for screening by cloning and sequencing. Its enrichment ability reduces the WT alleles by eliminating Hm fractions, facilitating the identification of GD-containing samples via reducing the workload of cloning and sequencing in each sample.3.2 Biallelic modelThe procedures and the usefulness of TAGE and PAGE were first established and evaluated for Ht detection in a biallelic model system. To this end, two plasmids, WT1 and D18, which contain an insert of 321 and 303 bp as the WT allele and 18-bp deletion allele (thus D18) of the medaka nanog gene respectively, were linearized and mixed to form a series of dilution (D18 diluted by WT1 at a factor of 2–256). The serial dilution mixtures were used as the templates for PCR and PCR products were subjected to TAGE and PAGE detection.On TAGE, Hm WT1 and D18 fragments remained intact and appeared as bands that were slightly different in size (Fig. 1B). When mixed at a 1:1 ratio, WT1 and D18 without T7 cleavage produced a double band and, upon T7 cleavage, formed two distinct bands with a similar intensity. Serial dilution revealed that D18 remained detectable at a dilution factor of 16, producing a sensitivity level of ~6.3% for TAGE in Ht detection (Fig. 1B). In consistence with the principle of TAGE, T7 digestion leads to reduced band intensities. These observations reveal the feasibility and sensitivity of the established TAGE procedure for Ht detection. On the other hand, in the PAGE detection procedure, D18 remained detectable even at a dilution factor of 256 (Fig. 1C). This produces a sensitivity level of ~0.4% for PAGE in Ht detection, which is 16-fold more efficient than TAGE.A closer inspection revealed several advantageous features of PAGE procedure for detecting allelic modifications (Fig. 1C). WT1 and D18 Hm fragments formed distinct bands of sufficient difference in size. Moreover, Ht fragments migrated at a much lower rate than Hm fragments and formed bands with a clear distance from Hm DNAs. As illustrated in Fig. 1A, two alleles will form two different configurations of Ht fragments depending on the involvement of top or bottom strands of WT or MT alleles.33 In our biallelic model, WT1 and D18 formed two configurations, which were resolved as two distinct bands on PAGE (Fig. 1C). Consequently, PCR products from a biallelic DNA template give rise to four distinct bands, compared with two visible bands in TAGE (compare Fig. 1B and C). In addition, Ht fragments on TAGE formed a faint band that was embedded in a smear at a dilution factor of 16 (Fig. 1B), compared with clear bands with little background even at a dilution factor of 256 (Fig. 1C). Most importantly, upon increasingly serial dilution, the Hm fragment of D18 as the rare allele became invisible but contributed to Ht formation, thus increasing the detection sensitivity.To mimic the real situation of detecting allelic alterations in a targeted genome, the serially diluted mixtures of linearized WT1 and D18 (cDNA original) were added to medaka genomic DNA and subjected to analyses by PCR and PAGE. As illustrated in Supplementary Fig. S1, addition of af genomic DNA did not interfere with the formation of Ht fragments and their detection by PAGE, because the band pattern and detectable dilution factor remained unchanged with genomic DNA (compare Fig. 1C with Supplementary Fig. S1). Taken together, in a biallelic model system, TAGE is able to detect a subtle allelic alteration at a limited resolution and sensitivity of 6.3%, whereas PAGE offers high resolution and sensitivity of 0.4% in the absence and presence of genomic DNA.It needs to be noted that, allelic differences, either natural polymorphisms or experimentally induced alterations, will generate Ht PCR products and Ht bands on PAGE. To understand the impact of sequence polymorphisms on our PAGE procedure, we tested the PCR products of gsdf locus from two medaka inbred lines along with our gene targeted fish 4 (see below) in three lengths: 572, 372 and 305 bp. Primers used are listed in Supplementary Fig. S2. The result indicates that PCR products of af sample exhibit more natural polymorphism Ht bands (asterisks) than HdrR in size of 572 and 372 bp (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Following the PAGE recovery procedure provided above, we sequenced the asterisked Ht and discover a 10 bp deletion polymorphism in af (Supplementary Fig. S2B). By shortening the PCR product size to bypass the polymorphism site (Supplementary Fig. S2B), af shows only faint background bands. Meanwhile, fish 4 PCR products of both sizes exhibit additional bands, which are generated from GT. Therefore, a WT sample serving as a negative control is required in every batch of our PAGE detection.3.3 Multi-allelic model systemIn the practice of ZFN-mediated GT experiments, additions and deletions may occur independently at different stages of development and in different cells, leading to the production of various different MT alleles. We furthered our experiments to establish and utilize a multi-allelic model system for the detection by PAGE. To this end, a set of five different alleles were produced within exon 1 of the medaka gsdf gene via ZFN-mediated GT in medaka embryos (see below). They were WT2, A18, D7, D6 and D1 (Fig. 2A). WT2 of 320 bp in length is the WT allele of gsdf (WT1 described above is the WT allele of the medaka nanog). These allelic sequences were cloned in pGEM-T Easy, and linearized plasmids were mixed at various ratios as described in Fig. 2B. As expected, PCR produced a single band on PAGE when DNA containing a single plasmid was used as template (lanes 1–5, Fig. 2B), while allelic variations, as tiny as 1-bp difference, were clearly distinguishable on PAGE as Hm and Ht forms (lanes 6, 7, 9, 11, Fig. 2B). Notably, PAGE is capable of simultaneous detection of multiple alleles as distinct bands (lanes 8, 10, 12, 13, Fig. 2B). To confirm that the Ht bands are not from artificial non-specific PCR products, PCR products manifesting single band in lanes 1–5 of Fig. 2B were mixed at the same ratio as indicated in Fig. 2B and then were subjected to a heteroduplex formation procedure. PAGE profiles (Supplementary Fig. S3) of these mixtures show exactly the same patterns as in Fig. 2B. PAGE detection of multiple alleles.

Abundances of these Ht products show a positive correlation with the corresponding allelic abundance as depicted by the colour gradient. Therefore, not all Ht bands are visible, and the number of Ht bands on PAGE will indicate the minimal number of allelic alterations in a sample.3.4 Enrichment of rare allelesA final proof for targeted alterations in a ZFN-treated sample comes from sequence analysis. ZFN-mediated GT has been reported to occur in 1–3% cells of zebrafish embryos,34,35 where only one gene copy is targeted in most cases. Consequently, the targeted allele is usually present at ~1% in total genomic DNA from a positive sample. Accordingly, the validation of GT is a time-consuming task in a ZFN-mediated GT experiment, because it requires preparing and sequencing several hundreds of recombinant colonies.34,35 The high resolution and band distinctness of intact PCR products on PAGE provoked us to develop a procedure of enriching for rare alleles, which is gel recovery and successive PCR (grsPCR). In grsPCR, Ht bands of first-round PCR are gel recovered, and DNA is released by diffusion from gel slices for use as template for successive rounds of PCR. To test this procedure, a DNA mixture of four alleles at defined ratio (column 1, Fig. 3C) was used for first round of PCR; Ht fractions were gel recovered collectively, and DNA released was used for second and third rounds of PCR (Fig. 3A), and PCR products were quantified by densitometry (Fig. 3B) and cloned for validation by sequencing (Fig. 3C). Upon two to three rounds of PCR, an increase in Ht fractions was indeed apparent on both PAGE and TAGE when compared with the Hm fractions (Fig. 3A). To quantify a change in intensity during grsPCR, various bands were defined and measured by densitometry (Supplementary Fig. S4A and B). According to the band patterns of this four-allelic model system as shown in Fig. 2B, major bands of the four alleles are identifiable, which permits intensity quantifications of the four alleles by combining two bands of each allele (Supplementary Fig. S4C). In this way, the intensity of dominant WT allele was found to be reduced considerably from 62.0% in the first PCR over 36.0–26.3%, while intensities of rare alleles increased after one and two rounds of grsPCR (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S4C). Cloning and sequencing led to a similar enrichment factor (Fig. 3C). After one single round of grsPCR, for example, the WT allele decreased from 79 to 55%, and rare alleles increased relatively. This verifies quantitative enrichment for rare alleles. Taken together, PAGE profile enables the quantification of each component, while grsPCR allows for the enrichment of multiple rare alleles.

We wanted to demonstrate the usefulness of PAGE in a real experiment of direct GT in embryos of a vertebrate. We chose the ZFN approach and medaka as the model organism. Medaka is a laboratory fish and a lower vertebrate model for stem cell biology27,36,37 and germ cell biology.31,38 Its genome has been sequenced (http://www.ensembl.org/index.html). There are many inbred lines/strains (http://biol1.bio.nagoya-u.ac.jp:8000/) and experimental tools including embryo microinjection.31,39,40We are interested in the development of approaches for direct GT by using ZFNs and TALENs in medaka. By microinjection of RNAs for a pair ZFNs into embryos of af medaka, we obtained several targeted alleles at the medaka gsdf, a gene whose RNA expression is spatially and temporally correlated with early testicular differentiation.41 Four of the alleles were used in the multi-allelic model assay described above (Figs 2 and 3). More than hundred of fish derived from ZFN-injected embryos were grown into adulthood. Genomic DNA was extracted from fin clips of a subset of samples and subjected to TAGE and PAGE assays. We detected successful GT in 2 out of 48 fish examined, because the two fish (4 and 6) exhibited clear bands of Ht PCR products on PAGE (Fig. 4A), and a smear or faint band indicative of Ht products on TAGE (Fig. 4B). The band patterns of two fish samples on PAGE and TAGE were similar to that observed in model systems (Figs 1 and 2). Sequencing 72 recombinant colonies of the Ht PCR products from the third-round PCR (a total of two rounds of grsPCR) revealed three different alleles. One is the WT allele that was present in 45 clones (63%), and the remainder is targeted alleles D7 (22%) and A3D7 (15%; Supplementary Fig. S5). Interestingly, allele A3D7 has both a 3-bp addition and a 7-bp deletion, and more intriguingly, also four mismatches of 1–2 bp each at three separate positions. It follows that ZFNs can simultaneously introduce addition, deletion and mutation into one and same targeted allele. Hence, ZFN-mediated endogenous GT is possible in medaka embryos, and PAGE is effective in detecting and cloning ZFN-targeted rare alleles in fish. Detection of ZFN-mediated allelic alterations in medaka. Medaka embryos were microinjected with RNAs for a pair of ZFNs that targeted the first exon of gsdf locus, and were allowed to develop into adult animals. Genomic DNA was extracted from fin clips of eight randomly sampled adults and was subjected to PCR and PAGE detection of targeted allelic alterations.

DiscussionThe introduction of engineered ZFNs6,42 and TALENs8,9 has made it possible to achieve GT directly in developing animal embryos and selection-independent GT in mouse ES cells.12 The ability to efficiently identify subtle allelic alterations is essential in these ZFN- and TALEN-mediated GT experiments. In this study, we have developed TAGE and PAGE in model systems and a real GT experiment as versatile procedures for detecting allelic variations in ordinary laboratories without specialized equipment and devices. Under our conditions, TAGE identifies the digests of mismatch-containing Ht fragment as a clear band when the rare allele is present =6.3% in a biallelic model system, but as a faint band within a smear in DNA containing ZFN-altered alleles. These results demonstrate the ability and limit of TAGE in allelic detection, as has well be documented.17We showed that PAGE is of choice because of its five major advantages over TAGE. First, PAGE is straightforward and does not require any additional step of enzymatic treatment of PCR products, facilitating the cloning of wanted PCR products by gel recovery. Secondly, PAGE is capable of detecting rare alleles as low as 0.4%, sensitivity of which is 16 times higher than TAGE. Thirdly, PAGE provides an extremely high resolution, as desirable allelic alterations are present in heteroduplexes that form distinct bands with large distances from the bulk WT homoduplex, which enables the simultaneous identification and quantification of multiple different alterations. Fourthly, PAGE allows for discrimination between Ht from natural polymorphisms and those introduced by GD. Finally, on the basis of high resolution and band distinctness of intact PCR products on PAGE, we have developed a gel recovery and successive PCR procedure, which, for the first time to our knowledge, enables enrichment for rare alleles. The percentage of the rare alleles could reach 37% in our experiment (Supplementary Fig. S5); hence, only dozens of recombinant colony sequencing are needed to detect the desirable rare alleles, considerably reducing the work load compared with previous studies when hundreds of colonies were sequenced.34,35PAGE has been used for heteroduplex analysis for years with well-established model systems.28,29,33,43 Based on these previous reports and our experience, for PAGE detection, we suggest that the design of PCR primers amplifying fragments around 300 bp, which can save the time of electrophoresis and avoid polymorphisms while containing enough sequence information. Natural polymorphisms will exhibit Ht bands, thus it is necessary to add one sample of the WT allele in every batch of our PAGE detection as negative control. Only those showing different patterns or additional bands compared with the WT sample can be deemed as positive ones. This represents one of the merits of the PAGE method because in the T7 detection method, polymorphisms cannot be distinguished from introduced mutation since they show similar shortened bands. Also the PAGE method provides a tool to survey the site of interest for natural polymorphisms, revealing the suitability of each animal population for such GT experiments.As for the detection for progenies of GD individuals, which might contain homologous disrupted sequence, a heteroduplex formation procedure after mixing with WT PCR product is necessary to avoid omission. In addition, our protocol also suggests repeating the detection for positive samples to rule out false-positive ones.Since PAGE is only a quick screening method, we might overlook certain one-base-deletion or point mutation in our sample. For point mutation, previous research using ‘hydrolink mutation detection enhancement gels’ cannot detect all types of the mutation via heteroduplex analysis.33 However, almost all published cases of deletion or addition occur in ZFN/TALEN-mediated GT show disruption with more than 1 bp.6–8,34,35,42 These large lesions can be detected by our PAGE method clearly.Our first trial of ZFN-mediated GT in medaka has led to the production and identification of several different alleles from a limited number of embryos and growing animals, revealing the functionality of ZFNs used and the efficiency of this ZFN-mediated GT approach in this organism. It needs to be noted that ZFNs are capable of simultaneous introduction of addition, deletion and point mutation in a single allele, pointing the proficiency of ZFNs in producing a wide variety of targeted allelic alterations in medaka.Although developed for analysing experimentally induced minor sequence differences, our procedures, PAGE in particular, will find a wide variety of applications in detection, quantification and enrichment of polymorphisms and alterations in basic and applied research as well as medicine.Authors’ contributionsThe manuscript was written through contributions of all authors.

IntroductionWith currently >4000 publications available from PubMedCentral alone, ‘Synechocystis’ is the most widely used photoautotrophic prokaryotic model organism. Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is a unicellular cyanobacterium that was isolated from a freshwater pond in Oakland, California.1 The high popularity of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 stems from the two facts that it was the first phototrophic and the third organism overall, for which a complete genome sequence was determined,2 and that it easily takes up exogenous DNA and integrates it into its chromosome by homologous recombination.3–5Synechocystis sp. PCC6803 is known to occur in several distinct substrains, all going back to the same isolate deposited in the Pasteur Culture Collection.6 Indeed, several studies reported the differences between the genome sequence of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 published in 1996 (called here the ‘GT-Kazusa’ substrain) and the actual sequence found in different laboratories.7–10 A strain history has been proposed by Ikeuchi and Tabata8 with an early branching into the motile PCC strain and the non-motile ATCC 27184 strain. The latter lost motility due to a 1-bp insertion in the spkA gene coding for a eukaryotic-type Ser/Thr protein kinase11 and represents the origin of the glucose-tolerant (GT) strains5 to which also the ‘GT-Kazusa’ substrain belongs.For decades, Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 has served as a simple model in photosynthesis research and to solve fundamental questions in microbial and plant physiology. More recently, cyanobacteria are increasingly being recognized as a promising resource for the production of biofuels such as hydrogen,12 ethanol,13 isobutyraldehyde and isobutanol,14 ethylene15 and alkanes.16Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 is being developed further as a model in these biotechnology- and systems biology-oriented studies. These facts as well as the search for motility-associated genes prompted several re-sequencing studies of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 substrains, namely of the substrains GT-S,10 PCC-P, PCC-N, GT-I9 and YF.17 However, these studies have not included the widely used GT and motile ‘Moscow’ substrain, which we here suggest to call ‘PCC-M’. Furthermore, thus far no attention has been paid to the possible sequence variations in the seven plasmids, which constitute a total sequence length of 383 486 bp almost 10% of the total coding capacity of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. This analysis provides new and reliable sequence data for the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 substrain ‘PCC-M’, revealing several differences from the published sequence that can be interpreted as the traces of microevolution during cultivation in the laboratory.2. Materials and methods2.1. Origin of strain, isolation of DNA and PCR analysisSynechocystis sp. PCC 6803 substrains ‘Moscow’ here called ‘PCC-M, Kazusa (GT-Kazusa) and Vermaas’ (GT-V) were cultivated by Prof. Annegret Wilde (University of Freiburg, Germany) and maintained as frozen stocks. The ‘PCC-M’ substrain was originally obtained from the laboratory of S. Shestakov (Moscow State University) in 1993 and over the years carefully propagated for motile colonies. The ‘GT-V’ strain originates from the laboratory of W. Vermaas (Arizona State University). Genomic DNA for deep sequencing analysis was isolated from 80 ml cultures harvested on a glass microfiber filter (GF/C, 47 mm i.d. Whatman) by vacuum filtration. The frozen filter was ground in a mixer mill (Dismembrator MM301, Retsch, Germany) and the powder transferred into 1 ml SET buffer on ice (25% (w/v) sucrose, 1 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris pH 7.5). One-fourth volume of 0.5 M EDTA, 2% SDS and 1.5 mg proteinase K (Sigma) were added for cell lysis at 50°C overnight. Following phenol/chloroform extraction, one volume of 2-propanol (Roth, Germany) was added for precipitating the DNA at room temperature for 30 min. The precipitate was washed once in H2O/2-propanol 1:1 and once in 2-propanol, followed by 10 min centrifugation at 10 000 g, 4°C. The pellet was washed with 70% EtOH, dried for 10 min and re-suspended in 50 µl H2O. One microlitre of RNase A (Sigma) was added and the tube incubated at 37°C and 260 rpm overnight. RNase was removed by another round of phenolic extraction and precipitation as described above. The DNA was re-suspended in 75 µl H2O, concentration was measured photometrically and DNA quality checked on a gel (0.8% agarose).Genomic DNA for PCR was isolated from the cell pellet of 1 ml Synechocystis liquid culture. The pellet was washed once with a 1:10 dilution of TE buffer (10 mM Tris HCl pH 8; 1 mM EDTA) and re-suspended in 70 µl of the same buffer. Cells were broken by incubation at 98°C for 10 min. After centrifugation at 14 000 g and 4°C for 5 min, the supernatant was collected and kept on ice. Two microlitres of it were used for PCR. For PCR reactions, Phusion® DNA polymerase (Finnzymes, New England Biolabs) was used according to the manufacturer's instructions. To verify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between the different substrains, ~500 bp fragments containing the SNP position were amplified. PCR products were excised from an agarose gel, purified (illustra GFX PCR DNA and Gel Band Purification Kit, GE Healthcare) and sent for Sanger sequencing to GATC Biotech (Konstanz, Germany). For sequencing of the small plasmids, several PCR reactions were performed to get overlapping sequences and contigs were assembled using the software ContigExpress (Vector NTI Advance 11, Invitrogen). Alignments of the sequences were performed using AlignX (Vector NTI Advance 11, Invitrogen).2.2. Sequencing methods and mappingSequencing of genomic DNA was carried out on an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx system. Prior to sequencing, the DNA was sheared by ultrasonication (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA), resulting in fragments of 300 bp length on average. For these fragments paired-end sequencing according to the manufacturer's protocol was carried out, resulting in 42 143 495 million 101 nt long reads. These reads were analysed with two methods in order to identify SNPs, deletions and insertions. For the first approach, we used the DNA sequence data assembler algorithm MIRA (Mimicking Intelligent Read Assembly)18 to perform an assembly of the reads using the ‘GT-Kazusa’ genome as the reference. In the assembly process, MIRA generates tables of candidate SNPs, insertions and deletions. We verified these results independently by mapping all sequencing reads to the assembled chromosome and plasmid sequences. This was done using segemehl,19 requiring at least 85% accuracy and reporting only the best hit. It should be noted that segemehl reports co-optimal best hits.3. Results3.1. OverviewSequencing of the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 ‘Moscow’ substrain ‘PCC-M’ by Illumina (Solexa) yielded an average 1100-fold coverage of the chromosome and five of the seven plasmids. The existence of the two remaining plasmids was verified individually by PCR. Following assembly of sequences, mapping to the reference strain sequences and annotation, the obtained genome and plasmid sequences were deposited in the GenBank database with the accession numbers CP003265–CP003272.Altogether, we found 45 differences (36 SNPs and 9 indels >1 bp) between the investigated substrain ‘PCC-M’ and the published sequences of the ‘GT-Kazusa’ chromosome2 and plasmids20 used here as references (Table 1). From these differences, 41 are located in the chromosome and four in the plasmids pSYSA, pSYSM and pCA2.4. For verification, about one-third of these differences were randomly chosen and confirmed independently by PCR and Sanger sequencing of the respective regions in substrain ‘PCC-M’, but no misidentified mutations were found. These DNA regions were, in addition, amplified and compared with the sequences from substrains ‘GT-Kazusa’ and ‘GT-V’ for control and comparison, respectively. The GT ‘GT-V’ was chosen for comparison as is widely used for the dissection and analysis of photosynthetic mutants. Fully segregated PSI, PSII and Chl biosynthesis mutants were successfully generated in this genetic background21,22 and some of these mutants could not be obtained in other substrains.23Location and effects of SNPs and indels found in ‘PCC-M’ compared with the nucleotide sequence of ‘GT-Kazusa’ in the databaseThe events are numbered (column #), the type of mutation (M) is indicated as S, substitution, D, deletion or I, insertion, together with the respective start and end positions in the ‘GT-Kazusa’ reference sequence.

Highlighted in italics are four instances of missing ISY203 copies and in bold all SNPs affecting intergenic spacer regions (IGR).aIndicate errors in the database.The number of differences between ‘PCC-M’ and ‘GT-Kazusa’ are almost twice as many as reported by Tajima et al.10 for the GT (GT-S) ‘Kazusa’ strain, where a total of 22 differences from the published sequence were found.10 All but 3 of those 22 differences were also detected in the ‘PCC-M’ strain studied here. The three unique differences in the ‘GT-S’ and 26 differences between ‘PCC-M’ and ‘GT-Kazusa’ underline the existence of lineage splitting in the Synechocystis substrains. Moreover, we found seven SNPs (#5, 13, 15, 16, 27, 32 and 33 in Tables 1 and 2) and one larger indel (#6 in Tables 1 and 2) specifically shared between the ‘PCC-M’ and the ‘PCC-N and PCC-P’ substrains, indicating that ‘PCC-M’ belongs to the ‘PCC’ group of motile substrains.9 ‘PCC-M and PCC-P’ are strains that both exhibit the native positive phototaxis, whereas ‘PCC-N’ strain shows negative phototaxis.24Comparison of SNPs and indels found in the chromosome of ‘PCC-M’ with sequences from other substrainsAll events are numbered (column #) as in Table 1. The presence of the respective ‘PCC-M’ mutation in the different substrains is indicated by the check marks.aThe deletion of 0.6 kb in the gene slr1753 compared with the reference was also verified here in ‘GT-Kazusa’.Comparison of SNPs and indels found in the chromosome of ‘PCC-M’ with sequences from other substrainsAll events are numbered (column #) as in Table 1.

SNPs in protein-coding genesOf the total of 36 SNPs in ‘PCC-M’ compared with ‘GT-Kazusa’, all except 1 are located in the chromosome. The single base substitution that was found on the plasmid pCA2.4 within the repA gene (#42 in Table 1) seems to be no mutation but an error in the published sequence of ‘GT-Kazusa’, since in our PCR-control experiments, the sequence was identical in the three strains ‘GT-Kazusa’, ‘PCC-M’ and ‘GT-V’. Of the 35 chromosomal SNPs compared with ‘GT-Kazusa’, 5 are silent base substitutions, 14 substitutions lead to amino acid substitutions, in 6 cases a single basepair is deleted and in 2 cases (#23 and #28) one basepair was inserted within an ORF, causing a frameshift mutation. Furthermore, five substitutions, two single basepair insertions and one single basepair deletion were observed in intergenic regions (IGR) of ‘PCC-M’ compared with the reference (Table 1).Seven SNPs are specifically shared between the ‘PCC-M’, ‘PCC-N and PCC-P’ substrains. These are in slr1865 (#13), encoding a hypothetical protein, in sll1951 (#15), encoding a haemolysin-like protein, in slr1983 (#16), encoding a two-component hybrid sensor and regulator protein, in slr0222 (#27), encoding the histidine kinase Hik25, a silent mutation in slr0302 (#32), encoding a PAS/PAC and GAF sensors-containing diguanylate cyclase, one missing basepair, leaving the spkA gene intact (#5) and, finally, in ssr1176 (#33), encoding a transposase (Tables 1 and 2).The gene for a cell surface-localized haemolysin-like protein, HlyA (sll1951), reported to function as a barrier against the adsorption of toxic compounds,25,26 is lacking one nucleotide in ‘PCC-M’ compared with the reference (difference #15). In the ‘GT-Kazusa’, ‘GT-V’ as well as the ‘GT-I’ and ‘GT-S’ strains,9 the presence of the additional A leads to the fusion of two ORFs that are separate in ‘PCC-M’, ‘PCC-N’ and ‘PCC-P’ substrains.9 As a result, Sll1951 is 1741 amino acids in the former and only 1437 residues in the latter.In our data, some other previously published mutations8,10 are confirmed. For instance, spkA (sll1574; #5), a regulator of cellular motility via phosphorylation of membrane proteins,11,27 is disrupted by a 1-bp insertion in the non-motile ‘GT-Kazusa’ and ‘GT-V’ strains, whereas it is intact in the motile ‘PCC-M’ strain (Table 1). Similarly, the pilC gene (slr0162/3) required for pili assembly has been reported to carry a frameshift mutation in the ‘GT-Kazusa’ and ‘GT-S’ sequences.8,10,28 We found an intact pilC gene in ‘PCC-M’ (#20), as well as in the ‘GT-V’ substrain.Another SNP (G–A) exists in psaA (slr1834; #9), encoding the photosynthetic P700 apoprotein subunit Ia; however, in accordance with Tajima et al.10, we believe this is an annotation error in the database as we found an A in the respective position in all three strains dealt with in this work (Table 1). Similarly, ycf22 (sll0751; #26) is here suggested to be fused to the downstream reading frame sll0752. Indeed, in blastp comparisons, both proteins together match against a single, widely distributed, larger protein of 452 amino acids. This protein possesses a Ttg2C domain (COG1463), which is found in an ABC-type transport system involved in resistance to organic solvents. The acronym ycf stands for hypothetical chloroplast reading frames, meaning proteins conserved in chloroplasts and also cyanobacteria. The 1-bp shorter version, which is splitted into sll0751/sll0752, is a database error in the case of ‘GT-Kazusa’ as well.Six of the 10 SNPs unique to ‘PCC-M’ are located within coding regions and cause amino acid substitutions or alter the length of the respective reading frame.A single basepair transversion in the gene sigF (slr1564; #39 in Table 1) is leading to a M231K substitution within the -35 element DNA-binding region29 of a group 3 sigma factor required for phototactic movement30 and salt-stress response.31 This SNP cannot lead to impaired motility as ‘PCC-M’ is motile but it might influence the DNA–protein interaction of SigF because positively charged residues such as lysine located in this part of the s4.2 region can directly interact with DNA.29Another transversion, in argB (slr1898; #8 in Table 1), leads to an S2N amino acid substitution in N-acetylglutamate kinase, the enzyme performing the first committed step of Arg biosynthesis. Transitions in sll1359 and slr1609 (#11 and #3 in Table 1) result in an N–K substitution at a very conserved position within a predicted cytochrome and an L608S (L548S) substitution in the long-chain acyl-CoA-synthetase Slr1609 that has been found crucial for fatty acid activation and the biosynthesis of alkanes.32 Interestingly, an unrelated SNP exists at position 488 923 within the slr1609 coding sequence in a strain ‘YF’, leading to a G546L (G486L) substitution.17 It should be noted that the slr1609 reading frame has been annotated 60 codons shorter (636 instead of 696 amino acids) during recent re-sequencing analyses,9,10 compared with the original annotation of ‘GT-Kazusa’ (numbers in brackets). The shorter Slr1609 protein of 636 amino acids is also consistent with the mapped start site of transcription at position 487 352,33 located 115 nt upstream of the revised start codon.A transition in slr0753 (#41 in Table 1) leads to a P113L substitution in a putative chloride efflux transport protein involved in maintaining the chloride ion concentration homoeostasis as required for a functional photosystem II.34A single basepair deletion in sll1496 (#38 in Table 1), encoding mannose-1-phosphate guanyltransferase, causes a frameshift and premature stop of the gene in ‘PCC-M’. The resulting protein is with 515 instead of 643 amino acids severely truncated and may be rendered function-less.3.3. Point mutations in IGRsCompared with the reference, eight SNPs are located in IGRs, three of these (#7, 24 and 36) are ‘PCC-M’ specific. One of these (#36 in Table 1) SNPs is predicted to affect one of the recently reported cis-antisense RNAs.33 The additional A between positions 3194022 and 3194023 is located in the IGR between genes slr0533 and slr0534, encoding histidine kinase 10 (Hik10) and the soluble lytic transglycosylase Slt. On the reverse strand, the additional T falls within the predicted -10 element of the slr0534_as3 promoter. Instead of the high-scoring CATAAT,33 the motif is changed to ATTAAT. Hence, a modulation of slr0534_as3 expression compared with the reference is possible. In contrast to its designation, this cis-antisense RNA overlaps the 3' end of genes slr0533 and hik10 (due to an error in the annotation used as the reference). In microarray analyses, slr0534_as3 of strain ‘PCC-M’ was found to be moderately to highly expressed under four tested conditions. Compared with the accumulation of the hik10 mRNA, it appeared even stronger.33 A function for Hik10 has been found in the perception of salt stress or transduction of the signal.35 The slr0534_as3 transcript may play a silencing role with regard to hik10 under non-inducing conditions. Mutation of its promoter element may hence cause a physiological effect in the salt stress response.Two other SNPs (at positions 831 647 and 2 400 722; #7 and #24 in Table 1) could have an impact on the promoter strength or the regulation of the genes infA and glcP. For glcP, the initiation site of transcription was mapped to position 2 400 66633 and for infA to position 831 635 (unpublished). Thus, these two SNPs are located 12 and 56 nt upstream of the respective initiation site of transcription. In the case of the infA promoter, the transition replaces a nucleotide within the putative -10 element, changing it from TGTGAT to TATGAT, a much more typical motif for a -10 element in Synechocystis.33 The mutation 56 nt upstream of the initiation site of transcription of glcP might be functionally relevant as well. The gene product, a glucose transporter, is directly relevant for the physiological ability to use glucose; its gene expression is affected by mutation of the gene for the AbrB-type transcription factor Sll0822.36 The region at position -56 might well be part of the recognized sequence.3.4. Larger indels and plasmidsIn addition to this relatively large number of SNPs, only seven larger deletions were found on the chromosome and two plasmids. Compared with the reference, a deletion of 0.6 kb exists in the gene slr1753 (#4 in Table 1), which encodes, according to our data, a giant protein comprising 1549 amino acids that probably is transported to the cell surface. However, we found this deletion in our verification also in ‘GT-Kazusa’ and ‘GT-V’. Moreover, the deleted/inserted region consists of long series of DNA repeats (Fig. 1), an evidence for a possible assembly or annotation error in the original sequence analysis. Alignment of the possible indel region in gene slr1753. The sequence obtained in the verification experiment is aligned with that of the ‘GT-Kazusa’ reference. Two types of DNA repeats are indicated by the filled and non-filled lozenges.Alignment of the possible indel region in gene slr1753. The sequence obtained in the verification experiment is aligned with that of the ‘GT-Kazusa’ reference. Two types of DNA repeats are indicated by the filled and non-filled lozenges.Given the very scarce available information concerning biological functions of the plasmids in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803, it was interesting that all seven plasmids were detected during our analysis. Two, pCC5.2 and pCB2.4, were initially not found. However, as they were amplified easily by PCR, we re-inspected the unmapped sequencing reads, but still could not detect a single read matching these plasmids. This observation may relate to a lower copy number of these compared with the other plasmids, but this was not tested in the current study. Analysing the plasmid sequences, we observed a remarkable genetic stability. In addition to a single-base substitution in the plasmid pCA2.4 that might rather constitute an error in the reference sequence37 (see above) and a missing mobile element on the plasmid pSYSM, two mutations were observed, both in the plasmid pSYSA.Two major mutations affect the clustered regularly interspaced short palindrome repeats-CRISPR-associated proteins (CRISPR-Cas) system, located on the plasmid pSYSA. CRISPR-Cas systems provide in many archaea and bacteria an adaptive immunity against invading DNA.38–44 The plasmid pSYSA encodes the three independent systems CRISPR1, CRISPR2 and CRISPR3. A 2399-bp deletion encompassing the spacer-repeat regions 15–47 of CRISPR1 was detected in ‘PCC-M’ (#43), which also eliminated the relatively short genes ssr7018, ssl7019, ssl7020 and ssl7021, annotated within the spacer-repeat array of CRISPR1. However, the theoretical protein sequences of these gene products show no conservation at all and might not constitute real genes. Nevertheless, the deletion of spacer-repeat regions 15–47 of CRISPR1 is severe, since compared with the reference, it has eliminated two-thirds, 33 of its 49 spacer-repeat units. The sequence analysis suggests that the recombination events leading to the deletion of spacer-repeat regions 15–47 must have occurred within the direct repeats. Thus, this recombination is in agreement with previous observations that the downstream ends of the repeat clusters are conserved such that deletions and recombination events occur internally.45A very different type of deletion was noticed for the CRISPR2 system located on the same plasmid. In this case, 159 bp were deleted (event #44 in Table 1). These 159 deleted bases correspond to positions 71 499–71 657 in the reference. The deletion encompasses two repeats including the spacer 41 in between. It is very surprising that the recombination did not occur within the repeat sections but in the adjacent spacers 40 and 42, thus generating a new ‘hybrid’ spacer 40 at positions 69 082–69 111 in the pSYSA plasmid of ‘PCC-M’ (Fig. 2). As a result, spacers 40, 41 and 42 of the original sequence are missing and became replaced by this hybrid sequence. The vast majority of described deletions in the CRISPR system occur between the direct repeats.45 Non-homologous recombination between two different spacers is rare, the deletion observed here in CRISPR2 of the plasmid pSYSA is generating additional sequence diversity in the CRISPR system. Due to the two deletions in the plasmid pSYSA, we determined its total length as 100 749 bp, compared with 103 307 bp for the reference. Non-homologous recombination in the plasmid pSYSA affecting spacers 40, 41 and 42 of CRISPR2. As a result of the 159-bp deletion in ‘PCC-M’ compared with ‘GT-Kazusa’, a novel hybrid spacer 40 was generated. The direct repeats are presented as squares and the nucleotide positions in the ‘GT-Kazusa’ are given according to the GenBank file NC_005230.Non-homologous recombination in the plasmid pSYSA affecting spacers 40, 41 and 42 of CRISPR2. As a result of the 159-bp deletion in ‘PCC-M’ compared with ‘GT-Kazusa’, a novel hybrid spacer 40 was generated. The direct repeats are presented as squares and the nucleotide positions in the ‘GT-Kazusa’ are given according to the GenBank file NC_005230.3.5. Mobile elementsAs can be seen in Tables 1 and 2 (differences #12, 17, 40 and 45), the ‘PCC-M’ substrain lacks four insertion elements of the ISY203 type present in ‘GT-Kazusa’.7 These elements are ISY203b, e and g on the chromosome and ISY203j on the plasmid pSYSM. These four indels have the exact same size of 1183 bp, only one is 1185 bp.In the ‘GT-S’ substrain re-sequenced by Tajima et al.10 one of these four elements, ISY203e, is already present, placing this strain (in accordance with Ikeuchi and Tabata)8 before ‘GT-Kazusa’ in the strain history. The absence of ISY203b, e and g in ‘PCC-M’ is further shared with the strains ‘GT-I’, ‘PCC-N’ and ‘PCC-P’,9 whereas no statement is possible with regard to the possible presence of ISY203j on the plasmid pSYSM in the latter.With respect to the described mobile elements, ‘PCC-M’ appears as one of the least-derived substrains.4. Discussion4.1. Strain history‘PCC-M’ shows sequence differences in several genes compared with the reference sequence of ‘GT-Kazusa’ and also to the recently sequenced ‘GT-S’ strain. Kanesaki et al.9 concluded that 15 differences between the resequenced strains and the published GT-Kazusa sequence were annotation errors in the latter due to sequencing artefacts, a list to which we add two more putative errors in the database, differences #4 and #42 in Table 1. According to the proposed strain history in Ikeuchi and Tabata,8 the early division of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 into two branches occurred due to an insertion in spkA. Thus, our data suggest that the motile ‘PCC-M’ strain belongs to the motile PCC 6803 branch, whereas the non-motile ‘GT-Kazusa’, ‘GT-S’ and ‘GT-V’ strains are more closely related to each other and belong to the ATCC 27 184 branch. However, the 1-bp insertion in the pilC leading to ‘GT-Kazusa’ as described in the proposed strain history8 is not present in either ‘GT-S’ or ‘GT-V’, characterizing ‘GT-Kazusa’ as a more derived substrain.That ‘PCC-M’ belongs to the motile PCC 6803 branch is further reinforced by our finding of six SNPs specifically shared between the ‘PCC-M’ and the ‘PCC-N and PCC-P’ substrains (Tables 1 and 2).9 These six SNPs are in slr1865, in sll1951, encoding a haemolysin-like protein, in ssr1176, encoding a transposase and, interestingly, in genes encoding sensor and/or regulatory proteins (slr1983, slr0222 and slr0302) (Tables 1 and 2) and must already have been present in the progenitor strain to ‘PCC-M’, ‘PCC-N’ and ‘PCC-P’. Additional support comes from the analysis of two larger indels (#2 and #6 in Table 1). The preceding paper, Kanesaki et al.,9 described difficulties in finding indels between direct repeat sequences such as slr1084 and slr2031 by short read type re-sequencing data. Therefore, these two regions were analysed by PCR and Sanger sequencing in addition to the re-sequencing analysis. Indeed, the finding of indels between direct repeat sequences in genes slr1084 and slr2031 turned out as not been straightforward in our analysis as well. Compared with the reference, we found in both cases the additional sequences of 102 and 154 bp to be present in ‘PCC-M’. This result is relevant for lineage relationships among substrains. The additional 102 bp in gene slr1084 are shared between ‘PCC-M’ and the other substrains ‘PCC-P’, ‘PCC-N’ and ‘GT-I’. Therefore, this must be a deletion in the lineage leading to GT-Kazusa and GT-S. In contrast, the additional 154 bp within and upstream of gene slr2031 are shared between ‘PCC-M’, ‘PCC-P’ and ‘PCC-N’ and are absent from all studied GT substrains. These 154 bp comprise the conserved start codon of slr2031 and extend the gene by 29 codons compared with ‘GT-Kazusa’. Hence, the lack of these 154 bp in GT strains indicate a functionally adverse deletion there. In fact, the 154-bp deletion in GT substrains was noticed before,46 as well as the activity of slr2031 in the original Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 substrains.47 From these considerations, the tree shown in Fig. 3 can be derived. In this tree, ‘GT-Kazusa’ is displayed as the strain with the longest evolutionary distance from the original isolate, whereas the ‘PCC-M’ substrain belongs to the ‘PCC’ group of substrains and is probably close to the original characteristics. All strains belonging to the ‘PCC’ group of substrains exhibit twitching motility as was shown also for the original PCC strain deposited in the Pasteur Culture Collection6 with variations in the motility behaviour.48,49 Since ‘PCC-M’ shows motility and is tolerant to glucose, it appears physiologically as a sort of intermediate between the two major branches: the motile and GT branches, consistent with its characterization as being close to the original characteristics.

PCC 6803The analysis of genome sequences of cyanobacteria has had a large impact on photosynthesis, ecology and biotechnology research.50 The present re-sequencing project delivers the new and complete sequence of the Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 ‘PCC-M’, a substrain used in many laboratories and in several aspects close to the original isolate. Altogether, there are now chromosomal sequences for seven substrains of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 available: ‘PCC-M’ (this study); ‘PCC-P’ (positive phototaxis) and ‘PCC-N’ (negative phototaxis), both based on single colonies isolated from the PCC strain and designated according to their direction of phototactic movement;24 ‘GT-I’, the standard strain in Dr Ikeuchi's group;8 ‘YF’17 and ‘GT-S’,10 a current derivative of the original stock of Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 from which the chromosomal reference sequence for ‘GT-Kazusa’ was determined in 19962 and for the large plasmids in 2003,20 whereas the three small plasmids had been sequenced already before.37,51,524.3. Mutations potentially linked to phenotypeIt is likely that most of the identified differences between the sequenced substrains result from distinct differences in the cultivation conditions in the different laboratories that have selected for fixing one or the other mutation. That also implies that the majority of identified mutations are not silent but linked to a certain effect. Indeed, most mutations in coding regions are not silent as might be expected but lead to frameshifts, amino acid substitutions or the truncation of reading frames. Similarly, SNPs in non-coding regions are probably biologically meaningful, too. This idea received support here by linking three ‘PCC-M’-specific SNPs in IGRs to the promoter regions controlling the expression of two protein-coding and one antisense RNA.For all these reasons, it appears likely that several of the mutations specific to ‘PCC-M’ or shared with ‘PCC-P’ and ‘PCC-N’ may be related to the known phenotypes of these strains. For example, the truncation of sll1951 (haemolysin) and possible truncation of slr1753 (surface protein) may contribute to a stress-induced clumping phenotype. Several other mutations might cause alterations in glucose tolerance or phototactic behaviour of these substrains. Differences at other loci may affect the phage resistance, stress response or functions in the primary metabolism, potentially relevant for the synthesis of alkanes or the N and C metabolism. The absence of ISY203g in the sll1473–5 regions in PCC substrains leads to an intact photoreceptor that regulates the expression of an alternative phycobilisome linker gene.53 Regarding phenotypic differences among motile PCC substrains, it might be noteworthy that ‘PCC-M’, despite its general ability to be motile, is not phototactic towards blue light (see direct comparison of strains in Fig. 1 of Fiedler et al.48). Here, the SNP #39 in the sigF gene, known to be involved in the control of phototactic movement30 might be considered, as the resulting M231K substitution could influence the DNA–protein interaction of this group 3 sigma factor in a very subtle way. For sure, the subtle differences in genome sequences have to be considered when choosing a particular substrain for certain experiments and when comparing phenotypes of mutant lines from different laboratories with the wild-type strain.

IntroductionRecent advances in genomics have provided various opportunities to a number of crop species of significant agronomical importance for enhancing crop productivity. One of the foremost applications of genomics in breeding is the prediction of a phenotype from the genotype and the process is called genomics-assisted breeding (GAB).1 Several success stories of GAB are available in many temperate cereal crops2 and some legume species3 also. However, legume crops like pigeonpea (Cajanus cajan L. Millspaugh), which is grown in ~5 million hectares in the developing countries of Asia and Africa have remained untouched by GAB. This may be attributed mainly to two reasons: (i) paucity of genomic tools and (ii) narrow genetic diversity in the gene pool of the pigeonpea. Following 5 years of intensive research efforts and investment in genomics, however, a significant amount of genomic resources such as a large collection of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) or transcript reads,4–7 large-scale molecular markers including simple sequence repeats (SSRs),8,9 single-feature polymorphisms,10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)5–7 and diversity array technology (DArT)11,12 markers have been developed. Very recently, the draft genome sequence has also become available.13Identification of molecular markers for applying in a breeding programme requires the development of a genetic map and quantitative trait locus (QTL) analysis. In the case of pigeonpea, although a few genetic maps have been developed,9,12,14,15 the marker density in those maps is very low. A major challenge, therefore, before the pigeonpea community is the development of a saturated genetic map. In this context, SNP markers have attracted significant attention as these markers represent the most abundant class of polymorphisms in genomes and are amenable for high-throughput genotyping.3,16 In general, the implementation of SNPs for genetic studies involves a three-step process: (i) SNP discovery after aligning the ESTs, sequence reads generated by Sanger or next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies for different genotypes in a given species; (ii) validation of SNPs to distinguish DNA polymorphisms of actual allelic variants from those of other biological phenomenon, such as gene duplication events; i.e. paralogous or homeologous genes, as well as those of technical errors, primarily sequencing errors, in case SNPs have been identified using in silico approaches; (iii) SNP genotyping of germplasm collection or genetic/breeding populations. A wide range of molecular techniques suitable for pursuing the mentioned three steps have been available,17 each characterized by a distinct cost scale and throughput capacity, and utilizing different technology platforms. NGS technologies are bringing us the capacity to identify, at affordable cost, large numbers of SNPs for even non-model species. Similarly, the availability of a number of SNP genotyping platforms, in a high-throughput manner, is making SNP genotyping cost-effective.Depending on the sample size and number of SNPs to be analysed, medium- to high-throughput assay platforms such as BeadXpress and GoldenGate assays from Illumina Inc. with a varying set of multiplexes (96, 384, 768 or 1536 SNPs per assay) are available. Such platforms have been developed and used in several crop species such as barley,18 wheat,19 maize20 and oil seed rape,21 and legumes such as soybean,22 cowpea23 and pea.24 Furthermore, in some crops like maize, Infinium assays with the capacity of genotyping ~50 000 SNPs have become available.25 Such platforms, however, are cost-effective only when a minimum of 96, 384, 762, 1536 or thousands of SNPs are used with a large number of samples. In cases like marker-assisted selection where only a few markers are required for genotyping large-scale segregating populations, Illumina-based genotyping assays do not seem to be cost-effective. In such cases, the competitive allele-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (KASPar) assay from KBiosciences (www.kbioscience.co.uk) seems to be an effective marker assay. The KASPar genotyping assay is a competitive allele-specific PCR-based fluorescent SNP genotyping system. It is a user-friendly system that provides flexibility in the numbers of SNPs and genotypes to be used for assays. Details about this technology are available at http://www.kbioscience.co.uk/reagents/KASP.html. Because of the importance of KASPar assays in genotyping more samples with a few SNPs, they have been developed in wheat,26 common bean27 and chickpea.28With an objective to develop a flexible and cost-effective SNP genotyping platform in pigeonpea, this study reports the compilation of informative SNP data sets, development and characterization of KASPar assays, and development of an SNP-based genetic linkage map of pigeonpea and its use for comparative genomics with closely related legume species like soybean (Glycine max), cowpea (Vigna ungiculata), Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus.2. Materials and methods2.1. Mapping population and DNA isolationTwo Cajanus spp., one from cultivated pigeonpea (C. cajan) ICP 28 and the another accession from the wild relative of pigeonpea (C. scarabaeoides) ICPW 94, were used as crossing parents for the development of an F2 population of 167 individuals. Accordingly, a single plant of ICP 28 accession was used as a female parent and crossed with the pollen parent ICPW 94 plant and F1s were produced. All F1s were selfed under nylon bags and grown at Patancheru in southern India (17°N). A single F1 plant having the highest number of F2 seeds was selected to develop a mapping population of 167 F2 individuals. To characterize developed SNP markers, a set of 24 genotypes was utilized for screening the polymorphism (Supplementary Table S1). These genotypes represent parents of 14 mapping populations which are segregating for various agronomically important traits. Total DNA from the parents of different mapping populations and F2 lines derived from ICP 28 × ICPW 94 were isolated from two to three young leaves following the standard DNA isolation protocol as mentioned in the study of Cuc et al.29 The DNA quantity for each sample was assessed on 0.8% agarose gel.2.2. Identification of SNPsThe complete Illumina GA IIx data set was comprised 128.9 million, 36 bp short single-end reads from 12 genotypes (ICPL 87119, ICPL 87091, BSMR 736, TAT 10, ICP 7035, TTB 7, ICPL 332, ICPL 20096, ICPB 2049, ICPL 99050, ICP 28 and ICPW 94; Table 1). Identification of SNPs from assembled data was carried out using the Alpheus software system.30 SNPs were identified on the basis of alignment of sequence reads generated from each of the counter genotypes against the reference assembly, i.e. pigeonpea transcriptome assembly which was developed by assembling four different sequence data sets7 and allowing not more than two mismatches. Based on the alignment results, variants at a particular nucleotide position were identified. Significant variants were selected based on two criteria: (i) the allele frequency between two genotypes >0.8 (the number of a specific allele divided by the number of all alleles for the specific SNP between two genotypes should be higher than 80%) and (ii) the number of tags aligned to the reference >5.

KASPar genotyping assayFor each putative SNP, the criteria used for the selection of high-quality SNPs for KBioscience competitive allele-specific PCR (KASPar) assay31 included: (i) an SNP flanked by at least 50 bases on either side; (ii) frequency difference between the two genotypes =5; (iii) read depth =5. For each SNP, two allele-specific forward primers and one common reverse primer were designed. By using these primers, KASPar assays were performed in a final reaction volume of 5 µL containing 1× KASP reaction mix (KBioscience, Hoddesdon, UK), 0.07 µL of assay mix (12 µM each allele-specific forward primer and 30 µM reverse primer) and 10–20 ng of genomic DNA. The Gene Pro Thermal cycler (Bioer Technology, Hangzhou, China) was used for the following cycling conditions: 15 min at 94°C; 10 touchdown cycles of 20 s at 94°C and 60 s at 65–57°C (the annealing temperature for each cycle being reduced by 0.8°C per cycle); and 26–35 cycles of 20 s at 94°C and 60 s at 57°C. Fluorescence detection of the reactions was performed using an Omega Fluorostar scanner (BMG LABTECH GmbH, Offenburg, Germany) and the data were analysed using the KlusterCaller 1.1 software (KBioscience). Details on the KASPar principle, amplification of targeted region, fluorescence detection and allele calling are available at http://www.kbioscience.co.uk/reagents/KASP_manual.pdf. The polymorphism information content (PIC) values for developed markers across 24 genotypes (Supplementary Table S1) were calculated by using the PowerMarker software (http://statgen.ncsu.edu/powermarker/).2.4. Linkage mappingGenotyping data generated using KASPar assays on 167 F2 individuals of an ICP 28 × ICPW 94 population were analysed for linkage analysis using JoinMap version 4.0 with ‘regression mapping algorithm’.32 Prior to linkage analysis, marker segregation data were subjected to the goodness-of-fit test (<U+03C7>2) to assess deviations from the expected Mendelian segregation ratio of 1:2:1 at a 5% level of significance. Map calculations were performed at a logarithm (base 10) of odds (LOD) value of 5.0, recombination frequency =0.40 and <U+03C7>2 jump threshold for removal of loci = 5. A Kosambi map function was used to convert the recombination frequency into cM distances33 and the third round was set to allow the mapping of an optimum number of loci in the genetic map. Mean <U+03C7>2 contributions or average contributions to the goodness of fit of each locus were also checked to determine the best fitting position for markers in genetic maps. The markers showing negative map distances or a large jump in mean <U+03C7>2 values were subsequently discarded. The graphical maps of the linkage groups (LGs) were constructed by using MapChart version 2.2.342.5. Comparative genome analysisDNA sequences for corresponding mapped SNP markers were used for comparative analysis with the genetic map of cowpea23 and the genome assemblies of soybean (ftp://ftp.jgi-psf.org/pub/JGI_data/phytozome/v7.0/Gmax/assembly), M. truncatula (http://www.medicagohapmap.org/downloads.php) and L. japonicus (ftp://ftp.kazusa.or.jp/pub/lotus/lotus_r2.5/pseudomolecule). Vmatch35 was used to identify reciprocal best matches between the pigeonpea sequences and other legume sequences. Hits matching a minimum of 70% sequence identity were retained for the comparative study. Identification of homologous blocks was performed using i-ADHoRe v2.1.36 For the purpose of developing Circos images, cM distances on the pigeonpea LGs were scaled up by a factor of 250 000 to match similar bp lengths of the chromosomes of other legumes' genomes. Synteny blocks were visualized by using Circos26.37 Scales along the outer edges of the pigeonpea and cowpea LGs show actual cM distances, whereas those along the outer edges of the soybean, Medicago and Lotus chromosomes are in Mb.3. Results3.1. Development of a mapping populationAlthough a set of 72 F2 plants were available from an earlier cross (C. cajan ICP 28 × C. scarabaeoides ICPW 94) that were used to develop an SSR-based genetic map,9 a new cross with the same accessions was made to develop a bigger population (167 F2 lines) for developing a high-resolution genetic map.3.2. Assembly of informative SNPsWith a goal of increasing the cost-effective and high-throughput genetic marker repertoire in pigeonpea, the following two different sequence resources were surveyed for the presence of SNPs: (i) Illumina GA IIx transcript sequence data and (ii) tentative orthologous genes (TOGs) of closely related legumes.For the identification of SNPs, 128.9 million Illumina reads of 12 different genotypes (ICPL 87119, ICPL 87091, BSMR 736, TAT 10, ICP 7035, TTB 7, ICPL 332, ICPL 20096, ICPB 2049, ICPL 99050, ICP 28 and ICPW 94) were aligned against the transcriptome assembly (CcTA v2).7 The CcTA v2 comprised 21 434 transcriptome assembly contigs (TACs) developed from transcriptome data sets from 21 pigeonpea genotypes (128.9 million Illumina GA IIx reads from 12 genotypes, 2.19 million FLX/454 reads from 3 genotypes and 18 353 Sanger ESTs from 6 genotypes).7 Variants were identified using the ‘Alpheus’ program30 by comparing the sequence tags from two genotypes of a given mapping population combination. In total, a set of 17 113 SNPs in 10 159 unique sequences were identified between six crosses (Table 1). The number of SNPs in an individual cross ranged from 1256 (TTB 7 × ICPL 7035) to 7488 (ICPL 87119 × ICPL 87091) (Table 1). However, only six SNPs were found common across three populations (ICPL 20096 × ICPL 332, TTB 7 × ICPL 7035 and BSMR 736 × TAT 10). For the ICP 28 and ICPW 94 combination, a total of 1910 SNPs were identified in 1352 TACs. By considering only one SNP per TAC (gene) and primer designing criteria of KASPar assays, 1167 SNPs were further selected.After sequencing ICP 28 and ICPW 94 accessions with 670 TOGs, a set of 752 SNPs were identified and used in designing the GoldenGate assay in a separate study.38 From these 752 SNPs, a total of 660 SNPs satisfied the required primer designing criteria for KASPar assays.After combining the above-mentioned data sets, a non-redundant set of 1827 SNPs (1167 from Illumina GA IIx transcript data, referred as GAIIx-SNPs and 660 TOG-SNPs) was complied.3.3. Development and validation of KASPar assaysA total of 1827 non-redundant SNPs were used for the development of KASPar assays (Supplementary Table S2). However, successful assays could be developed for 1616 SNPs (88.4%) with scorable allele calls. These marker assays have been referred to as PKAMs (pigeonpea KASPar assay markers). All 1616 PKAMs were screened on 24 pigeonpea genotypes, including 23 cultivated and one wild-type ICPW 94, representing parents of 14 mapping populations (Supplementary Table S1), further defined a subset of 1154 polymorphic markers (77.4%). Among these polymorphic PKAMs, 1043 were polymorphic exclusively in wild species. Data obtained from 24 genotypes were used to calculate the PIC value of each PKAM marker, and PIC values ranged from 0.04 to 0.38 with an average of 0.09 (Supplementary Table S2). In terms of the parental polymorphism of different mapping populations, polymorphism rates varied considerably, depending on the crossing parental lines under comparison, from a low of 14 polymorphic PKAMs (ICP 8863 × ICPL 20097) to a high of 1094 polymorphic PKAMs (ICP 28 × ICPW 94) (Supplementary Table S1).3.4. SNP-based genetic mapWith a goal of developing an SNP-based genetic map in pigeonpea, genotyping data were obtained on 167 progenies for all the 1094 polymorphic PKAMs. However, high-quality data obtained for 1008 PKAMs were considered for further analysis. Genotyping data obtained for all 1008 PKAMs were tested for the Mendelian/non-Mendelian segregation pattern. As a result, the 33 PKAMs showing non-Mendelian inheritance were removed from further analysis. Subsequently, genotyping data for 975 PKAMs (470 PKAMs based on GAIIx-SNPs and 505 PKAMs from TOG-SNPs) were used for linkage analysis, with JoinMap4.0 used to construct the genetic linkage map.32In summary, 11 LGs were generated using an LOD threshold value of 5.0, which is in agreement with the haploid chromosome number (11) in pigeonpea. A total of 55 PKAMs that failed to be assigned to these 11 LGs were not incorporated in further analyses. While assigning the order of PKAMs in different individual LGs, map positions could not be assigned for 45 PKAMs. As a result, the developed genetic map contains 875 (444 GAIIx-SNP and 431 TOG-SNP) loci on 11 LGs (Supplementary Fig. S1), ranging from 25.7 cM (CcLG05) to 124.25 cM (CcLG11) in length, and a total map length of 967.03 cM (Supplementary Table S3). The number of markers per LG ranges from 25 (CcLG05) to 134 (CcLG02), with an average of 79.54 (Table 2 and Supplementary Fig. S1). The highest marker density with an inter-marker distance of 0.84 cM was observed on CcLG02, while CcLG09 had the lowest marker density with average marker spacing 1.79 cM. Most of the spaces between two markers were smaller than 20 cM on the genetic linkage map. However, there were only two spaces where the distances between markers were large, i.e. 23.56 cM between PKAM0211 and PKAM0417 on CcLG02 and 28.85 cM between PKAM0671 and PKAM0543 on CcLG06. Features of SNP-based and integrated pigeonpea genetic mapsFeatures of SNP-based and integrated pigeonpea genetic maps3.5. Integrated genetic mapWith an objective to provide anchor points to integrate an SSR-based genetic linkage map with the SNP-based genetic linkage map, the newly developed mapping population (ICP 28 × ICPW 94) was also genotyped with targeted SSRs (2–5) from each LG of the SSR-based genetic linkage map previously developed by Bohra et al.9 In this context, genotyping data generated for a total of 35 SSRs. All the 35 SSRs were mapped onto 11 LGs (CcLG01–CcLG11). The number of SSR markers per LG varied from two (CcLG02, CcLG08, CcLG10 and CcLG11) to five (CcLG03 and CcLG04) (Table 2). After integration of the SSR markers, the total distance of the integrated genetic linkage map increased by 29.18 cM (Fig. 1). Subsequently, the integrated genetic map was compared with the SSR-based genetic linkage map and the marker order was consistent between similar LGs. However, in the case of CcLG03, out of five common markers, two markers, namely CcM1593 and CcM2045, had different positions. All pairwise comparisons between the integrated LGs and SSR-based LGs have been shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. As expected, the marker order and distances were well conserved between the integrated genetic map and the SNP-based genetic map. An integrated genetic map of pigeonpea. This genetic map is developed on the F2 mapping population derived from ICP 28 × ICPW 94. The map comprises 910 loci (875 PKAMs and 35 SSRs) in which 444 PKAMs were developed based on GAIIx-SNPs, shown in red; 431 PKAMs were developed based on TOGs-SNPs, shown in green, and 35 SSRs previously mapped by Bohra et al.9 shown in black.An integrated genetic map of pigeonpea.

Genome relationships of pigeonpea with closely related legume speciesFor comparative genome analysis and to identify conserved synteny between genomes of pigeonpea and other related legume species, we combined both the genetic map position information for pigeonpea loci and genome sequence information of closely related species of different clades. A set of 875 mapped loci for which both genetic map positions and sequence information were available (Supplementary Table S3) was compared with the genome assemblies of soybean (Glyma1), Medicago (Mt 3.5) and Lotus (Lj 2.5 pseudomolecules) and with the transcript-specific genetic map of cowpea.23 In the comparison of pigeonpea with soybean, the highest percentage of the sequence similarity was identified. As expected, each pigeonpea LG shows extensive synteny with two or more chromosomes in soybean (Fig. 2a), probably due to the independent duplication event in the soybean genome.39 A total of 687 pigeonpea unique loci matched with 2480 soybean sequence stretches distributed on different chromosomes of soybean (Glyma1 assembly; Table 3). Maximum similarity was identified between CcLG04 with Gm13 followed by CcLG02 with Gm10, CcLG03 with Gm06 and Gm04, CcLG03 with Gm06, CcLG06 with Gm01, CcLG10 with Gm15, CcLG07 with Gm18, CcLG08 with Gm15, CcLG11 with Gm17, CcLG01 with Gm18, CcLG09 with Gm08 and CcLG05 with Gm08.

Only 57 unique pigeonpea loci showed synteny with 62 loci on the  cowpea map (Fig. 2b, Supplementary Table S4). In the case of pigeonpea and Medicago, 228 unique pigeonpea loci showed significant matches with 349 genomic regions on the Medicago chromosome (Fig. 2c, Supplementary Table S5). A total of 20 pigeonpea loci from CaLG02 showed similarity to MtChr01 genomic regions. A similar number of loci from CcLG03 showed similarity to MtChr03 genomic regions. CcLG04 showed almost equal similarity to MtChr04 (21) and MtChr05 (18). Similarly, loci from CcLG07 showed maximum matches to MtChr07 followed by CcLG08 with MtChr02, CcLG05 with MtChr08, CcLG06 with MtChr05 and CcLG11 with MtChr04. In the comparison of pigeonpea with Lotus, 216 pigeonpea unique loci matched with 303 different genomic regions on the Lotus chromosomes (Fig. 2d, Supplementary Table S6). In brief, each LG of pigeonpea showed considerable synteny with one or more chromosomes of Medicago and Lotus. The distribution of similarity hits across eight pigeonpea LGs was varied from 2 (CcLG05) to 9 (CcLG09) while comparing with cowpea, from 14 (CcLG09) to 55 (CcLG04) with Medicago and from 18 (CcLG01) to 74 (CcL03) with Lotus.4. DiscussionThe current availability of more than 3000 PCR-based markers in pigeonpea8,9 could not provide high or significant marker density in any of the populations to be adequate to allow a thorough scan of the genome for QTL discovery, association analysis, map-based cloning and anchoring of the genome sequence with the genetic map. This can be attributed to the low level of polymorphism in Cajanus spp. as well as the small number of lines in the mapping populations used for developing the genetic maps. To overcome the above-mentioned problems to some extent, a new mapping population with 167 F2 lines, compared with 72 lines used in the map of Bohra et al.9 , was developed and used for developing the genetic map. Furthermore, SNP markers were targeted for developing the cost-effective genotyping platform and developing the genetic map. As the SNP markers were derived from genes, the comparison of the SNP-based genetic map of pigeonpea with the genome sequence assemblies of soybean, Medicago and Lotus and the transcript map of cowpea provided the genome relationship of pigeonpea with the genomes of these legumes.When compared with the other marker systems, SNP markers are unique with regard to their amenability to high-throughput and low-cost (per data point) genotyping platforms.17 In the case of pigeonpea, a total of 17 113 SNPs were discovered after comparing the transcript sequence reads from 12 parental lines of six different mapping populations with the transcriptome and/or genome sequence of pigeonpea.6,13 To prove the usefulness of these predicted polymorphisms for practical plant breeding applications, validation of these SNPs is required. For this purpose, a number of SNP genotyping platforms such as GoldenGate, Infinium and KASPar assays are available. However, in this study, due to its cost- effective and flexible nature, the KASPar assay was developed for 1616 SNPs. KASPar assays can be flexibly used to validate any number of SNP markers on a desired range of accessions, unlike many other SNP genotyping platforms such as GoldenGate or Infinium assay, to produce a sufficient number of polymorphic markers in a given population to obtain a better coverage. In the published literature, three reports are available on the development of KASPar assays in crop plants. For instance, in the case of wheat, KASPar assays were developed for 1114 SNPs and validated on 23 wheat varieties and also used for integrating SNP markers into the genetic map of wheat.26 In the case of common bean, KASpar assays have been developed for 94 SNPs and used for analysing genetic diversity in 70 accessions.27 Very recently, Hiremath et al.28 developed KASpar assays for 2005 SNPs in chickpea and used these for genetic diversity analysis and genetic mapping in chickpea and comparative mapping in legumes. A comparison of genotyping ~100 chickpea lines with ~500 SNPs on GoldenGate and KASPar assays shows the superiority of KASPar assays over GoldenGate assays in terms of cost as well as time used. In summary, all these three studies underline the importance of KASPar assays for SNP genotyping on a large scale for genetics and breeding applications. In the present study, though 1827 SNPs were attempted for conversion into KASPar assays, only 1616 (88.4%) markers could be successfully converted. The failure of the remaining SNP markers (11.6%) to be validated is likely due to the presence of paralogous sequences, incorrect primer designing and/or the need to optimize PCR conditions. This conversion rate is higher than that of the other KASPar studies on wheat (67%)26 and chickpea (80.6%).28 This rate of conversion from selected SNPs to functional KASPar assays could probably be increased with optimization of primer designing and amplification conditions. However, we have made no attempt to optimize the failed assays. For ease of use, developed KASPar assay-based markers were designated as PKAMs.Screening of a new set of SNP markers (KASPar assays) on a set of 24 diverse pigeonpea genotypes representing the parents of 14 mapping populations segregating for various economically important traits provides readily available polymorphic markers for developing genetic maps and undertaking trait mapping in the respective mapping populations. In fact, these crossing combinations were selected based on diversity revealed through trait phenotyping and SSR profiling data.40 Although KASPar assays were developed for SNPs identified to be polymorphic between ICP 28 and ICPW 94, only 71.4% (1154) markers showed polymorphism in the tested genotypes. The remaining 28.6% (462) markers did not show polymorphism at all, including between the ICP 28 and ICPW 94 genotypes, indicating incorrect prediction. Out of 462 monomorphic markers, 379 (82.1%) markers were identified based on the Illumina GA IIx transcript sequence data, and the remaining 83 (17.9%) SNPs were identified based on allele re-sequencing of TOGs. This emphasizes the need of stringent selection criteria and the validation of in silico identified SNPs via allele re-sequencing.28 In brief, this study provides a list of polymorphic markers for different mapping populations that segregate for a number of important traits like Fusarium wilt, sterility mosaic disease and fertility restoration etc. that are important for pigeonpea improvement. The number of polymorphic markers identified in this study in intra-specific mapping populations was less (up to 55 markers in a given cross; Supplementary Table S1); however, these polymorphic markers would be helpful in enriching the recently developed SSR-based genetic linkage maps of intra-specific mapping populations.14The present study reports a comprehensive genetic map comprising 875 loci by using 167 F2 individuals derived from ICP 28 × ICPW 94. Initial construction of a skeletal map with un-skewed markers and followed by the integration of distorted markers helped in minimizing the possibility for spurious assignments of markers.9 Eight hundred and seventy-five marker loci were mapped on 11 LGs corresponding to the 11 chromosome pairs of the pigeonpea genome. The total length of the map was 967.03 cM and the average marker spacing was 1.11 cM. The current pigeonpea linkage map is a considerable improvement over the previous pigeonpea genetic linkage maps using SSR and DArT markers.9,12 The marker density in the current map is almost three times higher than that in the previous maps. This higher marker density would be useful in determining double recombinants affecting a single marker. SNP genotyping using KASPar assays resulted in a much lower genotyping error rate than that obtained with markers like SSRs. In addition, SNP markers showing null alleles or an excess number of double recombinants were removed from the analyses. Owing to this careful error checking, the current map shows an increase in the total marker density compared with the previous maps developed by using SSR and DArT markers.9,12 However, we have noticed that in two LGs (i.e. CcLG02 and CcLG06), a few marker spaces were larger than 20 cM. Therefore, it is required to develop more markers and fill the gaps in the large marker space to increase the density of the linkage map. Earlier to this map, Bohra et al.9 developed an SSR marker-based map comprising 239 loci by using 72 F2 lines derived from ICP 28 × ICPW 94. To develop a consensus map, the newly developed mapping population (ICP 28 × ICPW 94) was also genotyped with targeted SSRs and an integrated genetic linkage map covering 996.21 cM was constructed. With the help of a recently available pigeonpea draft genome sequence,13 efforts are underway to develop a large number of SSR and SNP markers. Therefore, this map should serve as a ‘reference map’ for other future genetic maps of pigeonpea. Moreover, as the SNP markers are derived from the transcriptome sequences, these markers and the map would be very useful for linking the future genetic maps and the genome sequence of pigeonpea. In addition to the polymorphic markers in parental combinations of intra-specific mapping populations, most of the mapped PKAM markers in the inter-specific mapping population were monomorphic in cultivated parental lines. However, these mapped loci have provided a resource that can be used for conducting association analysis and linkage disequilibrium estimation in pigeonpea germplasm.The recent development of a large data set of crop genomic sequences has aided in global gene predictions as well as in the identification of sequences important in gene regulation. In addition, comparative sequence analysis of crops is poised to contribute to the exploration of the genetic bases for differences and similarities among species. We are likely at last to understand the genetic explanation of how species have adapted to perform their shared or unique biological functions. Analysis of the sequences containing mapped SNPs onto pigeonpea genetic maps against two model legume species (Lotus and Medicago) and two crop legume species (soybean and cowpea) showed maximum similarity to soybean sequences (2480 soybean sequences). In general, markers mapped on one LG hit sequences from several chromosomes of soybean, suggesting the occurrence of chromosomal rearrangement in both the genomes. As soybean has under gone recent complete genome duplication,39 almost all the pigeonpea sequences have shown two to three different hits with soybean genome sequences. It also proves the taxonomical classification of pigeonpea and soybean, which lie in close proximity under subfamily Papilionoideae.41 With the model legume species 39.8% (Medicago) and 34.6% (Lotus) sequence similarities were identified whereas in the case of cowpea, 7.1% pigeonpea sequences could provide similarity results. This may be attributed to the fact that for sequence similarity analysis with pigeonpea sequences, genome assemblies of soybean, Medicago and Lotus were used, and during the time of analysis, genome sequence information was not available for cowpea; hence, the analysis was done by comparing with the high-density linkage map developed by Muchero et al.23 We discovered that synteny blocks in each of the 11 pigeonpea LGs were syntenic to their counterparts of the chromosomes of four legumes, implying certain colinearity for the syntenic chromosome/linkage pairs. The conserved sequences identified among five legumes (pigeonpea, soybean, cowpea, Medicago and Lotus) and the data from the comparative genome analysis should facilitate studies on genome evolution and analysis of the structural genome, but more importantly should facilitate the functional inference of genes in pigeonpea. The determination of gene functions is difficult in non-model species including pigeonpea; thus, functional genome analysis will have to rely heavily on the establishment of orthologies from model species.In summary, this study provides an extensive resource of SNPs, their conversion in cost-effective KASPar assays and their application in constructing a dense genetic map in pigeonpea and in similarity analysis across five legumes. The developed genetic map is the most comprehensive genetic map for pigeonpea based on a single mapping population. Through mapped SNPs, we have identified complex syntenic relationships between soybean and pigeonpea by comparative genomics analysis. We consider that it will be possible for pigeonpea breeders to attain one of their most important goals, to rapidly and economically genotype thousands of accessions with a large and flexible number of markers. Although this is the first reported sizeable scale SNP mapping effort in pigeonpea, a larger number of informative SNPs mapped at minimum intervals will be necessary for broader applications. The extensive genomics resources developed by the whole-genome sequencing of pigeonpea, coupled to future re-sequencing multiple breeding lines, promise to considerably increase the number of informative SNPs, permitting exceptional levels of precision genetic analysis in pigeonpea breeding.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe authors are thankful to CGIAR Generation Challenge Programme for SP2 commissioned project (G4008.47) and Theme Leader Discretionary Funds for support in carrying out this study.Thanks are also due to Anuja Dubey, Pavana Hiremath, Sarwar Azam, A Bhanuprakash, Trushar Shah and Poornima Reddy for their help in some analysis and useful discussions while preparing the manuscript.Supplementary data"

IntroductionAmong several transcription factor families that present exclusively in eukaryotes, the basic leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor family is one of the largest and most diverse families. bZIP transcription factors are named according to their common feature, bZIP domain, which is ~60–80 amino acids in length and consists of a basic region and a Leu zipper.1 The basic region of around 18 amino acid residues with an invariant motif N-x7-R/K-x9 is responsible for nuclear localization and DNA binding, whereas the following Leu zipper motif made up of several heptad repeats of Leu or other bulky hydrophobic amino acids, such as Ile, Val, Phe or Met, is less conserved and mediates the homo- and/or heterodimerization of bZIP proteins. Plant bZIP proteins present a relaxed binding specificity for DNA sequence motifs containing an ACGT core, and preferentially bind to the G-box (CACGTG), C-box (GACGTC) and A-box (TACGTA).2 At the time of DNA binding, the N-terminal half of the basic region inserts into the major groove of double-stranded DNA and the C-terminal half of the Leu zipper mediates dimerization to form a superimposed coiled-coil structure.3,4Members of the bZIP transcription factor family have been identified or predicted in many eukaryotic genomes. It has been reported that 17 bZIP genes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, 31 in Caenorhabditis elegans, 27 in Drosophila,5 56 in humans,6 75 in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana),7 89 in rice (Oryza sativa),8 92 in Sorghum9 and 131 in soybean (Glycine max).10 In spite of this, only a small part of bZIP transcription factors have been functionally validated in plants. Data show that plant bZIP proteins participate in the differentiation of many organs and tissues, embryogenesis, seed maturation, floral transition and initiation, and vascular development. On the other hand, bZIP proteins are involved in signalling and responses to abiotic/biotic stimuli, including ABA signalling, osmotic, hypoxia, drought, high salinity and cold stresses, and pathogen defence. Available information exhibits that some bZIPs also respond to light irradiation and are involved in photomorphism.Zea mays (hereafter called maize) is a major cereal crop which is grown for food, feed, fibre and fuel, and also an important model system for basic biological researches.11,12 The maize genome has been completely sequenced in 2009 using the B73 inbred line as a genome donor.13 This provides us a good opportunity to further our research on maize and also enhance our understanding of its grass relatives such as sorghum, wheat and rice. In previous studies, only 12 maize bZIP transcription factors have been isolated and functionally characterized. Among these, the annotation of Opaque-2 (O2) is the most clear; it controls the transcription of a-zein, b-32 and ß-prolamin genes and regulates protein accumulation, amino acid and sugar metabolism in maize seeds.14–18 OHP1 and OHP2, mEmBP-1a and mEmBP-1b are also possible zein regulatory proteins that can bind to the O2 box from the 22-kDa zein gene promoter as a homodimer, while OHP1 and OHP2 can also bind as a heterodimeric complex with the O2 target site.19,20 Delayed flowering1 mediates floral transition at the shoot apex serving the same role as liguleless2 (lg2).21–23 Genetic analysis indicates that lg1 and lg2 are uniquely necessary for ligule and auricle development and play different roles in the ligule–auricle induction mechanism.24Mlip15 is a low temperature-induced gene, its transcript abundance is also strongly increased under salt stress and exogenous abscisic acid treatment, signifying a stress response role of this bZIP member.25 Octopine synthase element-binding factor-1 is expected to have putative roles in one or more aspects of leaf development.26 GBF1 is assumed to be involved in the activation of Adh1, which is a hypoxia-responsive protein.27 Two other ocs-element binding proteins, called OBF3.1 and OBF3.2, sharing 80% amino acid identity with the wheat HBP1b protein, have unknown functions. It is clear that to perform a comprehensive functional exploration for this gene family is a very urgent requirement.282. Methods2.1. Identification of maize bZIP transcription factorsTo identify all the putative bZIP proteins in the maize genome, we performed both local BLAST and hidden Markov model profile searches using the maize proteome sequence (ZmB73_5b_FGS_translations.fasta.gz) from the Maize Genome Sequence Project (http://ftp.maizesequence.org/current/filtered-set/) as a database and the known bZIP protein sequences from maize, rice and Arabidopsis as a query. The E-value was set to 1. Then these proteins were subjected to the National Center of Biotechnology Information (NCBI) CD search (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Structure/cdd/wrpsb.cgi), SMART (http://smart.embl-heidelberg.de/) and Pfam (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/) databases to ensure the presence of the bZIP domain. After removing the repeat and incomplete sequences manually, 170 proteins remained were named ZmbZIP transcription factors. The putative orthologs from Arabidopsis and rice were assigned to corresponding ZmbZIP proteins with the E-value below 1E-10, which were extracted by a BLASTP search from NCBI.2.2. Phylogenetic reconstructionAll of the phylogenetic trees in this article were reconstructed by the maximum likelihood method using the PhyMl 3.0 software29 with the best model selected by the Akaike information criterion implemented in ProtTest 3.0.30 Bootstrap values from 100 replicates are indicated at each node. The bZIP protein sequences of Arabidopsis (A. thaliana) and rice (O. sativa) were downloaded from the TAIR (http://www.arabidopsis.org/) and TIGR (http://rice.plantbiology.msu.edu/) databases, respectively. Then, the bZIP domain sequences of maize, Arabidopsis and rice, totally 333 sequences were loaded into PhyMl with the model JTT + G. In the same way, the phylogenetic trees generated based on the sequences of the maize bZIP domain, basic and hinge region and leucine zipper defined from the first leucine were best fitted to the model JTT + G + F, LG + G and JTT + I + G + F, respectively. Then the trees were visualized by iTOL.312.3. Identification of additional conserved motifsTo identify the additional conserved motifs outside the bZIP domain of ZmbZIP transcription factors, we sent 170 ZmbZIP protein sequences into Multiple Em (Expectation Maximization) for the Motif Elicitation tool (MEME version 4.8.1, http://meme.sdsc.edu/meme/cgi-bin/meme.cgi). The limits of minimum width, maximum width and maximum number of motifs were specified as 10, 50 and 50, respectively, since it excludes the bZIP domain which usually possesses 60–80 amino acids in length. Thirty motifs were finally confirmed because of their low E-value (<E-48). The motifs were numbered according to their order displayed in MEME and were considered as group-specific signatures for their presence of high frequency in the given groups.2.4. Gene structure and conserved intron splicing site analysisTo define the actual intron–exon arrangements of all the ZmbZIP genes, both gene sequences and corresponding coding sequences were needed and loaded into the Gene Structure Display Server (http://gsds.cbi.pku.edu.cn/). For a better visualization and comparison, the 5' UTR sequences were removed beforehand. The positions of the bZIP domain were retrieved with PAL2NAL (http://www.bork.embl.de/pal2nal/) by converting a multiple sequence alignment of domain sequences and the corresponding gene sequences into a codon alignment, and then marked in red in the Supplementary Fig. S3.2.5. Chromosomal localization of genes and detection of duplication eventsEach of the ZmbZIP genes was located on maize chromosomes using the GenomePixelizer software (http://www.atgc.org/GenomePixelizer/), which was designed to help visualize the relationships between duplicated genes in chromosomes. We adopted a group-specific colour strategy to mark each gene for better visualization and recognition.We adopted the definition that two or more ZmbZIP genes intervened by less than eight non-bZIP genes were considered as a gene cluster. The DAGchainer (http://dagchainer.sourceforge.net/) and the GenoPixelizer 2D plotter (http://www.atgc.org/GenoPix_2D_Plotter/) were used to find the duplicated gene pairs which are located in duplicated chromosomal segments, and SyMap (http://www.agcol.arizona.edu/software/symap/), which was developed to compute synteny blocks in a sequenced genome, was applied to discover duplicated regions and analyse larger-scale synteny blocks in maize.2.6. Construction of a three-dimensional structureThe surface mapping of the evolutionary conservation at each amino acid site of ZmbZIP14 (Fig. 2A) generated by Chimera 1.5.332 was based on the rest of the 169 ZmbZIP protein sequences to show the conserved regions across this transcription factor family. The colour bar shows the gradient of conservation from low to high. The most conserved amino acid residues were labelled. The superposition structure of four crystal structures of bZIP domains (Fig. 2B) were obtained from PDB accession number 1T2K (Homo sapiens, pink), 1DH3 (Mus musculus, green), 1YSA (S. cerevisiae, blue) and 2OQQ (A. thaliana, yellow), which were the most hits of ZmbZIP proteins by homologous modelling. The potential map was generated by Pymol, and the colour bar represents distribution of potential from negative (red) to positive (blue) values.2.7. Gene expression analysisTo gain an insight into the family-wide expression profile and obtain the genes with highly significant differential expression, microarray-based data analyses of both development and stress responses were performed. To analyse the spatial and temporal expression patterns of ZmbZIP genes during development, transcriptome data of the genome-wide gene expression atlas of maize inbred line B73 made by the NimbleGen microarrary technology was downloaded from Plexdb (ZM37). Gene expression data from the Affymetrix GeneChip array of drought stress as well as the data during four kinds of fungal infection were downloaded from GEO with accession numbers GSE16567, GSE10023, GSE31188, GSE19501 and GSE29747, respectively. All of these microarray data were imported into R and Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/) for expression analyses. The packages Limma and affy were applied to data processing. Then, the gplots package was used to make the heatmaps.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Identification and nomenclature of the maize bZIP transcription factor familyIn this paper, 170 proteins were confirmed as maize bZIP transcription factors which were encoded by 125 bZIP genes. Each maize bZIP gene was assigned a unique identifier from ZmbZIP1 to 125 as proposed by Jakoby et al.7 The nomenclature was based on the exact position of these genes on maize chromosomes 1–10 and from top to bottom. For the distinct transcripts encoded by the same gene locus share the same gene number with an additional decimal part, such as point 1 or 2 and so forth. These orthologous bZIP proteins in Arabidopsis and rice are identified by the BLASTP search with an E-value of <1E-10. All of the related information on ZmbZIP transcription factors are listed in the Supplementary Table S1.3.2. Phylogenetic analysis and classification of the ZmbZIP transcription factor familyTo analyse the phylogenetic relationship of bZIP transcription factors among maize, rice and Arabidopsis, 170 sequences from maize, 89 sequences from rice and 74 sequences from Arabidopsis, 333 sequences in total, were analysed (Supplementary Fig. S1). It was notable to see that the phylogenetic tree can be subdivided into 11 clades except some ambiguous branches, and the grouping in maize complies with the classification of Arabidopsis, whereas in rice, they are categorized into 11 groups I–XI according to the DNA-binding specificity. Although the phylogenetic tree of the three plant species has some divergences against the classification of OsbZIP proteins because certain members of groups III, IV and VI were separated from their clusters which has also been observed by Nijhawan et al.8 The interspecies clustering indicates a parallel evolution of bZIP transcription factors in three plants and the homologous bZIP proteins which develop similar functions can be observed.33 Here, we integrate the features of both phylogenetic relationship among three plants and the basic and hinge regions to classify 170 ZmbZIP proteins into 11 groups and name the groups following Arabidopsis. The two proteins with the nearest evolutionary distance to the two unclassified AtbZIP62 and AtbZIP72 and OsbZIP80 in group XI are divided into group U. This classification can be further rationalized by the later analyses of the gene structures and additional conserved motifs outside the bZIP domain.Considering the distinct functions the basic–hinge region and the Leu zipper may have, we separate them from the bZIP domains and make comparisons. Three phylograms are generated based on bZIP domains, basic and hinge regions and Leu zippers defined from the first leucine, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2). The phylogram of the basic and hinge regions presents a nice consistency with the tree built by the bZIP domain, which strongly supports our classification, while the phylogram of the Leu zipper region displays some differences. Members of group A are divided into three clusters; at the same time, ZmbZIP2 in group G inserts into a separated A cluster. This divergence between the basic–hinge region and the Leu zipper region signifies that the ZmbZIP transcription factors having the same DNA-binding sites might be required for different dimerization properties, and will be able to control a wide range of transcriptional responses as a result.3.3. Gene structure of ZmbZIP genesAs a kind of evolutionary relic, the intron–exon arrangement carries the imprint of the evolution of a gene family. It is interesting to find a similar gene structure in each group (Supplementary Fig. S3). There are 26 (15.3%) of the total ZmbZIP genes having no intron. This phenomenon occurs exclusively in groups S and F, accounting for 84.6 and 15.4%, respectively. Among those having introns, the number of introns within the open reading frame (ORF) ranges from 1 to 14, showing a great difference in the ZmbZIP family. A greater degree of variation in the number of introns exists in groups D and G, varying from 5 to 12 and 3 to 14, respectively, while the number of introns in the rest groups changes in a smaller range of numbers, mostly from 1 to 3. The intron positions within the ORF are diverse and the phases of the splicing sites differ from each other, but the positions and phases of introns in the basic and hinge regions of the bZIP domain are highly conserved. Six intron patterns of the ZmbZIP genes, from a to f, are identified based on the intron position, number and splicing phase within the basic and hinge regions (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. S4 and Table S1). Our result was supported by Nijhawan et al.8 Patterns a, b and c are in the majority. Pattern a has just one intron in phase 0 (P0) within the hinge region at the -5 position, which inserts between the amino acids Gln and Ala. Pattern b has two introns both in P0: one in the basic region at the -25 position and the other in the hinge region at the -5 position interrupting Lys and Ala. Pattern b only emerges in group D. Pattern c has a single intron at the -20 position in P2, inserting into the codon which encodes Arg. Patterns d and e are exclusive in group E and each is found in two ZmbZIP genes. Both of these patterns insert in the same position and same splicing P2. The only difference is that pattern d interrupts Arg, whereas pattern e interrupts Gln instead. Pattern f lacks any intron in the basic region and in the hinge region. Among 43 genes in pattern f, 26 members are intronless, while the remaining 17 have introns outside the basic and hinge regions. Pattern c occurs in most of the groups and consists of large members. Intron pattern within the basic and hinge regions of the bZIP domains of ZmbZIP proteins. P0 represent the intron splicing site between codons, P2 means the intron splicing site locating between the second nucleotide and the third nucleotide in one codon.Intron pattern within the basic and hinge regions of the bZIP domains of ZmbZIP proteins.

The identification of additional conserved motifs in ZmbZIP transcription factorsOne hundred and seventy ZmbZIP protein sequences were loaded into the MEME analysis tool and a total of 30 additional conserved motifs outside the bZIP domain have been identified (Supplementary Fig. S5 andTable S2). It can be observed that some motifs are shared by several groups, such as motifs 4, 10 and 15 present in three groups and motifs 6, 13, 14, 21, 22 and 25 present in two groups, respectively, while most of the conserved motifs appear in specific groups, which preliminarily proves our hypothesis that the group-specific motifs aid in determining specific functions for members in each group.Evidence suggests that members in group A have roles in abscisic acid response or stress signalling. Fifteen, 15 and 12 ZmbZIP proteins in group A contain motifs 14, 15 and 18, respectively. A part of these three motifs represent potential casein kinase II phosphorylation sites (S/TxxD/E), presented as T[DA]E[EA], [TG][LM]GE and T[VAS][DE]E in motifs 14, 15 and 18, respectively. These phosphorylation sites have been reported in many ABF (ABRE-binding factor) and AREB (ABA-responsive element-binding protein) in Arabidopsis.34–37 Motif 18 also contains a phosphorylation site for the Ca2+-dependent protein kinase (R/KxxS/T) presented as [KR][ED][IF][SVT]. ZmbZIP23 (ZmbZIP72 in a previous report) is one of the proteins in group A which has been experimentally verified to function as an ABA-dependent transcription factor in positive modulation of abiotic stress tolerance.38 Motif 15 can also be found in four members of group C and eight members of group D. Motifs 11 and 29 characterized by a part of the proline-rich domain are observed in group G exclusively, which have been shown to have transcriptional activation potential. Most of the members in group D share motifs 1, 2 and 5, which have unclear function. Besides, this largest group in the ZmbZIP protein family possesses the most unique motifs, for their dual-function of defence against pathogen and developmental regulation.39 Interestingly, there are some common motifs that co-exist in maize and rice.8 For example, motifs 1, 2 and 5 in group D of maize are in common with motifs 18, 20 and 19 in rice, respectively; motif 9 in group I of maize is the same as motif 9 in rice.3.5. The features of the three-dimensional structure of ZmbZIP proteinsThe 170 ZmbZIP protein sequences were aligned and the Chimera software was used to generate a conservation map (Fig. 2A). ZmbZIP14 is used as a model to display the conservation of the whole family. The red sphere represents the highly conserved regions and the labelled amino acids N280, R288, L298, L305 and L312 in red are the most conserved sites shared by all of the aligned ZmbZIP protein sequences. The conserved asparagine and arginine are located in the basic region and responsible for DNA binding, while the three conserved leucines are in the Leu zipper and help to form dimers.

Two of these models form homodimers (1DH3 and 2OQQ), whereas the other two form heterodimers (1T2K and 1YSA). The three-dimensional superposition map of four dimers is displayed (Fig. 2B). The overall structure of these dimers has been modelled as a Y-shaped complex, called ‘scissors-grip’ model.40 Also, the potential distribution of the bZIP domain shows that the enrichment region of positive charges is located at the top of Y, the basic region (Fig. 2C). The negative charges distribute across the stem region of Y, the leucine zipper region. As for dimerization in this region, situations must be more complicated due to the participation of more active forces.3.6. The prediction of DNA-binding site specificity of ZmbZIP transcription factorsExperiments of mutant proteins demonstrated that binding specificity is determined by the core basic region and the hinge region independently, and the two regions have an additive effect on DNA-binding specificity.41,42 The amino acid sequence alignment of the basic and hinge regions reveals some highly conserved amino acid residues within each group (Supplementary Fig. S6). The first leucine of the leucine zipper was regarded as +1, and asparagine and arginine are numbered -18 and -10, respectively. Experiments have shown that these two invariant sites can be functionally replaced by other amino acids, but their replacement will lead to new DNA-binding specificities.43 In the maize bZIP family, these replacements are infrequent and just occur in two groups. ZmbZIP51 and ZmbZIP118 in group U have a hydrophobic Ile residue at position -10 instead of Arg/Lys, indicating that they might not be able to bind DNA or might possess a unique DNA-binding specificity. Four members of group E have a conserved Lys substitution at position -18 instead of Arg, implying a different requirement for dimerization. Further, we can predict the DNA-binding specificity in a group manner, as described in Supplementary Table S3.3.7. Analysis of the 170 maize Leu zippers and prediction of dimerization propertyThe procedure of sequence-specific DNA binding requires dimerization. To define the basis of the dimerization stability and predict the dimerization specificity of 170 ZmbZIP proteins, we follow the standard nomenclature for the seven unique amino acid positions (a, b, c, d, e, f and g) to arrange the Leu zipper44 (Supplementary Fig. S7). The first heptad is from four amino acids before the occurrence of the first leucine in the bZIP domain and from g to f. The boundaries of both N-terminal and C-terminal of the ZmbZIP Leu zippers have been demarcated following the criteria once used for the bZIP proteins of Arabidopsis, rice and humans.45Because of their special locations near the Leu zipper interface, the amino acids at the a, d, e and g positions play key roles in regulating leucine zipper oligomerization, dimerization stability and dimerization specificity. Thus, we focus on the characteristics of the amino acids at these positions to perform our prediction. Amino acids at the a and d positions are typically hydrophobic and on the surface of the a-helix.46 These features are perfect for the interaction between two monomers because they create a hydrophobic core which is essential for dimer stability.47 The positions of e and g abound in charged amino acids, including acidic amino acids E and D, and basic amino acids R and K. The electrostatic interactions between amino acids at position g and oppositely charged amino acids at position e’ (the prime means a residue on the opposite helix of the leucine zipper) can form interhelical salt bridges which mediate the dimerization and determine the dimerization specificity as well as stability.48 Experiments of the replacements of charged amino acids into alanine at position g or e lead to the formation of tetramers instead of dimers,49 thus charged amino acids at the g and e positions prevent formation of higher-order oligomers. At the same time, the asparagine at the a position can form a polar pocket in the hydrophobic interface that limits oligomerization when interacting interhelically.In ZmbZIP proteins, hydrophobic amino acids are predominant at the a and d positions as they account for more than 84% of the total (Fig. 2D). About 22% of amino acids present at the a position are asparagines with nearly equivalent amount of rice (23%). Specific to each heptad (Fig. 2E), it displays the high frequency of Asn at the a position both in the second and fifth heptads, accounting for 47.6 and 49.4%, respectively. It differs from rice and Arabidopsis, which have the highest frequency of Asn at the a position in the second heptad and followed by the fifth heptad. The fourth and eighth heptads also have the appearances of Asn with the frequency of 8 and 12.4%, respectively. The high frequency of Asn at the a position implies that it will form a good number of homodimerizing Leu zippers among the bZIP family, because asparagines produce more stable N–N interactions at the a<U+2194>a' position than other a position amino acids.50 There are also charged amino acids found at the a position which will drive heterodimer formation. Strikingly, the frequency of stabilizing leucine at the d position in ZmbZIPs is found to be 70%, which is much the same as rice (71%) but is significantly greater than in Arabidopsis (56%). These similarities might not be a coincidence; it implies a homologous relationship between these two monocotyledons. The charged amino acids occupy almost half of the e and g positions, with frequencies of 42 and 59%, respectively.To analyse the contribution of charged residues at the e and g positions in governing dimerization properties of ZmbZIP proteins, we calculate the presence of attractive and repulsive g<U+2194>e' pairs in each heptad of maize leucine zippers (Supplementary Fig. S7), and the histogram of their frequency is presented in Fig. 2F. If both the g and the following e position amino acids are charged, they refer to the complete g<U+2194>e' pairs and the successive six amino acids from g to e are colour coded. If only the g or e position is charged, it refers to the incomplete g<U+2194>e' pairs and only the charged amino acids are colour coded. The complete g<U+2194>e' pairs are classified into four groups according to the electrostatic charges at the g and e positions. A blue box indicates that the g position is acidic and the following e position is basic (±attractive; blue). An orange box indicates that the g position is basic and the following e position is acidic (±attractive; orange). The pink and green boxes indicate that the g and the following e positions have a similar charge, either both basic (basic repulsive; pink) or both acidic (acidic repulsive; green). It can be found that the maximum frequency of the complete g<U+2194>e' pairs appears in the first heptads, among which, the pink boxes are in the majority. The frequencies of the complete g<U+2194>e' pairs in the next three heptads decrease dramatically. In the fifth heptads, the frequency of attractive g<U+2194>e' pairs increases. Few complete g<U+2194>e' pairs are observed in the eighth heptads except two repulsive g<U+2194>e' pairs. Moreover, only blue boxes are present in the ninth heptads. When two helices with blue or orange boxes dimerize, the acidic and basic residues on opposite helices interact to create two self-complementary salt bridges. It is all possible that the helices are identical or not; thus, the interaction between two attractive g<U+2194>e' pairs would not prefer homodimerization or heterodimerization. However, the helices with pink and green boxes prefer to interact with each other rather than themselves; thus, they favour the formation of heterodimers. Biophysical measurements also show that repulsive g<U+2194>e' pairs are more important than attractive g<U+2194>e' pairs in driving dimerization specificity. There are 32% of the g<U+2194>e' interactions containing single-charged amino acids. These leucine zippers with incomplete g<U+2194>e' pairs will have more promiscuous dimerization activity and contribute little to the stability of the homodimer. However, in a heterodimer, they can form complete attractive g<U+2194>e' interactions and contribute to stability through complementation.According to the analyses above, we categorize 170 ZmbZIP proteins into 26 subfamilies (BZ1–BZ26) on the basis of the defining properties of dimerization specificity, which was proposed by Vinson et al. We can conclude that four subfamilies (BZ1–BZ4) favour homodimerization because of attractive g<U+2194>e' pairs in the first heptad and lacking of any repulsive interactions. Most of the subfamilies have both homo- and heterodimerization properties (BZ5–BZ23) for three reasons: (i) all have more than one asparagines at the a position, which favour homodimerizing strongly; (ii) the existence of repulsive g<U+2194>e' pairs in these subfamilies can inhibit homodimerization; (iii) the incomplete g<U+2194>e' pairs can promote promiscuous heterodimerization. Only three subfamilies (BZ24–BZ26) can be considered as having apparent heterodimerizing specificity because they contain only repulsive interhelical interactions. All these go to prove the complexity and diversity of the dimerization patterns in the Leu zipper of the ZmbZIP protein family, with the potential to homodimerize with themselves or with members in the same subfamily as well as heterodimerize with other subfamily members.Based on the criteria to define the boundaries and natural C terminus, we can observe that the length of the Leu zipper in the ZmbZIP transcription factor family is variable, ranging from three to nine heptads. Of the ZmbZIP proteins, 27% have only three short zippers (BZ1 and BZ26), and more than 17% have no a-helix breakers for 10 or more heptads (BZ18–BZ23). These longer Leu zippers have been used to define multiple families of homodimerizing bZIP proteins in Arabidopsis.3.8. Chromosomal distribution of the bZIP gene family and genetic analysisThe results of the chromosomal distribution map (Supplementary Fig. S8) along with the histogram of the number of ZmbZIP genes on each chromosome (Supplementary Fig. S9) show that the 125 ZmbZIP genes dispersed non-uniformly across the 10 chromosomes, varying from 9 to 17. Chromosome 1 distributes most of the bZIP genes with the number 17, accounting for 13.6% of the total, whereas chromosomes 9 and 10 have the least genes with the number of 9, accounting for 7.2% of the total. Genes in different groups also distribute unevenly on chromosomes. Members of group D distribute more evenly than other groups across all chromosomes on a minor scale. No group of genes displays a preferential distribution on a specific chromosome.Gene duplication and positive selection play an extremely important part in gene family expansion and protein functional diversification.51 To explore the contribution of duplication events to this family, we analyse the occurrences of tandem duplication and large-scale segmental duplication during the evolution of this gene family. Among them, the gene cluster is one of the results of gene duplication. In our analysis, six ZmbZIP gene clusters are composed of 12 bZIP genes existing in the maize genome (Supplementary Table S4) and define clusters where the linked genes in the same gene family were not interrupted by more than 8 other ORFs as explained in Richly et al.52 The majority of ZmbZIP genes are singletons. Within the gene clusters, a pair of genes can be identified as a tandem duplication cluster, since they meet the three conditions according to Shiu et al.53 Thus, we can make an inference that the expansion of the ZmbZIP transcription factor family might not rely on the independent duplication of individual sequences and might be the consequence of segmental chromosomal duplication and rearrangement events. Similar analyses from rice, Arabidopsis and sorghum also support this inference.Since the segmentally duplicated chromosome blocks in maize have been identified at a genome-wide level, we can use the SyMap to compute and view these syntenic blocks.54 The syntenic blocks on each chromosome and the distribution map of bZIP genes on each chromosome are vertically arranged together to view if the genes are located on the syntenic duplicated segmental regions (Supplementary Fig. S10). Fifty-eight ZmbZIP genes located on the duplicated segmental regions of maize chromosomes at the minimum identity score for collinear gene pairs of 0.4 are identified via the GenoPix 2D Plotter software (Supplementary Table S5). Interestingly, all these collinear ZmbZIP gene pairs located on the syntenic regions belong to the same groups. Among them, eighteen members of group D constitute the most collinear gene pairs (49 of 75), accounting for 65%, and more than half the members of group I (12 of 20) are observed to be present on the duplicated segments of maize chromosomes. Thirty-three of these genes segmentally duplicated once and the rest duplicated more than once. Surprisingly, all but four members of group D located in syntenic regions segmentally duplicate at a high frequency, with the maximum of 11 times. On the contrary, no member of group S is found to be located in the syntenic duplicated region, implying that this group might evolve after the emergence of large-scale segmental duplication events. All these results suggest that the expansion of ZmbZIP genes is largely a consequence of segmental chromosomal duplication events.3.9. Expression analysis of ZmbZIP transcription factors in global transcriptome at different developmental stages in specific organsA total number of 154 probes detected in R represent 116 ZmbZIP genes and can be assigned to 154 corresponding transcripts (Supplementary Table S6). To understand the temporal and spatial transcription patterns of the ZmbZIP genes in the maize life cycle, a hierarchy cluster was performed to visualize a global transcription profile of the ZmbZIP genes across the 11 organs at different developmental stages. As illustrated in Fig. 3, the heatmap can be apparently divided into three clusters. Cluster I has 51 members (excluding the E2 enzyme as the reference). Cluster II has 47 members and 32 genes belong to cluster III. Genes in cluster I obviously have relatively high expression levels, with the mean of the log-signal values of each gene ranging from 10 to 14. On the contrary, cluster II contains the genes with relatively low expression levels and the mean of the log-signal values of each gene is within the range of four to eight. In cluster III, genes are expressed in a mid-level with the mean of log-signal values from 6 to 10. To identify putative differentially expressed genes in specific organs or stages, we calculate the coefficient of variation (CV value; CV = SD/mean, where SD represents the standard deviation and mean describes the mean expression level of a gene across all the tissues) of each gene in the three clusters to compare the degree of variation of each gene among distinct organs55 (Supplementary Table S7). The results show huge variation among all the genes with the CV values ranging from 1 to 44%. The gene with the least CV value is the reference gene, E2 enzyme. It suggests that E2 enzyme is a housekeeping gene in maize, which is expressed uniformly in all tissues. And the gene with the highest CV value is ZmbZIP85 in cluster III. Interestingly, ZmbZIP85 is one of the few well-documented bZIP genes in maize, O2, which regulate the synthesis of the main storage proteins in seeds. As shown in the figure, ZmbZIP85 specifically accumulates in the developing endosperm from the 12 DAP (days after pollination) to 24 DAP. Our data confirm the known fact that O2 is a pivotal positive regulator of seed development.

A hierarchical clustering in the left showing three kinds of expression patterns of ZmbZIP genes in maize development. The colour scale representing average signal values is shown at the top.Cluster I has the least expression variability from 1 to 18%, indicating a most stable expression pattern relative to other ZmbZIP genes. The most changeable genes in this cluster are ZmbZIP87 and 64 with CV values 14 and 18%, respectively. It is notable that these two genes seem to have an opposite effect compared with ZmbZIP85. Their expression levels significantly decrease during endosperm development, which, in turn, implies that they might act as negative regulators in seed development. It can be further divided into two subclusters in cluster II. Genes in the first subcluster have lower signal values and more stable expression pattern than those in the second subcluster. There are seven genes with CV values more than 15% in cluster II, among which three genes have CV values more than 20%. These three genes are ZmbZIP50, 68 and 72. It should be pointed out that the transcriptional activation of bZIP transcription factors are required for dimerization. Therefore, it is reasonable to observe a synergistic effect formed in many bZIP proteins in specific stages, such as ZmbZIP50 and 68 in the V1 (vegetative 1, with first leaf fully extended) primary root stage and the VE (vegetative emergence) whole seedling stage. Obviously, ZmbZIP118 might play a role in the development of pistil, deducing from the significantly up-regulated expression level in silk. Genes in cluster III show an apparent fluctuation, with the CV value ranging from 6 to 44%. In this cluster, 56.3% (18 genes) are with a CV value more than 15%, including 12 genes with a CV value greater than 20%. Among them, ZmbZIP41 and 56 from group E increase their expression levels in silk and the early developmental stages of seeds. ZmbZIP108 and 67 from group H have a similar expression pattern and increase their expression levels in the early and late developmental stages of the leaf. Besides ZmbZIP85, many genes show the up-regulation pattern in the development of the seed and the endosperm, such as ZmbZIP74, -107, -125, -38, -1, -89, -25, -104, -91 and -27. In addition, some genes exhibit novel and differential expression during the development of the embryo. For instance, ZmbZIP110.1, 110.2  and 65.1 are with down-regulated expression in the developing embryo, whereas ZmbZIP40.1, -40.2, -105, -19.2, -94, -104 and -85 are with up-regulated expression.3.10. Expression of ZmbZIP genes under drought stress and fungal infectionsAs a kind of ubiquitous transcription factors, bZIP proteins regulate the expression of a wide spectrum of stress-related genes. The log2 (treated/control) ratio values are illustrated by a heatmap (Fig. 4A and B), showing the fold change of each ZmbZIP gene compared with the control. A total of 46 probe sets discovered on the maize18k GeneChip could be assigned to 40 ZmbZIP genes with matches of more than eight (Supplementary Table S8). The probe sets that represent the same gene are named _a to _c and ordered by group.

PCC values higher than 0.6 are represented by solid lines and values lower than -0.6 are represented by dashed lines.To explore the roles of ZmbZIP genes in drought stress, the microarrary data of two different inbred lines, a drought-tolerant line, Han21 line, and a drought-sensitive line, Ye478 line, under three treatments have been used (Fig. 4A). Interestingly, most of the genes which show a response to drought stress show a similar expression pattern in two inbred lines, whereas although still some distinct differences can be carefully observed. Many bZIP transcription factors in plants have been reported to be closely related to drought stress. In rice, two proteins that have close phylogenetic relationship with members of group A in maize, OsbZIP23 and OsbZIP72, play a role in ABA response and drought tolerance.56,57 Their orthologous gene ZmbZIP37 also increases its expression level under drought stress, implying a possible positive regulatory role. Another protein, OsbZIP52/RISBZ5, an orthologous gene of ZmbZIP112, can significantly down-regulate the drought-related genes by overexpression in rice.58 Contrary to OsbZIP52, ZmbZIP112 is highly expressed under a drought stress condition; AtbZIP1 is reported as a positive regulator in Arabidopsis which shows tolerance to salt, osmotic and drought stresses.59 Its ortholog, ZmbZIP74, has a divergence in two lines. In the Han21 line, ZmbZIP74 has no change in the expression level, while in the drought-sensitive line, Ye478, it is up-regulated under severe drought condition. This phenomenon can be modestly explained as a more complicated regulatory mechanism being involved in drought stress in the Han21 line irrelevant to the bZIP protein, compared with the bZIP-dependent drought stress regulatory mechanism active in the Ye478 line.To discover the ZmbZIP genes involved in maize pathogen response, we detect differentially expressed genes with microarray data. Data sets of four experiments under the treatments of Ustilago maydis, Colletotrichum graminicola, Fusarium moniliforme and Sphacelotheca reiliana infection have been analysed. The first two series of experiments focus on the time course, and the last two series focus on the comparisons between the resistant line and the susceptible line or between treatment and control, respectively.As shown in Fig. 4B, after the infection of U. maydis, four members in group D increase their expression levels and accumulate mostly on the 8th day. And five members from group I also show up-regulated expression levels over time, especially of ZmbZIP19 and ZmbZIP53. It can be concluded that the gene expression profiles are more variable with time under U. maydis infection. A similar situation can be found under an infection of C. graminicola. The gene expression levels at 96 h post-infection are more changeable than those at 36 h post-infection. Among them, ZmbZIP65, 21 and 53 show up-regulated expression, while the gene expression levels of ZmbZIP94, 62 and 92 are significantly down-regulated when compared with the control. It is very interesting to observe the differences between the resistant line Bt-1 and the susceptible line Ye478 under an infection of F. moniliforme. More genes are up-regulated in the Bt-1 line (seven genes) than those in the Ye478 line (three genes). Strikingly, two genes, ZmbZIP62 and 88, up-regulated in the Ye478 line are apparently down-regulated in the Bt-1 line, whereas the reverse situation occurs in ZmbZIP83, implying the counter effects these three genes might have on these two lines. Compared with mock-infected controls, seven genes in group D are up-regulated when infected with S. reiliana, suggesting that many genes in this group might participate in the pathogen response. This result as with the situation under U. maydis infection is consistent with the fact that group D proteins might be involved in integrating different systemic signals (SA and ethylene) and response to pathogen attack in Arabidopsis.To test whether ZmbZIP genes are co-expressed in maize pathogen responses especially for their dimerization character, we calculate the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) among pairwise genes60 based on the transcriptome data from 62 microarray experiments as mentioned above (Supplementary Table S9). A network is made to show the strongly correlated gene pairs which have a PCC value of 0.6 or higher (in bold edge) and -0.6 or lower (in dashed edge), where the negative sign here means negative correlation (Fig. 4C).In the network, calculations have been made and strong correlations exist between 156 pairs of genes. Among them, 13 pairs of genes show strong negative correlations with a PCC value of =0.6, and this study also demonstrates strongly positive correlations between the rest of the 143 gene pairs with the PCC value of =0.6. Interestingly, connections from ZmbZIP8_a, ZmbZIP8_b and ZmbZIP56 are all dashed lines, which signify strongly negative correlations of these two genes with other genes. In addition, most of the negative correlations are related to these two genes, accounting for 84.6% of the total. Other negative correlations are presented by two gene pairs, ZmbZIP20–45 and ZmbZIP20–62. As for the gene pairs with positive correlation, we concentrate on the six gene pairs with a PCC value of >0.9. These gene pairs all belong to the same groups, indicating that they might be paralogous genes sharing the nearest phylogenetic relationship with each other. For example, the ZmbZIP40_a–105 gene pair from group D has a complete positive correlation with a PCC value of 1 and shows similar expression patterns in the fungal infections. In addition, the point to be noted is that high correlation may give two clues: co-functional genes or duplication of promoters. Since some of the genes within a group may have similar promoter cis-elements, they would have similar patterns of expression involved in potential roles in dimerization.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe project was supported by the Natural Science Foundation of Fujian Province, China (Grant No. B0810040).We are grateful to the providers who submitted the microarray data to the public expression databases which can be applied freely.Supplementary data"

IntroductionRecent studies show that protein-coding genes use codon patterns to fine-tune translation and increase protein synthesis efficiency.1–7 Three types of codon usages have been proposed to influence translation. First, use of single codons may influence the speed and accuracy of translation.3,5–11 Frequent use of ‘preferred codons’ is believed to maximize translation efficiency.12 This hypothesis takes previous observations in Escherichia coli and several other unicellular microbes as supporting evidence.13 In these small organisms, highly expressed genes are found to have more extreme codon bias, where codon bias denotes non-equilibrium usage of up to six synonymous codons encoding for the same amino acids, with ‘preferred codons’ in highly expressed genes corresponding to the most abundant isoaccepting tRNAs.12Second, codon pair usage is associated with translation efficiency, wherein a codon pair indicates two successive codons.14–17 The biased use of codon pairs is a common phenomenon in a wide range of species.18 The observed codon pair frequency often deviates from expected values predicted from two single codons. Some codon pairs are overrepresented and others underrepresented. A variety of selective or non-selective factors are responsible for such bias.19 One such factor is that codon pair usage affects translation.15,20 In fact, peptide bond formation requires simultaneous accommodation of two codons and of two tRNAs in the ribosomal A and P sites.21 For spatial reasons, it is thought that not all codon and tRNA combinations are equally compatible on the ribosome surface.22 Some combinations of codon pairs and tRNAs would be advantageous for translation efficiency.20 Structural features that regulate tRNA geometry within the ribosome govern codon pair patterns, driving enhanced translational fidelity and/or rate.14 Experimental results support such a mechanism.17,22Third, an interesting bias of successive synonymous codon pairs was found in eight eukaryotic genomes.1,2,4 Synonymous codon pair denotes a codon that recurs after its synonymy within a gene, regardless of how many codons encode other amino acids, and requiring only that there are not other synonymies between the two. In this study, bias of synonymous codon pairs denotes a difference between actual and expected frequencies when they are independent. Cannarozzi et al.1 found a strong tendency to use the same codon a second time as for the first synonymy. There is a bias towards the most closely related synonymous wobble codons, if the same codon is not reused. This predisposition towards selecting particular codons, rather than arbitrarily choosing one from the successive synonymous set, is termed ‘autocorrelation’ or ‘codon reuse’, and has important implications for protein translation. Based on comprehensive analyses of highly expressed genes, it was suggested that codon reuse may provide an effective mechanism to speed up translation.1 Through wet-bench experiments, it was successfully demonstrated that translation on autocorrelated mRNA was substantially (30%) faster than on anti-correlated mRNA.1 Therefore, this result reinforces the speculation that codon reuse could benefit translation efficiency.1Due to its intimate relationship with translation efficiency, biased use of single codons and codon pairs has been studied extensively. However, biased use of successive codon pairs is relatively new.1,2 Cannarozzi and colleagues observed this phenomenon in eukaryotes.1 Here, we performed cross-species analysis of ‘codon reuse’ in 136 prokaryotes. We not only show the existence of ‘codon reuse’ in various prokaryotic genomes and hence illustrate it as a universal mechanism among the three domains of life, but also compare the level of biases among various prokaryotes. Most importantly, we observed that the overall bias intensity for successive synonymous codon pairs is positively correlated with several genomic factors. Using genomic G + C content, genome size, and tRNA gene numbers as limiting factors, the bias value could be predicted with high accuracy. Thus, these data reinforce the notion that the genome contains all the information necessary for regulating protein translation.2. Materials and methodsWe randomly picked one strain from each of prokaryotic species sequenced. Genome sequences and annotations were downloaded from the NCBI RefSeq project (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria) for 136 prokaryotic strains before June 2010. These 136 strains consisted of 109 bacteria and 27 archaea. Information on genome size, G + C content, and tRNA gene number was extracted from the RefSeq annotation.23 For all genomes, tRNA was assigned to 64 codons according to the extended wobble rule.24 According to the wobble rule, we adopt the consistent pattern for assigning codons to isoaccepting tRNAs for all 136 prokaryotic genomes, and it is similar with Cannarozzi et al.1 In Supplementary Table S1, the correspondence of codons to tRNAs is illustrated with E. coli as an example. In fact, there may exist some modifications of the wobble rule. For example, large bacterial genomes with high G + C% usually have tRNAs with a C-starting anticodon solely responsible for a G-ending codon, and the number of this tRNA gene is often multiple and larger than that for the respective isoaccepting tRNA responsible for both G- and A-ending codons. Another example is the presence of I in Arg tRNAs found in a wide range of bacteria. While A-ending codons are thought to be recognized by I-containing tRNA on the basis of the extended wobble rule, the efficiency of I-A recognition is low and there are often (but not always) other tRNAs responsible for A-ending (and G-ending) codons. However, we do not know the modification will appear in which specific genome. Therefore, we do not consider any of the modifications when calculating the bias of successive synonymous codon pairs.For comparison, correlation of synonymous codon pairs in eight eukaryotes was also investigated (Arabidopsis thaliana, Ashbya gossypii, Caenorhabditis elegans, Candida glabrata, Drosophila melanogaster, Homo sapiens, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, and Schizosaccharomyces pombe).The standard deviation in Equation (1) is calculated based on actual numbers and expected numbers of the collection of all synonymous codon pairs or isoaccepting tRNA pairs. The distribution of codon pairs in Fig. 1 and genomes in Fig. 2 is fitted by the Gauss function.25 A linear relationship between various genomic factors and the general Z score is fitted with single variable or multiple linear regression.25 Differences in Z scores between two groups of prokaryotic genomes were statistically validated by t-tests.25 All statistical analyses were implemented with the freely available R package (http://www.r-project.org/).

Results3.1. Synonymous codon correlation in E. coli K12 genomeWe evaluated 107 bacterial and 29 archaeal genomes. In the following two sections, E. coli K12 is taken as an example. We evaluated all pairs of consecutive synonymous codons in the E. coli K12. Pairs coding for nine amino acids (alanine, arginine, glycine, isoleucine, proline, leucine, serine, threonine, and valine), which have at least two tRNAs, were considered for further analysis. The frequency of all combinations (e.g. TCCTCT as one combination) was then calculated. Assuming a random distribution, the expected number of all combinations could be estimated from the actual single codon frequencies. According to Equation (1), the Z score quantifies the difference between the actual frequency of a combination from the expected frequency, in terms of the number of standard deviations.25 We classified each synonymous codon pair as favoured, if the difference is larger than 3 s.d., as neutral if between -3 and +3 s.d., or disfavoured if less than -3 s.d. The numbers for three groups of synonymous codon pairs for each amino acid are summarized in Table 1. Among codon pairs with isoacceptors (sharing a tRNA), favoured numbers are all larger than neutral or disfavoured ones. However, the opposite result is obtained for synonymous codon pairs without isoacceptors. These results indicate that the reuse of codons sharing the same tRNA is a universal phenomenon for the nine E. coli amino acids examined. This observation is similar to that seen in eukaryotes.1 It is worth noting that the strength of synonymous codon correlation in E. coli is much smaller than that in yeast. For example, the mean Z score for 10 groups of synonymous codon pairs encoding the amino acid serine is 8.6469 in yeast1 and only 5.8762 in E. coli. As mentioned below, Z scores of synonymous codon pairs in prokaryotes are generally lower than those seen in eukaryotes. The numbers of three kinds of synonymous codon pairs for nine amino acids in E. coliCodon pairs are grouped into those with and without isoacceptors (sharing a tRNA), by parsimony. Within each group, pairs were classified as favoured (=3 s.d.), neutral (between -3 and +3 s.d.), or disfavoured (=-3 s.d.).The numbers of three kinds of synonymous codon pairs for nine amino acids in E. coliCodon pairs are grouped into those with and without isoacceptors (sharing a tRNA), by parsimony.

Confirming the hypothesis of translation selectionOne reason may account for the codon correlation illustrated above. There is selection pressure for codon ordering in protein-coding genes, and, hence, synonymous codons sharing the same tRNA are successively used.1 However, there also exists a second explanation.1 Different genes may be enriched in different codons, and the correlation observed at the genomic level may be due to the accumulation of given codons in specific genes. If the second case is real, the synonymous codon correlation should remain, if codon distribution is shuffled within each gene individually.1 In the first case, such codon shuffling would reduce the difference of codon correlation between isoacceptor pairs and non-isoacceptor pairs. We performed shuffle experiments in E. coli K12 to test which hypothesis is correct. Results are shown in Fig. 1, where the vertical axis denotes synonymous codon pair frequency in the corresponding range of Z scores. Similar to Cannarozzi et al.,1 codon correlations were found to decrease for isoaccepting pairs for the shuffled genes and increase for non-isoaccepting pairs. The difference between the isoaccepting pairs and non-isoaccepting pairs without shuffle (Fig. 1A, t-test, P = 2.2 × 10-14) is significantly larger than the difference after shuffle (Fig. 1B, t-test, P = 3.3 × 10-11). Thus, autocorrelation was not simply due to codon bias at the gene level, but due to codon ordering within genes. To reinforce the hypothesis of translation selection, we also analysed synonymous codon correlation in non-coding regions (i.e. intergenic sequences). The Z scores histograms for isoaccepting and non-isoaccepting pairs are shown in Fig. 1C (t-test, P = 1.0 × 10-3). The difference between the two types of codon pairs for intergenic sequences is not only much smaller than that for the gene sequences but also smaller than that for the shuffled gene sequences. Based on this analysis and that by Cannarozzi et al.,1 the pattern of codon reuse exists in protein-coding sequences and reinforces the hypothesis that the conserved pattern is rooted in translation selection.3.3. Varied strengths of codon reuse in prokaryotic genomesWe investigated synonymous codon correlation in 107 bacteria and 29 archaea. Taxonomic distribution of these genomes is summarized in Table 2. As can be seen, 107 bacteria are widely distributed across 14 phyla, and 29 archaea are distributed across 5 phyla. Therefore, most known prokaryotic phyla have representatives in our dataset. To compare the strength of synonymous codon correlation among different genomes, we calculated the Z general score for each genome. This value is equal to the Z score averaged for nine amino acids, and for each amino acid, the Z score is averaged for all isoaccepting tRNA pairs. First, we compared the general Z sores in the three domains of life. Among the eight eukaryotes, the mean value of the general Z scores is 15.0. However, the value is as small as 5.6 in bacteria and 3.2 in archaea. This indicates that the strength of codon reuse is much smaller in prokaryotes than in eukaryotes, although the strength in the former is also significant. The 136 prokaryotic genomes, collectively, have a mean Z score of 5.1 and standard deviation of 3.1. Streptomyces coelicolor A3 has the largest Z score of 15.1. Note that this genome has the highest G + C content and is one of largest of the 136 prokaryote genomes. In contrast, Nanoarchaeum equitans Kin4-M has the smallest Z score of 0.72 and is also the smallest genome. Ninety-eight prokaryotic genomes have Z scores larger than 3.0, indicating that 72% of the genomes have significant usage bias of successive synonymous codons. Histogram of the general Z scores is shown in Fig. 2, and, as can be seen, the genera distribution could not be well fitted by a simple Gaussian function because it has two peaks. Taxonomic distribution of 136 prokaryotic genomes analysed in this studyTaxonomic distribution of 136 prokaryotic genomes analysed in this studyThe phylogenetic relationship among the 136 prokaryotic genomes is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. This tree is constructed using the neighbor-joining method26,27 based on 16S rRNA sequences. To comprehend the phylogenetic tree, some factors (e.g. taxonomy ID, organism name, general Z score, genome size, and G + C content) of 136 prokaryotic genomes are listed in Supplementary Table S2. For each genome, the general Z score is marked on the right side of the name. When visualized in this manner, it is clear that the strength of synonymous codon correlation changes with phylogeny. In fact, there is no consistent pattern for Z score variation among different phylogenetic groups. Some groups have very similar scores, whereas others do not. To illustrate the trend from the phylogenetic order, Tables 3, 4 and 5 list the mean Z scores and standard deviation at three levels: phylum, family, and genus. As can be seen, the mean standard deviation changes from 1.53 to 1.42 to 0.90, when the classifying level changes from phylum to family to genus. Correspondingly, the mean variance coefficient changes from 0.34 to 0.24 to 0.21. Therefore, it appears to naturally follow that the Z scores will be more similar at a lower phylogenetic level. The mean Z scores and SD at the level of phylumVC denotes variance coefficient in Table 3, 4 and 5, respectively.The mean Z scores and SD at the level of phylumVC denotes variance coefficient in Table 3, 4 and 5, respectively.The mean Z scores and SD at the level of familyThe mean Z scores and SD at the level of familyThe mean Z scores and SD at the level of genusThe mean Z scores and SD at the level of genus3.4. Comparative analyses of codon reuse strengths among different groupsThe 136 prokaryotic genomes could be classified into two groups based on the Gram type, oxygen metabolism, growth rate, G + C content, genome size, and tRNA gene number, respectively. We performed comparative analyses of the general Z scores between any two groups based on the six classifying criteria and results are listed in Table 6. For all criteria except Gram type and oxygen metabolism, the two groups are divided equally based on median criterion values. Z scores of the two groups are generally significantly different based on all classifying criteria, except Gram type. Among the five indices with significant differences, genome size and tRNA gene number are the most sensitive as the P-value is the smallest. Based on the descending order of statistical difference, the other three indices will be G + C content, oxygen metabolism, and growth rate. It is interesting that the two most frequently used classifying criteria, oxygen metabolism and Gram type, are not associated with variance of synonymous codon pair strength as are genomic features such as G + C content, genome size, and tRNA gene number.

DiscussionCannarozzi et al. first observed the phenomenon of successive synonymous codon pairs in eukaryotic genomes in 2010.1 Fredrick and Ibba comment that this work is one of the best examples illustrating how codon usage patterns control ribosome speed and fine-tune translation to increase protein synthesis efficiency.2 They call on immediate work on bacterial genomes in which translation rates are substantially higher than eukaryotes.2 Interestingly, we found that most prokaryotic genomes have significant biases in successive synonymous codon pairs, suggesting that this pattern is universal to the three domains of life. Significantly, different distributions of synonymous codon pairs between protein-coding genes and intergenic sequences suggest that this bias is a result from translation selection. Combined with the previous work,1 we conclude that the bias of successive synonymous codon pairs, as universal pattern in all living organisms, would be a translation-associated effect and could be used to fine-tune protein synthesis.Furthermore, the strength of the bias varies strongly across different genomes. Eukaryotic cells have the strongest bias, whereas archaeal cells have the least. Among bacteria, there is also a range of differences. Usually, large bacterial genomes and those with high G + C content tend to have a stronger bias. This type of variation reflects the diversity of living species. A better understanding of the precise reason for varied strength may be clarified by comparing these results with single codon bias. Generally, highly expressed genes tend to have more of a bias with single codons8,11,28–35 in unicellular organisms. Codon bias is thought to maximize translation efficiency, including speed and/or fidelity.9,11,12,28,30–35 The strength of the codon bias is determined by the strength of translation selection exerted on the genome.13 For example, species exposed to selection for rapid growth tend to have more strongly selected codon usage bias.36,37 At the same time, fast-growing bacteria with low generation time generally have more tRNA genes to increase translation speed.13,38 And, tRNA gene number is positively correlated with genome size and G + C content.39 Because the general Z scores of bacteria are also associated with these factors, the correlation between the bias strength of successive codon pairs and various genomic or biochemical characters in prokaryotes may be caused by the translation selection as the single codon bias. One lingering question is why single codon bias is almost absent, or at least smaller, in higher eukaryotic genomes.37 However, the strength of successive codon pair bias is much stronger in higher eukaryotes than in prokaryotes. Our current thought is that this may be due to different translation mechanisms among the three domains of life.Another noticeable point is how translation influences synonymous codon pair usage or why codon reuse favours translation efficiency. Cannarozzi et al. have proposed that tRNA diffusion is slower than both reloading and translation.1 When the next amino acid that is incorporated is the same, a recently used tRNA would be more likely than any of its isoacceptors to still be in the vicinity of the ribosome.1 Therefore, reuse of isoaccepting codons would accelerate the translation process.1 Direct observation of slower tRNA diffusion than reloading and translation would be the most potent proof for this hypothesis.Successive synonymous codon pair represents the order of protein-coding sequences rather than their composition, which is different from single codon use.2,4 Therefore, the observed bias of successive synonymous codon pairs, as a newly observed phenomenon, illustrates that regulatory information of protein translation is retained not only in nucleotide species but also in nucleotide order. Widely observed association of single codon,3,5,6,8,9,11–13 codon pair14–22 or successive synonymous codon pair1,2 use and translation efficiency suggests that the latter exerts influence on the various types of codons. On the other hand, genome size, G + C content and tRNA gene number are all significantly associated with the bias strength of synonymous codon pairs, illustrating that translation selection exerts influence on different genomic features. Taking all factors into consideration, we conclude that translation selection is exerted on genome sequences at multiple levels and by various mechanisms. In other words, protein translation is a complex process and is associated with various factors such as usage of single codons, codon pairs (in particular successive synonymous codon pair), genome size, genomic G + C content, and tRNA gene number.Conflict of Interest statementThe authors have no conflicts of interest to declare.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the National Natural Science Foundation of China (grant 31071109), the special fund of China Postdoctoral Science Foundation (grant 201104687), and the program for New Century Excellent Talents in University (grant number NCET-11-0059).

IntroductionCommon wheat (Triticum aestivum L., genome constitution AABBDD) is an allohexaploid species that arose by natural hybridization between tetraploid wheat Triticum turgidum L. (AABB), including emmer and durum wheats, and a diploid wild wheat relative Aegilops tauschii Coss. (DD).1,2Ae. tauschii is widely distributed in Eurasia and shows abundant genetic variation.3–11 Population structure analyses revealed two major phylogenetic lineages and an HG17 minor lineage [haplogroup lineage (HGL) 17] in Ae. tauschii.12 In turn, the major lineages 1 (L1) and 2 (L2) can be genealogically divided into six and three sublineages, respectively. It is supposed that the Ae. tauschii populations involved in the origin of common wheat are limited to a narrow distribution range, apparently restricted to L2, which has given rise to a founder effect in hexaploid wheat.12,13 In fact, the D-genome of common wheat is less polymorphic than the A- and B-genomes.14–16 Tetraploid wheat and Ae. tauschii can be crossed artificially to produce synthetic hexaploid wheat.17,18 These synthetics can be used as intermediates to exploit the natural variation of Ae. tauschii in hexaploid wheat improvement.19High-resolution genetic map construction is important for genetic and genomic research, as well as for molecular breeding.20 In wheat, genetic maps are commonly constructed using simple sequence repeats (SSR) markers,21,22 but the number of SSR markers reported in public databases such as the National BioResource Project (NBRP) KOMUGI website (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/wheat/komugi/strains/aboutNbrpMarker.jsp) and GrainGene website (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/maps.shtml) is not sufficient for high-resolution maps. Although SSR are the most popular marker system, the constructed map resolution remains low in plant species without a known genome sequence. An alternative marker system, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), has received considerable attention because it is the predominant class of genetic variation.23 High-throughput SNP-typing systems can be developed for organisms with a reference genome or comprehensive expressed sequence tag (EST) database, e.g. barley.24 But, in many plants having large and complex genomes and insufficient reference information, genome-wide SNP discovery is insufficient because of the presence of highly repetitive regions. In Ae. tauschii, an organism without a reference genome and composed of highly repetitive regions, annotation-based genome-wide SNP discovery has been developed to overcome these problems. In this strategy, Roche 454 shotgun reads with low genome coverage of one genotype were annotated, and then genomic and cDNA shotgun reads of another genotype were generated on SOLiD or Solexa platforms to identify putative SNPs. However, around 56% of the sequence length, characterized as a repetitive region, was excluded from the analysis.25In the present study, RNA-seq, a next generation sequencing technology for transcripts, was used as a cost-effective, simpler means of SNP discovery than annotation. SNPs, insertion/deletion polymorphisms (indels), and SSRs were discovered from de novo assembly data from ESTs of two Ae. tauschii accessions, PI476874 (L1) and IG47182 (L2), that were mapped on an SSR linkage map using an F2 population.26 We show that SNP markers can be developed in a chromosomal region of interest using the low-coverage genome sequence of wheat chromosome 7D27 or barley GenomeZipper results obtained from a synteny model conserved among barley, Brachypodium, rice, and sorghum.282. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material, RNA extraction, and next generation sequencingTwenty Ae. tauschii accessions from each sublineage were used (Table 1). Two Ae. tauschii accessions, PI476874 from the L1-2 sublineage and IG47182 from the L2-2 sublineage, were used for cDNA sequencing. Total RNA was isolated from leaves of 21-day-old seedlings using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). mRNA was isolated from 45 µg of RNA using an mRNA Purification Kit (Takara-Bio, Ohtsu, Japan). A 200 ng aliquot of mRNA was used to fragment the mRNA and synthesize cDNA from it using a cDNA Synthesis System (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Approximately 108 adapter-ligated cDNA molecules from the samples were used for library preparation using a GS FLX Titanium Rapid Library Preparation Kit (Roche Diagnostics). The library was sequenced with a GS FLX Titanium Sequencing Kit on a GS FLX System (Roche Diagnostics) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Files containing raw sequence data were deposited in the sequence read archive of the DNA Data Bank of Japan (accession number: DRA000536).

Assembly, SNP and indel discovery, and SSR miningAll reads from both accessions were pooled and de novo assembled with the GS de novo assembler algorithm (Newbler) version 2.6 (Roche Diagnostics) to generate reference contig sequences. During assembly, primer sequences and poly-A tails were trimmed from raw reads, and parameters of a minimum overlap length of 40 bp and minimum overlap identity of 90% were used. SNPs and indels were discovered by aligning all individual reads to the reference contig sequences using GS Reference Mapper version 2.6 (Roche Diagnostics). Only the accession-specific sequence variants (supported by at least two reads) were extracted as true polymorphisms from ‘All’ and ‘HC’ sequence differences produced by the GS Reference Mapper. SSR motifs within the reference contig sequences were identified by Sputnik software (http://espressosoftware.com/sputnik/index.html), and indels were searched for within these motifs to extract polymorphic SSRs.2.3. Gene annotation and analysis of synonymous and non-synonymous mutationsThe reference sequences were aligned with the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) non-redundant (nr) protein database and the Brachypodium distachyon (version 1.2, ftp://ftpmips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plants/brachypodium/v1.2), rice (RAP-DB, http://rapdb.dna.affrc.go.jp/), and wheat TriFLDB protein databases (http://trifldb.psc.riken.jp/index.pl) using BlastX with an E-value cutoff of 10-3. Gene ontology (GO) terms were assigned using Blast2GO29 and a locally installed database based on BlastX hits against the NCBI nr database.To study whether the discovered SNPs and indels affect amino acid sequences, the longest open reading frames (ORFs) of the isotigs that include all the 1793 contigs with high confidence (HC) polymorphism were extracted using EMBOSS.30 The isotigs without any BlastX result, described above, were excluded from analysis. Only the ORFs supported by the BlastX search were selected.2.4. SNP and SSR validationValidation of identified SNPs was performed through cleaved amplified polymorphic sequence (CAPS), derived CAPS (dCAPS), and high-resolution melting (HRM) methods. Gene-specific primer sequences, SNP locations, product length, and restriction enzymes are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. dCAPS primers were designed using the dCAPS Finder 2.0 program available on the website http://helix.wustl.edu/dcaps/dcaps.html.31 The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) conditions for CAPS and dCAPS markers were 1 cycle of 94°C for 2 min and 40 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 60°C (for CAPS) or 56°C (for dCAPS) for 30 s, and 68°C for 30 s. HRM analysis was performed using a LightCycler 480 Real-Time PCR System and LightCycler 480 HRM Master 2× reagents (Roche Diagnostics) according to our previous study.32 For HRM analysis, all samples were spiked with 10–50% of PI476874 DNA to facilitate discrimination of the homozygous genotype. All PCR products were checked on a 1.5% agarose gel to ensure the presence of a single band.SSR markers, depending on the indel length (see section 3.4), were amplified following the same conditions for CAPS markers or were analysed by HRM as described above. The polymorphic information content (PIC) was calculated using Excel Microsatellite toolkit add-in software.332.5. Comparison of HC SNPs and previously reported SNP datasetFor all of the 4337 HC SNPs, 100 bp sequences were extracted from 1748 contigs, positioning SNPs in the middle of the sequence. These sequences were BlastN searched against Ae. tauschii gene sequences with SNPs (E-value cutoff of 10 and gap extension penalty of 0) reported previously and published at http://avena.pw.usda.gov/wheatD/agsnp.shtml.252.6. Linkage map constructionA set of 104 F2 individuals derived from a cross between PI476874 and IG47182 was used as the mapping population. A total of 19 cfd, 21 barc, 17 wmc, 20 gwm, 8 gdm, and 2 hbg SSR markers (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/GG2/index.shtml, http://nics.naro.affrc.go.jp/team/dna_marker/) were assigned to each chromosome as anchor markers. A genetic map was constructed using MAPMAKER/EXP version 3.0b.34 The genetic distances were calculated with the Kosambi function.352.7. In silico mapping of contigs with HC SNPs on virtual barley chromosomesShotgun barley genomic reads mapped on the virtual barley chromosomes were extracted from flow-sorted chromosome reads submitted by Mayer et al.28 (accession number ERP000445). The tBlastX algorithm was used to align the 1793 contigs with extracted barley genomic reads and against a set of 5006 full-length cDNAs (accession numbers AK248134 to AK253139),36 and a set of 23623 full-length cDNAs (accession numbers AK353559 to AK377172),37 with an E-value cutoff of 10-1. The Blast search results obtained against Brachypodium and rice database were also used (see section 2.3).3. Results and discussion3.1. Sequencing and assembly of Ae. tauschii ESTsTo see how many SNPs could be discovered in one RNA-seq experiment between two phylogenetically distinct Ae. tauschii accessions, PI476874 and IG47182 (respectively from L1 and L2) were selected. The sequencing of leaf cDNA libraries produced 669 383 and 700 124 reads corresponding, respectively, to 247 Mb and 254 Mb per accession after trimming. All reads from both accession-derived libraries were assembled using Newbler 2.6. Newbler assembled reads into a contig representing transcript regions, isotigs (sets of contigs representing a partial or entire transcript), and isogroups (sets of isotigs). During the assembly process, Newbler constructed multiple alignments of overlapping reads and divided them into consistent sequences, i.e. contigs. Alignments that cannot be divided are collected as isogroups, and branching structures between them are searched by traversal paths through connected branches, i.e. isotigs (isotigs and isogroups are Newbler-specific terms). Different isotigs within the same isogroup represent alternative splicing variants. Thus, an isogroup represents genes, isoforms, or gene families. In this study, sequences shorter than 100 bp were excluded from the following analyses. A total of 10 224 contigs were assembled into 9145 isotigs (including some contigs that were not combined into isotigs), with a total of 7753 isogroups obtained. The length of the majority of contigs and isotigs ranged between 500 and 1000 bp, with an average of 786 and 1021 bp, respectively (Table 2). However, among isotigs, a sequence length as long as 11 328 bp was found (isotig02315), which showed sequence similarity to a Brachypodium distachyon E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase UPL1-like protein (XP_003575554.1, E-value = 0). Contig and isotig sequence length distributionContig and isotig sequence length distributionFor functional gene annotation, isotigs were reassembled to remove redundancy and to obtain longer transcripts using CAP3 with default parameter settings (90% identity and overlap of 40 bp)38 according to Ewen-Campen et al.39 Overall, 8895 assembled sequences were produced, and sequence similarity searches were conducted against the NCBI nr, rice, Brachypodium, and wheat protein databases using the BlastX algorithm. Of the query sequences, 90% had BlastX hits in the NCBI nr protein database. Similarly, 89 and 87% of the query sequences showed homology to annotated Brachypodium proteins and annotated rice proteins, respectively. On the other hand, 68% of the contig sequences had homology to wheat proteins, which might be due to the lower number of proteins deposited in the wheat database (8590 proteins) than the Brachypodium (31 029 proteins) and rice (40 353 proteins) databases.To see whether the sequenced transcripts are functionally diverse or not, GO annotation was performed based on the BlastX hits against the NCBI nr database. In total, 7740 sequences were assigned to one or more GO annotations. Of the assigned GO terms, 13 260 were under the biological process domain, 10 280 under molecular function, and 9750 under cellular component (Fig. 1). A large functional diversity of genes was found in the transcriptomic data. Because the total RNA for the transcriptome analysis was extracted from leaves, a large proportion of the assignments fell into the plastids category of the cellular component subontology. GO classification of assembled sequences. The results are summarized into three main subontologies: biological process, molecular function, and cellular component. Based on BlastX results against the NCBI nr protein database, 7740 sequences were assigned to one or more GO annotations.GO classification of assembled sequences.

SNP and indel discoveryPolymorphic sites were discovered using GS Reference Mapper to align individual reads from both accessions against the reference contig sequences. Among the 10 351 total polymorphic sites, 9435 were SNPs and 739 were indels (Table 3). Furthermore, according to the read depth (=3 non-duplicate reads) and quality (QV = 20), 4578 polymorphic sites were classified as HC polymorphisms, including 4337 SNPs (in 1748 contigs), 198 indels (in 153 contigs), and 44 variants with two or more nucleotide changes. The HC SNPs data are available online as Supplemental data (Supplemental Data1.fna). HC SNP frequency was one SNP per 1854 bp, and when considering all the discovered SNPs the frequency, it was 852 bp per SNP (Table 3). Polymorphisms detected between two Ae. tauschii accessionsaCalculated by dividing the total number of (HC) polymorphic sites or SNPs by the total length of contigs (8 039 509 bp).Polymorphisms detected between two Ae. tauschii accessionsaCalculated by dividing the total number of (HC) polymorphic sites or SNPs by the total length of contigs (8 039 509 bp).To study how many HC SNPs are also present in the polymorphism dataset reported by You et al.,25 a BlastN search was performed using as query 4337 100-bp sequences, in which each of the HC SNPs were positioned in the middle. Hits were obtained for all the 4337 sequences with an E-value cutoff of 10, of which 546 SNPs were common to our dataset (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). With an E-value cutoff of 10-5, 1943 hits were obtained, but the number of common SNPs between the two datasets did not differ greatly (538 SNPs). These results indicate that the majority of HC SNPs (around 3800) are only present in our dataset. Because the genome of Ae. tauschii is composed of large repetitive regions, only 44% of the total genomic read length has been available for SNP discovery.25 Our results indicate that SNP discovery by RNA-seq is cost-effective in organisms with complex genomes, as reported in maize.40Although most contigs with HC polymorphisms contained one or two HC SNPs, 41 contigs had a large number of SNPs, ranging from 11 to 44 (Fig. 2A). The number of SNPs per contig was not completely dependent on sequence length, indicated by the low coefficient of determination (R2 = 0.05) (Fig. 2B). To study whether these nucleotide variations affect amino acid sequences, the longest ORFs from isotigs that include contigs with HC polymorphisms were extracted. The longest ORFs supported by BlastX search were found in 1538 out of the 2214 isotigs. Synonymous and non-synonymous mutations were analysed on contig sequences. In about 1100 out of the 1379 selected contigs, nucleotide variations were found mainly within the ORF, whereas the number of SNPs was similar between the ORF and untranslated region (UTR) in around 80 contigs (Supplementary Table S4). Although the number of SNPs was higher in ORFs than in UTRs, synonymous mutations predominated in most cases. Non-synonymous mutations outnumbered synonymous ones in 370 contigs. Nonsense mutations were observed in four contigs. However, we cannot discharge the possibility that the reads of paralogous genes are included in these highly polymorphic contigs.

(A) Frequency distribution of HC SNPs per contig (n = 1748 contigs). (B) Relationship between the number of SNPs per contig and the contig length; data are from 1748 contigs containing SNPs. Significant correlation is indicated by asterisks (***P < 0.001). (C) Frequency distribution of HC indel length in base pairs per contig in a total of 153 contigs.The predominant length of indels was 3 bp, followed by 2, and 1 bp (Fig. 2C). The longest indel mutation was 11 bp in contig04102 and contig05280. Indels were found in 90 out of the 1379 analysed contigs (Supplementary Table S4), of which 45 contigs included indel mutations within ORF, and frame-shift mutations occurred in 16 contigs. These results indicate that, despite the high number of polymorphic sites, the effect on protein sequence is not necessarily high.3.3. SNP validationTo validate the detected SNPs, 33 polymorphic contigs were randomly selected. Of the 33 contigs, 30 contained HC SNPs and the remaining 3 contained lower confidence (LC) SNPs. The validation was performed by genotyping 20 diverse Ae. tauschii accessions, chosen based on the intraspecific diversification patterns of Ae. tauschii.12 The selected accessions consisted of two accessions from each of the nine Ae. tauschii sublineages (six of L1 and three of L2) and HGL17, excluding any admixtures (Fig. 3A).

PIC values of SNP markers (open bars) and SSR markers (black bars) among the 20 Ae. tauschii accessions. A total of 31 SNP and 6 SSR markers were used.First, all 33 contigs were searched for restriction enzyme recognition sites, with at least 14 SNPs found and converted into CAPS markers. All 14 CAPS markers were polymorphic among the examined accessions (Supplementary Fig. S1A). An alternative to a CAPS marker is a dCAPS marker that consists of the introduction of one or more mismatches into the primer, creating a restriction site dependent on the presence or absence of the SNP.41 Five of the SNPs that were not converted into CAPS markers were used to develop dCAPS markers by introducing one or two mismatches in the primer sequence. Two dCAPS markers could not be used for genotyping because unexpected bands were amplified by PCR, and a dCAPS marker for contig05220 was unavailable due to the generation of digestion-resistant PCR products in some accessions (Supplementary Fig. S1B). In dCAPS markers, a single mismatch at position 1, 2, or 3 from the 3' end of the primer is preferred to avoid digestion-resistant products.42 However, in some cases, a mismatch at position 1 or 2 may also lead to undigested products, if the polymerase has proofreading exonuclease activity.43 The digestion-resistant products were generated for unknown reasons because in the dCAPS analysis of the contig05220 marker, a single mismatch was introduced at position 1 and amplification was performed using a Taq DNA polymerase lacking proofreading activity. The remaining two dCAPS markers were successfully used in genotyping (Supplementary Fig. S1C).SNP genotyping based on HRM analysis has also been reported in hexaploid wheat and Ae. tauschii.32 Primers for HRM analysis were designed for the remaining 17 contigs (including the three contigs that failed in the dCAPS analysis) to obtain PCR products of ~100 bp. Only two of the 17 HRM primer sets failed in polymorphism detection, although both amplified genomic regions contained HC SNPs between PI476874 and IG47182. HRM analysis is useful as an alternative to SNP-typing because it is cost-effective when the restriction enzyme in CAPS/dCAPS markers is expensive. Another advantage of HRM is the possibility of detecting more than two alleles (Supplementary Fig. S2), which is not possible with CAPS/dCAPS. In addition, the relatively short length of the PCR products required for HRM analyses increases the probability that primer pairs are located within a single exon because more than half of the exons in plant genomes are less than 145–156 bp (Supplementary Table S5). Our results indicate that almost all of these SNPs can be converted to PCR-based molecular markers, at least in diploid wheat species.To evaluate the allelic diversity within the Ae. tauschii population, PIC values were calculated for each validated SNP marker. PIC values ranged from 0.091 to 0.591 (average, 0.313) in the 20 Ae. tauschii accessions (Fig. 3B). Among the 31 markers, three showed IG47182-specific SNP alleles, and 15 clearly distinguished the L1 accessions from L2 (Fig. 3A). Because many of the validated SNPs were polymorphic between L1 and L2 accessions, the markers developed using information about these SNPs can be used in genotyping of mapping populations obtained from interlineage crosses (L1 × L2). Moreover, considering that the subspecies strangulata is a possible major D-genome donor and the evolutionary birthplace of hexaploid common wheat, the D-genome donor has been thought to belong to L2,12 indicating that these markers might be useful for genotyping the progeny of common wheat cultivars crossed with L1-derived hexaploid wheat synthetics. Further studies are needed to confirm this hypothesis. The HGL17 accessions, considered one of the ancestral lineages of Ae. tauschii, are not included in either L1 or L2, but rather are located genealogically between these two lineages.12 Consistently, the genotype patterns of the two HGL17 accessions analysed (AE454 and AE929) were intermediates between L1 and L2 accessions.3.4. EST-SSR mining and validationAmong all 10 224 contigs, a total of 2778 SSR motifs were found in 2072 contigs and were composed mainly of trinucleotide motifs (Table 4). Indel polymorphisms between PI476874 and IG47182 were searched as polymorphic SSRs in the 2778 motifs. In total, 54 polymorphic SSRs were found in 50 contigs, with 20 of them HC SSRs. Based on these data, 18 EST-SSR markers, including 14 HC and 4 LC polymorphic SSRs, were developed for validation in the 20 Ae. tauschii accessions. Seven EST-SSR markers generated multiple bands or amplified products with a length much longer than expected (probably due to the presence of introns) and were excluded from further analyses. Four out of the eight EST-SSR markers with more than a 4-bp difference were able to distinguish genotypes of samples in 13% non-denaturing polyacrylamide gels. HRM analysis was conducted for the other EST-SSR markers, including indels with less than a 5-bp difference, and this detected polymorphisms in only two of the seven EST-SSR markers. PIC values of these six markers ranged from 0.305 to 0.686, with an average of 0.424 (Fig. 3B). The number of alleles in the EST-SSR markers ranged from two to six (average, 3.0), which was higher when compared with that in SNP markers with two to three alleles (average, 2.1). This difference might reflect the higher average PIC value of the EST-SSR markers. SSR motifs found in 10 224 contigsSSR motifs found in 10 224 contigs3.5. Genetic map constructionWe developed 37 polymorphic markers, including 31 SNPs and 6 EST-SSRs. To study the proportion of these markers that can be assigned to a genetic map, genotypes of 104 F2 individuals obtained from a cross between PI476874 and IG47182 were determined. All these markers were successfully mapped onto a linkage map constructed using 87 publicly available SSR markers.26,32 The total map length was 1282.1 cM, with an average interval of 9.5 cM between markers. In total, 12 markers were distorted on chromosome 1D, 24 markers on chromosome 2D, 6 markers on chromosome 4D, and 10 markers on chromosome 5D. Segregation ratios of the newly mapped markers are presented in Supplementary Table S6. The distribution of the 37 marker positions ranged from 1 on chromosome 1D to 12 on chromosome 5D (Supplementary Fig. S3). Two markers, one SNP marker and an SSR marker, were derived from different sites of contig06827, and both mapped to the same location.We performed a BlastN search of the 36 mapped contigs against the deletion-mapped ESTs of common wheat,44 obtaining 17 matches (Supplementary Table S7). Of the 17 contigs, 14 (82%) were located on the same homoeologous group chromosomes as the deletion-mapped ESTs. Recently, a genome survey sequence of common wheat chromosome 7D was published.27 To compare the order of the six contigs that mapped to chromosome 7D of Ae. tauschii, a BlastN search was performed against the 7D Synthetic Build v2.0.27 Four contigs were assigned to the short arm and two to the long arm of chromosome 7D, as expected based on the Ae. tauschii genetic map (Supplementary Table S8). The contig order in the survey sequence data was similar to that in the 7D linkage map, although the position of contig02996 differed slightly.In barley, a hypothetical gene order has been proposed for each of the seven chromosomes based on conserved synteny among barley, Brachypodium, rice, and sorghum.28 Due to the conserved synteny between wheat and barley,45 the contigs with HC SNPs were mapped on the virtual barley chromosomes, aligning with the shotgun barley genomic sequences.28 A total of 1450 contigs (E-value cutoff of 10-20) were mapped with a distribution of around 200 contigs per chromosome (Table 5). The order of contigs on the genetic map of chromosomes 2D and 5D was also compared, respectively, with the virtual barley chromosomes 2H and 5H. These two chromosomes were selected because the number of mapped contigs was higher than that for the remaining chromosomes. Of the seven contigs that mapped to chromosome 2D, one failed to be assigned to any barley chromosomes, four were assigned to chromosome 2H, and two to other chromosomes (Supplementary Table S9). To confirm this result, tBlastX search was performed against 5006 and 23 614 barley full-length cDNAs,36,37 and BlastX search was performed against Brachypodium and rice protein database. Based on these Blast hits, six out of the seven contigs were located on chromosome 2H (Supplementary Table S9), indicating that some homologous genes on the chromosome other than 2H were hit in the former analysis. Contig06577 failed to be assigned to any barley chromosome. The contig order on chromosome 2D of Ae. tauschii corresponded to the gene order on chromosome 2H of barley (Fig. 4A). Similarly, 12 out of 13 contigs of Ae. tauschii chromosome 5D were assigned to chromosome 5H of barley based on tBlastX hits against barley shotgun genomic reads (Supplementary Table S10). Contig05381 was assigned to chromosome 2H, and this result was confirmed by performing a Blast search against barley cDNA and Brachypodium and rice protein sequences (Supplementary Table S10). The contigs on chromosome 5D of Ae. tauschii, except for contig05398, showed an order identical to that on barley chromosome 5H, whereas contig05398 was located in a slightly different region (Fig. 4B). Previously, ~14% of barley genes could not be assigned to virtual chromosomes by the GenomeZipper approach.28 Therefore, contig06577 that failed to be assigned to the virtual barley chromosomes might correspond to the unassigned 14% of barley genes. Indeed, this contig showed sequence similarity with Brachypodium and rice genes Bradi1g19250 and Os07g0656700 that are probably located on the short arm of chromosome 2H, according to the synteny with barley (Supplementary Table S9). Furthermore, contig05381 (mapped on chromosome 5DL but assigned to barley 2HS) also showed sequence similarity with Bradi4g34390 and Os09g0502200 that probably map to chromosome 5HL of barley (Supplementary Table S10). The chromosomal locations of the remaining mapped contigs were similarly confirmed (Supplementary Table S11). These results suggest that the contigs should be assigned to virtual barley chromosomes not only by alignment with the shotgun genomic reads, but also by alignment with Brachypodium and rice protein sequences. The chromosomal locations of unassigned contigs might be searched based on the synteny among barley, Brachypodium, and rice. Our results indicate that information on hypothetical gene order in barley may be useful for the development of molecular markers in target chromosomal regions of wheat.

ConclusionMarker development in targeted chromosomal regions is important for map-based gene cloning and for molecular breeding in wheat and other crops. In this study, transcriptomes of two Ae. tauschii accessions belonging to different major lineages were compared, yielding 4578 HC-polymorphic sites from 1793 contigs. Thirty-one SNPs were validated in the 20 diverse Ae. tauschii accessions through conversion into CAPS, dCAPS, and HRM markers. Development of CAPS markers is dependent on the availability of appropriate restriction enzymes and their cost. In some dCAPS markers, generation of digestion-resistant PCR products interferes with precise genotyping. In this study, we showed that HRM analysis is available for SNP typing. The SNP markers developed in this study could be applied to construct an F2 map between L1 and L2 accessions of Ae. tauschii, and probably between the D genomes of common wheat and L1-derived synthetic wheat. One next generation sequencing experiment on transcriptomes of parental accessions leading to de novo-generated SNP markers was able to identify the chromosomal location of more than 1700 genes in the wheat D genome. RNA-seq is a more cost-effective method for SNP discovery than the annotation-based one in organisms with large and complex genomes. In addition, due to the conserved synteny between wheat and barley chromosomes, the barley high-density EST map and linear gene order can be applied to develop markers on the target chromosomal regions of wheat. Accompanied by further progress on the wheat genome project coordinated by the International Wheat Genome Sequencing Consortium (http://www.wheatgenome.org/), more information about genomic sequence data of each chromosome will become available for wheat marker development.Supplementary dataSupplementary Data are available atwww.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by grants from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology (MEXT) of Japan (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (B) No. 21380005 and Grant-in-Aid for Challenging Exploratory Research No. 23658010) to S.T., and by MEXT as part of a Joint Research Program implemented at the Institute of Plant Science and Resources, Okayama University in Japan.The authors would like to thank Ms Yuka Motoi at Okayama University for technical assistance.Supplementary data"
