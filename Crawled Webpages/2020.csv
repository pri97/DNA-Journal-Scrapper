IntroductionRadish (Raphanus sativus L.; 2n = 18) is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is closely related to Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea. Radish is grown as a vegetable crop around the world, and different plant organs in different shapes and sizes are consumed in various regions. For example, radish is consumed as a big long root in East Asia, small root in Europe and the USA, and immature edible seed pod in South and Southeast Asia.In recent years, many studies have been conducted on the radish genome. The whole genome sequence of radish has been determined and released by four research groups since 2014.1–4 In addition, several linkage maps have been constructed using various DNA markers such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms, amplified fragment length polymorphisms, random amplified polymorphic DNAs, simple sequence repeats (SSRs), cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences (CAPS), and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).5 A genetic map with 7,480 SNPs5 has been reported, in addition to a high-density linkage map with a total of 2,553 DNA markers, including SNPs, CAPS, and SSRs.2 These DNA polymorphisms and genome sequences serve as effective tools for the identification of loci and genes responsible for agronomic traits. For example, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting clubroot resistance,6,Fusarium wilt resistance,7 early bolting and flowering,8–10 and root glucosinolate content11,12 have been identified. Kakizaki et al.13 conducted map-based cloning using a mutant radish accession lacking glucoraphasatin, resulting in the discovery of a novel gene responsible for the synthesis of glucoraphasatin, which is not found in other Brassica species.Studies have also revealed genome-wide DNA polymorphisms among radish accessions. SNPs at 2,880 loci among eight accessions were identified using an amplicon sequencing method.2,12 Although the exact number of loci was unknown, a large number of genome-wide SNPs and insertions/deletions (Indels) were identified among 17 accessions via genome re-sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies.14 Furthermore, SSR polymorphisms have been determined at 52 loci among 93 radish accessions,15 although the number of DNA markers reported in this study was remarkably lower than those reported in the two aforementioned reports. More recently, advanced NGS methods have been developed for the identification of genome-wide SNPs such as restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq),16 double-digest RAD-seq (ddRAD-Seq),17,18 multiplexed inter-simple sequence repeat sequencing (MIG-seq),19 and genotyping by random amplicon sequencing-direct (http://newsroom.toyota.co.jp/en/detail/13715116, accessed 22 February 2020). These methods enable the analysis of several samples at once and therefore are expected to be a cost-effective and time-saving approach alternative to expensive NGS approaches.Cultivated radish accessions exhibit diverse morphological and physiological characteristics, and are taxonomically categorized as distinct varieties. For example, R. sativus var. sativus L. is a small radish cultivated mainly in the Occident (Europe, USA, and Mediterranean region) and Near East; R. sativus var. hortensis Becker is distributed in East Asia including Japan, China, and Korea, and is characterized by big and long taproots; R. sativus var. caudatus Hooker & Anderson produces an edible seed pod and is commonly called rat-tailed radish; R. sativus var. oleifer Metzg or var. chinensis Gallizioli is mainly used as an oilseed radish. Wild radish (R. sativus var. raphanistroides Makino) is native to the coast of Japan and Korea. Three wild species of the genus Raphanus are known, including Raphanus raphanistrum L., Raphanus maritimus Smith, and Raphanus landra Moretti ex DC.20,21 Knowledge of genome-wide DNA polymorphisms among these varieties and species could serve as a very valuable resource for the genetics and breeding of radish and for understanding the evolution of the genus Raphanus. Information on genome-wide SNPs among cultivars belonging to these varieties is expected to significantly advance the genetics and breeding of radish.In this study, we surveyed genome-wide SNPs in a larger collection of radish accessions (more than 500 cultivated and wild accessions) collected from East Asia, South and Southeast Asia, and the Occident and Near East using the ddRAD-Seq method. In addition, genetic diversity analyses were conducted using ~2,600 SNPs without missing data (hereafter referred to as common SNPs). Based on our results, we also discuss the origin of cultivated radish and its migration from the West to East Asia.2. Materials and methods2.1. MaterialsA total of 520 accessions were surveyed in this study (Supplementary Table S1). These accessions were obtained from the Tohoku University Brassica Seed Bank (http://www.agri.tohoku.ac.jp/pbreed/Seed_Stock_DB/SeedStock-top.html) and Genebank Project of NARO, or purchased from the market. According to the taxonomic classification (species and variety) and region of cultivation, these accessions were categorized into nine groups (Table 1): (i) Japanese landraces of R. sativus; (ii) R. sativus var. raphanistroides accessions collected from the Hokuriku area of Japan; (iii) R. sativus F1 cultivars bred in Japan; (iv) R. sativus accessions collected from East Asia (China, Korea, and Taiwan); (v) R. sativus accessions collected from South and Southeast Asia; (vi) R. sativus accessions collected from the Occident and Near East; (vii) R. raphanistrum accessions; (viii) R. maritimus accessions; and (ix) accessions from an unknown area. Summary of radish (Raphanus spp.) accessions used in this studySummary of radish (Raphanus spp.) accessions used in this study2.2. Genome sequencing and SNP detectionTo evaluate SNP heterogeneity in a single accession, leaves were sampled evenly from five to eight plants of each radish accession and ground to a fine powder. Genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, the Netherlands) and subjected to ddRAD-Seq analysis, as described previously.5,18 To perform ddRAD-Seq, DNA libraries of each accession were constructed using two restriction enzymes, PstI and MspI. The digested DNA fragments were ligated to adapters, and the ligated DNA samples were purified to eliminate short DNA fragments (<300 bp). The purified DNA samples were amplified by PCR using primers including index sequences.18 The resulting amplicons were pooled, and 300–900 bp DNA fragments were purified. The purified fragments were sequenced on the HiSeq2000 or HiSeq4000 (Illumina) platform to generate 93 or 101 bp paired-end reads. The data generated were submitted to the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA) database under the accession numbers DRA008624, DRA008625, DRA008636, and DRA008637. Low-quality sequences were removed, and adapters were trimmed using PRINSEQ (–trim_right 1 –trim_qual_right 10 –min_len 100 –derep) and fastx_clipper (–a AGATCGGAAGAGC –l 100 –M 10 –n) in the FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit; version 0.10.1). The filtered reads were mapped onto radish scaffold sequences (RSA_r1.0)2 using Bowtie 2 (version 2.1.0)22 using the following parameters: ––minins100 ––no-mixed. The resulting sequence alignment/map (SAM) format files were converted to binary sequence alignment/map format files and subjected to SNP calling using the mpileup option of SAMtools (version 0.1.19; parameter: –Duf)23 and the view option of BCFtools (parameter: –vcg). Heterozygous genotype calls might include the SNP heterogeneity in a single accession as well as heterozygous SNP genotypes. In both cases, it was meant that two different alleles existed in the accession. Variant call format (VCF) files were filtered using VCFtools (version 0.1.11; parameters: --max-alleles 2 --min-alleles 2 --minDP 5--minQ 999-- max-missing 0.5 --remove-indels)24 and then SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) =0.01 were extracted using TASSEL ver. 5.2.50.25 After excluding accessions with a low proportion of SNP sites (<40%), common SNPs were identified among the remaining 510 accessions (Supplementary Table S1) and counted.2.3. Genetic diversity analysis using common SNP sitesCommon SNPs (i.e. SNPs without missing data in all accessions including F1 cultivars) were converted to a biallelic representation, e.g. mix base code ‘M’ to single base ‘A’ and ‘C’ and code ‘A’ to ‘A’ and ‘A’, at all sites. The converted SNPs were subjected to principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and molecular phylogenetic analysis.Pairwise distance matrix was calculated by counting the total number of alleles identical between any two accessions using MEGA ver. 7.0.21.26 Using the obtained distance matrix, PCoA was conducted with the cmdscale function in the stats package of R ver. 3.5.0 (https://www.r-project.org). The results were presented in a chart using Microsoft Office Excel 2016 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, USA).Phylogenetic analysis for all accessions was conducted using the concatenated alignments of common SNP sites. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood method and Find Best DNA/Protein Model in MEGA version 7.0.21,26 with 1,000 bootstrap pseudo replicates.For construction of an outline tree, accessions were selected as evenly as possible in the original tree. In particular, accessions from ‘Kameido’, ‘Ninengo’, ‘Shigatsu’, ‘Shijunichi’, ‘Houryo’, ‘Miyashige’, ‘Shogoin’, ‘Awa Bansei’, ‘Nerima’, ‘Minowase’, and ‘Shiroagari’, which are Japanese traditional varietal groups, were included together with several major regional cultivars and several accessions from Nansei Islands (Rs2017_016, Rs2017_018, and Rs2017_201) and southwestern area of Japan, i.e. Kyushu area (Rs2017_142, Rs2017_148, and Rs2017_158).3. Results3.1. SNPs identified among 520 radish accessionsGenome sequencing of 520 radish accessions using the ddRAD-Seq method generated 56.9 Gb of data. A total of 76,598 SNPs was identified among these accessions. Of these 520 accessions, 510 accessions excluding 10 that included 8 accessions with a remarkably low proportion of SNP sites (<40%) [Rs2017_065 (Takakura), Rs2017_073 (Bansei Miura), Rs2017_081 (Mera Daikon), Rs2017_089 (Kuroba Soubutori Minowase), Rs2017_204 (Kijikashira), Rs2017_317 (Tibet Kougen Daikon), Rs2017_323 (Everest), and Rs2017_445 (PAK-10445)] (Supplementary Table S1) and two accessions of unknown origin (Rs2017_458 and Rs2017_459) were used for further analyses. Among the remaining 510 accessions, 52,559 SNPs with MAF =0.01 were identified (Supplementary Table S2). We calculated the ratio of obtained SNP sites in each accession relative to the total number of SNP sites (52,559) (Supplementary Table S3). The average value of this ratio was 80.2%, although it ranged from 44.4% to 95.4%.The 52,559 SNPs were located on 5,138 scaffolds of RSA_r1.0.2 Of these 5,138 scaffolds, 903 scaffolds containing 19,114 SNP sites (highlighted in green in Supplementary Table S2) were mapped onto the high-density R. sativus restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (Rs-RAD) genetic map constructed by Shirasawa and Kitashiba5 (Supplementary Fig. S1). The mapped SNPs were distributed on nine linkage groups (Rs1–9), with 1,285–3,054 SNPs per linkage group (Table 2). In addition, 2,624 common SNP sites were identified among 510 accessions (highlighted in yellow in Supplementary Table S4). The common SNP sites were also distributed across each linkage group, with 76–244 SNPs per linkage group (Table 2). Number of SNPs mapped onto the Rs-RAD-based genetic map5 in each of the nine linkage groups (Rs1–9)SNPs mapped on to the Rs-RAD genetic map out of the total 52,559 SNPs identified in this study.SNPs mapped on to the Rs-RAD genetic map out of 2,624 common SNPs identified in this study.Number of SNPs mapped onto the Rs-RAD-based genetic map5 in each of the nine linkage groups (Rs1–9)SNPs mapped on to the Rs-RAD genetic map out of the total 52,559 SNPs identified in this study.SNPs mapped on to the Rs-RAD genetic map out of 2,624 common SNPs identified in this study.The ratio of a single homozygous allele to the total number of common SNP sites was calculated for each accession. This ratio was 76.0% on average and varied from a maximum of 97.0% in Rs2017_266 (Ankiku 1) to a minimum of 58.1% in Rs2017_413 (Shiromaru) (Supplementary Table S3). Among the radish populations of Japan without F1 cultivars (n = 263), East Asia (n = 88), South and Southeast Asia (n = 23), and the Occident and Near East (n = 56), the ratios of homozygous allele to the total number of common SNP sites were 75.9%, 75.3%, 68.8%, and 72.6%, respectively (Supplementary Table S5).Of the 2,624 common SNP sites, 2,262 (86.2%) were detected among Japanese R. sativus accessions. SNPs of 2,034 (77.5%), 2,122 (80.9%), 2,498 (95.2%), 2,283 (87.0%), and 1,770 (67.5%) were detected among R. sativus accessions from East Asia, South and Southeast Asia, and the Occident and Near East and among R. raphanistrum and R. maritimus accessions, respectively. In addition, the Japanese population shared 5,850 sites of the total 52,559 SNP sites, without missing sites, and SNPs were identified at 5,046 sites.A survey of nucleotide substitution patterns in 510 radish accessions showed that the number of transitions (1,554) was higher than that of transversions (1,070), and the ratio of transitions to transversions was 1.45. This ratio was almost the same as that reported previously among 17 Raphanus accessions14 and similar to that reported in Brassica napus (1.39), but quite different from that reported in B. rapa (1.0).273.2. Genetic diversity analysisPCoA was conducted using the common SNP sites identified among 510 accessions. Scores indicated by the first and second components (24.3% of the cumulative variance) for each sample were plotted on a chart (Fig. 1a). Although the 510 accessions were widely scattered on the chart, they could be grouped into four populations (clades): population A (R. sativus landraces and F1 cultivars, and R. sativus var. raphanistroides accessions mainly from Japan), population B (R. sativus landraces mainly from East Asia), population C (R. sativus landraces mainly from South and Southeast Asia), and population D (R. sativus landraces mainly from the Occident and Near East as well as R. raphanistrum and R. maritimus accessions). Another PCoA of 372 Asian accessions, excluding F1 cultivars from Japan, revealed three populations (A, B, and C) (Fig. 1b) similar to those shown in Fig. 1a. PCoA of radish accessions using common SNPs. PCoA of 510 accessions (a) and 372 Asian accessions (b).PCoA of radish accessions using common SNPs. PCoA of 510 accessions (a) and 372 Asian accessions (b).Phylogenetic analyses of 510 accessions were conducted using the common SNP sites with the maximum likelihood method. The GTR+G model was determined as the best nucleotide substitution model in MEGA7. Phylogenetic tree constructed using common SNPs among all 510 accessions is shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. An outline tree was reconstructed using the SNPs of 81 accessions enclosed by rectangles as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2 (Fig. 2).The examined Raphanus accessions were divided into five clades (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Fig. 2). Clade 1 included accessions mainly categorized as population A in Fig. 1a. Clades 2 and 3 included accessions of populations B and C, respectively, shown in Fig. 1a. Clade 4 consisted of R. sativus accessions mainly from the Occident and Near East. Clade 5 included accessions of the wild species, R. raphanistrum and R. maritimus. Interestingly, clades 1 and 2 were separated from clade 3 with a high bootstrap value. Clade 2 was subdivided into two sub-clades (2-1 and 2-2). The clade 2-1 consisted of accessions mainly from south area of East Asia including Taiwanese accessions, Rs2017_312, Rs2017_313, and Rs2017_314. On the other hand, accessions of the north area including northern part of China and Korea were included in clade 2-2. Phylogenetic tree of 81 representative radish accessions constructed using the maximum likelihood method.Phylogenetic tree of 81 representative radish accessions constructed using the maximum likelihood method.Next, we examined the coverage of 2,624 common SNP sites among the 81 accessions. Of the 2,624 common SNPs, 1,790 (68.2%) were detected in the Japanese clade. When landraces from other clades were added, the coverage of SNPs increased to 75.9% (clade 1 + clade 2) and 80.2% (clade 1 + clade 2 + clade 3). Drastic increases in SNP coverage were observed in groups comprising clades 1–4 (98.1%) and clades 1–5 (99.0%). In addition, these 81 accessions shared 5,211 sites of the total SNP sites (52,559), without missing data, and SNPs at most of the sites (98.8%) were detected.4. Discussion4.1. Large number of SNPs from geographically diverse radish accessionsTo date, nucleotide polymorphisms among radish accessions have been analysed in several studies. Shen et al.28 identified 28,758 SNPs among 18 radish accessions, based on the analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) available in the NCBI database of ESTs. Kim et al.14 revealed a total of 4,033,588 SNPs and Indels among 17 radish accessions using their own re-sequencing data and publicly available genome sequence information, although the number of the polymorphic sites was not reported. From the viewpoint of the number of radish accessions, Wang et al.15 reported DNA polymorphisms among 93 radish accessions using 559 EST–SSR markers. Previously, we detected 17,341 SNPs among seven accessions from Japan and one accession from Southeast Asia.2,12 In the present study, we identified SNPs in a much larger collection of radish accessions with a wide geographical distribution and diverse morphological features and end uses (phenotypic data are available in Genebank project, NARO). While 52,559 SNP sites were identified among 510 radish accessions, the total number of SNPs among 510 accessions was estimated as 21,444,072 SNPs (52,559 sites × 0.80 [average ratio of the obtained SNP sites] × 510 accessions). Thus, our study adds valuable SNP information to the databases described above, in terms of both the number of SNPs and number of accessions. We have also constructed a new URL (http://radish.kazusa.or.jp), where comprehensive SNP data will be publicly available.Previously, amplicon sequencing2 and genome re-sequencing14 approaches were used to detect genome-wide SNPs in radish. Recently, ddRAD-Seq has proven to be highly effective for the detection of genome-wide SNPs. In tomato, a large number of SNPs (19,969) were identified between two inbred lines18 and used for the construction of a genetic map. The ddRAD-Seq method has also been used to detect SNPs in other crops, such as sweet potato, sweet cherry, and ornamental cherry29–31 and to produce a high-density genetic map in radish.5 Moreover, this technique successfully detected a large number of genome-wide SNPs in several radish accessions in the present study. These data suggest that the ddRAD-Seq is one of the most effective tools for genome analysis.4.2. Genetic diversity in the genus RaphanusPCoA identified four populations (A–D; Fig. 1a) among the 510 radish accessions examined in this study. Clades 1–3 detected by phylogenetic analysis almost exactly corresponded to populations A, B, and C detected by PCoA, respectively. Accessions in clade 4 were present in population D. Therefore, according to the results of genetic analyses, R. sativus accessions were grouped into four populations. These four populations showed a strong association with their geographic distribution; (i) Japan, (ii) China and Korea, (iii) South and Southeast Asia, and (iv) the Occident and Near East. According to plant morphology and end uses, R. sativus is further categorized into several varieties, such as var. sativus, var. niger, var. caudatus, and var. hortensis.20,21 Most of the European small radishes and black radishes are categorized as R. sativus var. sativus and var. niger, respectively.20,21 In the present study, both varieties were included in population D detected by PCoA. Rat-tailed radish cultivated in South and Southeast Asia is categorized as R. sativus var. caudatus,20,21 and most of the accessions belonging to var. caudatus were included in population C. Most of the big radishes including thick taproot, large taproot, long taproot, and round taproot found in East Asia and Japan were categorized as R. sativus var. hortensis. Most accessions of R. sativus var. hortensis used in this study were included in either population A or population B. Thus, genetic diversity in radish accessions showed a strong relationship with the variety and geographical distribution.4.3. Origin and migration of cultivated radishAmong the five clades detected by phylogenetic analysis, four clades comprised cultivated radish accessions, while one clade comprised wild radish species such as R. raphanistrum and R. maritimus. In addition, cultivated radish was separated from the wild species (Fig. 2). A similar result was reported by Wang et al.15 in a study on 93 radish accessions and 50 SSR markers. Although the number of samples examined by Shen et al.28 and Kim et al.14 was limited (<22 samples), phylogenetic analysis in these studies also showed similar divergence of cultivated radish from wild species. These results suggest that cultivated radish species were derived either from one of the wild Raphanus species (R. raphanistrum, R. maritimus, or another wild species) or from a common ancestor of the genus Raphanus. Furthermore, since wild Raphanus species are thought to have originated in the Mediterranean region,32 it would be reasonable to speculate that cultivated radish (R. sativus) also originated around the same area.It remains unclear how cultivated radish transferred from the West to East Asia. One possibility, as suggested by Kitamura,32 Huh and Ohnishi,33 and Wang et al.,34 is that the cultivated species (R. sativus) originated in the Mediterranean region and migrated towards the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, and then further to the East, i.e. East Asia, along a certain road such as the Silk Road. During migration, new varieties such as var. caudatus and var. hortensis probably originated, and then migrated to and domesticated in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia (Fig. 3a, hypothesis-a). Furthermore, R. sativus var. hortensis is thought to have been transported to Japan via Southern China. Possible migration route of cultivated Raphnanus species from the West to East Asia. (a) Conventional hypothesis, based on previous studies. (b) Proposed hypothesis, based on the results of this study. Arrow means direction of the migration.Possible migration route of cultivated Raphnanus species from the West to East Asia. (a) Conventional hypothesis, based on previous studies. (b) Proposed hypothesis, based on the results of this study. Arrow means direction of the migration.However, our results of phylogenetic analysis and PCoA led us to another hypothesis (Fig. 3b, hypothesis-b). Populations A–D detected by PCoA corresponded almost exactly to the phylogenetic clades 1–4. Based on the results of phylogenetic analysis, cultivated Raphanus species in the Asian group are inferred to have diverged from those in the Western group. Within the Asian group, the ancestors of East Asian and Japanese groups are inferred to have diverged from the South and Southeast Asian group. In the East Asian group, ancestral cultivars of some present accessions such as Rs2017_359, _360 and _361 in the southern area diverged from those in the South and Southeast Asian group. Furthermore, it is deduced that a part of the ancestral cultivars spread in southern area, while another part of the ancestral ones, which might have acquired cold tolerance possibly due to increase in genetic variation, migrated to the northern area. In addition, within the Japanese group, radish accessions in southwestern Japan (Nansei Islands), e.g. Rs2017_016, and in Kyushu area, e.g. Rs2017_158, diverge from those in the South and Southeast Asian group and then the others of mainland diverge. This implies that a part of ancestral cultivated varieties of the South and Southeast Asian group migrated towards the main island of Japan through southwestern area of Japan. Meanwhile, genetic variation might increase due to nucleotide substitutions and/or crosses between different cultivars. In summary, it is suggested that the cultivated species, R. sativus, originated in the West and migrated to the South and Southeast Asia, although a part of the cultivated species may have migrated further east from the West as suggested by Kitamura32 (a broken grey arrow, in Fig. 3b). Furthermore, those probably spread independently to area in China and to area in Japan from South and Southeast Asia (Fig. 3b; hypothesis-b).In the analyses of mitochondrial DNA, five different haplotypes of the cox1–orfB region detected among wild radish species have also been observed among populations from three different areas: Europe, Asia including China, Korea, and countries of the Southeast Asia, and Japan.35 However, the observed haplotypes showed a strong association with the geographical areas. For example, the European population contained one haplotype, whereas Asian populations contained four to five haplotypes. In addition, haplotypes within the Asian populations showed different frequencies,35 indicating that radishes were domesticated in the respective areas; this is supported by the results of a similar analysis of chloroplast genes.36 In addition, phylogenetic analysis of the chloroplast trnK/matK region conducted by Lü et al.21 indicated that three kinds of cultivated radishes, including European small radish, Asian big radish, and black radish, belong to different clusters, suggesting that the domestication of cultivated radish occurred independently in the respective areas. To further understand the route of migration of radishes in more detail, haplotype analyses of mitochondrial or chloroplast genes are needed in a large number of geographically diverse accessions.In genetic analyses such as QTL analysis and genome-wide association study, genetic distance between cultivars greatly affects the efficiency of analysis. A high degree of DNA polymorphisms among cultivars is expected to discover trait-associated loci or genes at a high resolution. SNP data revealed in this study will facilitate the selection of cultivars based on genetic analysis. Furthermore, SNP-related information will enable the production of DNA markers for the accurate identification of cultivars and will greatly contribute to the genetic analyses and breeding of radish cultivars.We thank Ms Marina Mitsui for assistance with growing plants and DNA extraction.

IntroductionRestriction–modification (R–M) systems are an essential part of the bacterial defense against invading DNA.1–5 The components of these systems, an endonuclease (REase) and a methyltransferase (MTase), work to either cleave or protect DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Given their opposing roles, it is reasonable to postulate that gene expression or other biochemical mechanisms have evolved to balance the activities of the MTase and the REase inside a host.6–12 Maintenance of an optimal balance is crucial for the integrity of the genome, the survival of the cell and the stability of the R–M system within a host. To avoid methylation of the incoming DNA before its restriction, it is essential that a potent anti-phage defense system is well established with optimal regulation within a narrow window of flexibility. The relationships between the strength of the antiviral defense and the cellular level of R–M protein production remain to be fully characterized. Regulatory control of R–M system gene expression favors relatively low levels of REase and MTase,13 and the REase is often under additional controls (dedicated controlling protein, regulatory MTase, or antisense RNAs) to prevent becoming toxic to the host.9The role of the R–M system in the context of a cell is not fully defined, and little is known about the possible impacts of aberrant DNA cleavage on host genome integrity. There seem to be critical moments during the cell cycle; otherwise, some regions of the host chromosome may become vulnerable to residual REase.12,14–17 R–M systems can be horizontally transferred between various genomes,18–22 and the effects of unbalanced expression are especially dramatic when the newly acquired R–M system is being established in a host with unprotected genome.20,23–28 Cell death during this period remains high unless the R–M system gene expression regulation reaches a fine-tuned balance facilitating survival. Proper balance is also critical for cell vitality during the loss of R–M genes, as the gradual decrease in modification activity leaves the chromosome exposed to restriction. This effect is lethal for the majority of cells.15,16,29–31 It is, therefore, not surprising that some R–M gene complexes are recognized as self-mobilizable elements.31–33In this study, we used the EcoRI R–M system of Escherichia coli as a model34–38 to study the relationship between ecoRIR and ecoRIM expression levels and test the factors of the optimal balance of their enzymatic activities. Originally, the genes of the EcoRI R–M system were discovered on a pMB1 plasmid located close to the highly site-specific recombinogenic cer site. Following the concerted action of XerCD and other accessory proteins, this region might serve as the multimer resolution crossover site for many cer-like sequence homologues.39–42 This region also contributes to Xer-independent dimer formation, but at very low frequencies.43 Previous studies reported that EcoRI R–M systems carried by ColE1-type plasmid derivatives are sometimes functionally unstable and result in a variety of R–M system phenotypes.44–47 Notably, the phenotypic alterations of the EcoRI R–M systems could not be attributed to simple insertion or deletion changes and the actual mechanism responsible for the observed conversion remains unknown (e.g. phenotypically cryptic restriction activity, which is not functional in vivo but is detectable after extraction from the same cells).45 Reported here analysis of the EcoRI R–M system in several plasmid backgrounds carried on P15A replicon derivatives48 revealed a range of restriction activity phenotypes (high, low, and completely abolished). Our results have provided a framework for understanding the previously observed phenotypic instabilities, by linking the disruption of the restriction/modification balance to changes in R–M operon gene expressions that appear to be the result of the R–M system’s close proximal genetic context. We propose that shaping of the functional diversity of R–M systems may likely be a consequence of the cycles of establishment events that occur in new hosts once the genes have been horizontally transferred. Our data provided further insights into Type II R–M system maintenance and the potential conflict within the host bacterium.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains and plasmidsEscherichia coli K-12 strains used in this work are presented in Table 1. Escherichia coli cells were grown in LB medium with antibiotics at the following concentrations when necessary: ampicillin (Ap) at 100 µg/ml, chloramphenicol (Cm) at 30 µg/ml, and tetracycline (Tc) 15 µg/ml. Isopropyl ß-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and l-arabinose (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as indicated in the experiments. Plasmids were introduced into chemically competent cells by a standard procedure.49 Their relevant features are presented in Supplementary Table S1 as well as information on their construction using oligonucleotides in Supplementary Table S2. Escherichia coli strains used in this workEscherichia coli strains used in this work2.2. Growth competition assayEscherichia coli MG1655 strains bearing or lacking the EcoRI R–M system were grown from single colonies. To quantitate the initial number of bacteria (CFU/ml) used for inoculation of a mixed culture, each strain was serially diluted and spread on LB plates. Each pair of the examined strains (MG1655, as a negative control without any Type II R–M systems) was also mixed at a 1:1 cell number ratio and diluted 1:50 into 10 ml of fresh LB without antibiotics. Each overnight co-culture (16–18 h at 37 °C) was then diluted 104 into fresh LB medium. The cycle of consecutive dilutions and growth of mixed cultures was repeated twice. Finally, each mixed competition culture was sampled, diluted, and spread quantitatively onto LB agar containing chloramphenicol and onto antibiotic-free LB agar plates. The colonies were counted and the ratio of cells carrying plasmids to the total number of cells was determined for each of the tested co-cultures.2.3. Phage restriction assayThe restriction activity of E. coli cells carrying the ecoRIR gene was measured by determining the efficiency of plating of phage <U+03BB>vir, which has four EcoRI sites50 and is unable to form lysogens. All experiments were conducted with freshly transformed cells. Serial dilutions of <U+03BB>vir phage in TM (10 mM MgSO4 and 100 mM NaCl) buffer were prepared from 1 to 108 cells. In the qualitative assay, 3 ml top agar preheated to 44 °C with 300 µl bacterial culture was poured on the LA bottom layer. Ten microliters of each serial dilution of a phage lysate was then spotted onto the top of the agar and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The quantitative assay involved a mixture of the appropriate phage dilution (100 µl) and host bacteria (10–300 µl, at OD600 = 0.6) and was incubated for 20 min at room temperature, then 3 ml of the top agar was added, mixed, and then poured onto the LA bottom layer. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The efficiency of plaque formation was calculated as the number of plaque-forming units (PFUs) obtained on bacteria with the tested plasmid divided by the number of PFUs on bacteria with the pACYC184 plasmid. Relative restriction (=1) denoted the EcoRI R–M system carried out on the pIM-RM plasmid.2.4. Quantitative real-time PCR analysisThree milliliters of E. coli ER1992 cells containing EcoRI R–M plasmids was harvested during exponential growth. The cells were centrifuged, then the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of StayRNA reagent to prevent RNA degradation (A&A Biotechnology, Gdynia, Poland). The total cellular RNA was extracted using the Total RNA Mini Plus Kit (A&A Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After elution, the RNA was treated with DNase I for 60 min at 37 °C (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and then at 65 °C for 15 min to inactivate the enzyme. The RNA was then used as a template for first-strand cDNA synthesis using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Three sets of primers (Supplementary Table S2) were used to estimate transcripts levels of ecoRIR, ecoRIM, and a housekeeping gene (16S rrn). Primers were designed to avoid regions involved in regulatory circuits.35,36 Each qPCR reaction (10 µl) contained 5 µl SG qPCR Master Mix (2×) with SYBR Green I fluorescent dye, Perpetual Taq DNA polymerase, and dNTPs (Eurx, Gdansk, Poland), 3 µl H2O, 1 µl of 5 µM forward and reverse primer mix, and 1 µl of diluted cDNA as a template. The qPCR was conducted using a Roche Lightcycler (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) using the following conditions: a predenaturation step at 94 °C for 3 min and 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50 °C for 30 s, and polymerization at 72 °C for 20 s. The expected product lengths were 172, 170, and 170 bases for ecoRIR, ecoRIM, and 16S rrn, respectively. Biological triplicates were taken for each sample and the qPCR was independently repeated at least twice. Melting curve analysis was conducted to confirm the formation of the expected products. The quantitative model included the PCR efficiency for each cDNA and was obtained by serially diluting it and then plotting the Ct values against cDNA input to generate a slope.51,52 We observed high linearity (R2 > 0.98) for all measurements.3. ResultsWe noticed a substantial variation in DNA restriction, using a <U+03BB> phage plaque assay in the same E. coli host strain that carried several EcoRI R–M plasmids (Fig. 1A). The EcoRI R–M system located on the pACYCeco plasmid showed significantly higher phage restriction (similar to the pMB1-related NTP14 plasmid),47 in comparison to the system carried by the pIM-RM plasmid of the same P15A replicon (Supplementary Fig. S1).35,53 The differences were ~1,300-fold between these two plasmids, and 1,900-fold comparing the plasmid and chromosomal ecoRIRM locations (Fig. 1A). Notably, the nucleotide sequences of both systems were identical, and the promoter regions, consisting of the main PR promoter embedded within the binding elements of the Xer/cer recombination system and including Pcer promoter,36,54–56 were also very close in sequence. The differences involved the orientation of the EcoRI R–M operon with respect to the chloramphenicol gene and the presence of a weak constitutive promoter PL1 from the <U+03BB> bacteriophage,53,57 which was coupled to the <U+03BB> nutL anti-terminator (Fig. 2). Western blot analysis of the REase and MTase for both strains showed that high expression of the R–M system was not correlated with the observed antiviral activity (Fig. 1A vs. 1B). Paradoxically, plasmid pACYCeco, which confers high relative restriction, produced much less REase (below the level of detection in this assay) than the systems located on the pIM-RM plasmid or on the control plasmid, where the EcoRI MTase and REase enzymes were overproduced upon arabinose induction (Fig. 1B). We then sought to understand the basis for this highly varied expression and the lack of correspondence between REase levels and degree of restriction. Phage restriction variation in Escherichia coli cells carrying the EcoRI R–M system measured as phage <U+03BB>vir infection efficiency. (A) The qualitative assay involved 5 µl of serial dilutions of <U+03BB>b2vir phage, which were spotted onto LB agar plates with an E. coli ER1992 lawn carrying the indicated plasmids or no plasmids [ER1992E (EcoRI R–M)+ strain] and incubated overnight at 37 °C.

The names of plasmid constructs and modified promoters are given.3.1. The enhanced restriction phenotype was not due to N/nutL anti-terminationIt was possible that R–M system expression may be affected during <U+03BB> phage infection when the N anti-terminator protein was supplied, and this could cause for the high restriction pattern observed in the pACYCeco construct (nutL anti-terminator upstream of PR) (Fig. 2). To address this possibility, we provided N gene expression from the arabinose-inducing promoter of the pBAD-N vector (Supplementary Table S1) and measured the relative level of ß-galactosidase reporter inserted downstream of the nutL site (pACYClacZ) (Supplementary Table S1). We observed up to a 3.3-fold increase in ß-galactosidase activity when the N protein was present (Fig. 1C), which was in agreement with other reports detailing the effects of N protein on transcription.58,59We also used a time course to measure the kinetics of R.EcoRI production during <U+03BB> phage infection when the N protein was supplied by its natural source. We found higher levels of R.EcoRI protein in the <U+03BB> phage-infected bacteria when compared with the uninfected control cells (Fig. 1D). These results confirmed that REase levels were slightly higher when the anti-termination process was active, but the levels were still significantly lower than those produced in the pIM-RM background (Fig. 1C). We inactivated the weak tL0 terminator accompanying the nutL region58 in pACYCeco to produce pACYC<U+0394>nutL (Fig. 2; Supplementary Table S1), and, as expected, both the REase level (Fig. 1B, lane 5 vs. lane 2) and the relative restriction (phage assay, data not shown) remained unchanged. Consistent with this possibility was the observation of a 2-fold increase in LacZ activity when the reporter was cloned downstream of PL1 (pACYC<U+0394>nutLacZ; Supplementary Table S1) relative to the nutL-tL0 bearing pACYClacZ (Fig. 1C). These results indicated that the N/nutL elements were likely not responsible for the two distinct phenotypes observed for relative restriction (pACYCeco vs. pIM-RM).3.2. Additional upstream transcription for the EcoRI operon was responsible for the difference in restriction efficiencyWe next asked whether the observed differences in restriction efficiency might simply be due to varied ecoRIRM expressions in both plasmids. We designed lacZ translational fusions for the ecoRIR and ecoRIM genes, making sure that the EcoRI regulatory antisense RNAs were preserved.35 For the ecoRIM::lacZ fusion, the REase gene was first mutated, avoiding transcriptional polarity effects, but preventing active REase from being produced. A restriction-deficient REase mutant (Lys113Ala) was generated as previously reported.60 LacZ activity was measured for the two translational fusion constructs, ecoRIM::lacZ and ecoRIR::lacZ in both pIM-RM and pACYCeco derivatives (Fig. 3A). The results for fusions under their constitutive expression showed that both derivatives of pIM-RM had ~5-fold higher gene expression than the pACYCeco-derived plasmids (Fig. 3B; pIM-RMlacZR vs. pACYClacZR and pIM-RMlacZM vs. pACYClacZM). Quantitative RT-PCR of total RNA from cells carrying pACYCeco and pIM-RM was used to confirm the ecoRIR and ecoRIM transcript levels. As expected, higher levels (~14-fold for ecoRIR and 10-fold for ecoRIM) of the EcoRI operon expression for pIM-RM were observed when compared with pACYCeco (Fig. 3C). Quantitative densitometric analysis revealed 2-fold molar excess of M.EcoRI protein over R.EcoRI in early stationary phase for cells carrying pIM-RM. In addition, we cloned the araBAD promoter upstream of the PR promoter of the EcoRI operon (pACYCara plasmid; Fig. 2) to determine whether a strong upstream transcriptional signal might interfere with the two regulatory circuits responsible for the fine-tuned restriction/modification gene expression balance.35,36 Such constructs with lacZ reporter fused to ecoRIR and ecoRIM (pACYCecoARAlacZR and pACYCecoARAlacZM, respectively) generated EcoRI operon overexpression after arabinose induction [Fig. 3A (in brackets) and B]. Our results with pACYCara-based expression clearly showed that high operon induction was associated with lower relative restriction (<U+03BB>vir plaque formation) (Figs 3B and 4B), confirming the earlier results obtained for pBAD-RM construct (Fig. 1A and B, Supplementary Fig. S2). The EcoRI R–M expression level generated by pACYCeco and pIM-RM plasmid constructs. The LacZ reporter gene was used to construct translational fusions with ecoRIR endonuclease (pACYClacZR, pIM-RMLacZR, and pACYCecoARAlacZR) and ecoRIM methyltransferase (pACYClacZM, pIM-RMLacZM, and pACYCecoARAlacZM) genes.

ECL chemiluminescence with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG was used to visualize the products. Culture samples were normalized by OD600. (B) PFUs of the previously mentioned plasmid-bearing bacteria.We reasoned that the only possible source of upstream transcription for the EcoRI operon in the pIM-RM plasmid was the constitutive promoter for the cat gene. Indeed, deletion of the cat promoter in pIM-RM or replacement with a DNA cassette carrying the kanamycin resistance gene (pIM-RMkan) restored a high phage restriction phenotype that was comparable to pACYCeco (Supplementary Table 3) by decreasing R–M expression (data not shown). A similar effect was obtained after transfer of ecoRIRM operon from pIM-RM to pBR322-derivative plasmid (data not shown).3.3. A higher REase production was associated with R–M system instability and SOS response inductionNext, we tested whether high (pIM-RM) or low (pACYCeco) levels of ecoRIR gene expression differentially affected the bacterial SOS response. We examined the cells by microscopy and found high levels of filamentation, a typical result of the SOS response.61,62 Filamentation was seen only for cells with the pIM-RM plasmid, but not for pACYCeco (Fig. 5A). To measure this phenomenon quantitatively, we used SOS-gfp/yfp reporter strains and found the levels of fluorescence to be high for cells carrying pIM-RM (Fig. 5B). Escherichia coli with pACYCeco or its derivatives, pACYCp and pACYCcer, did not show a similar effect (data not shown). These results indicated that the autorestriction of host DNA resulting from elevated cellular REase concentrations likely contributed to substantial SOS induction. We further measured the impact of REase regulation on cell viability by mixing an equal number of cells; an isogenic R-deficient strain (no plasmid) with the R-proficient strains (pACYCeco or pIM-RM), and then performed long-term competition assays. The mixed cultures were grown in rich media without antibiotic selection, and cell ratios were measured immediately at the start of growth and then again after ~60 generations. The strain carrying pIM-RM showed a significant decrease in cell viability when mixed with the restriction deficient control, when compared with the relatively balanced growth stability exhibited by the pACYCeco and plasmid (pIM27 R-M+) control strains (Fig. 5C). The SOS response induction and R–M system instability in cells carrying the plasmid with the high R–M genes expression. (A) Escherichia coli strain SS996, where the gfp gene is under the control of the PsulA promoter, was transformed with the following plasmids: pIM-RM (high R–M genes expression), pACYCeco (low R–M genes expression) and pBAD-RM, where REase expression was induced by 0.04% of l-arabinose for 2 h. Light and fluorescence microscopy images were captured. (B) The SOS response was also measured quantitatively for the same plasmids in E. coli strains with the YFP reporter gene under the control of the PsulA promoter in the background of recA+ (MP060) and recA- (MP064). As a control, the plasmid, pIM-RM, with a kanamycin resistance cassette inserted in cat gene upstream of the PR promoter for REase gene (pIM-RMkan) was used, as well as strains without plasmids. (C) Plasmids pIM-RM and pACYCeco (both restriction proficient R+M+; high and low REase producers) were challenged using a 3-day growth competition assay to generate the co-cultures with the MG1655 strain without a plasmid (no RM system). As a control, plasmid with a restriction-negative variant was also used (pIM27: R-M+). Briefly, strains without plasmid were mixed 1:1 with cells carrying plasmid with the R–M system variant and allowed to grow in the co-cultures for 60 generations. Chloramphenicol resistance was used as a selection marker for CFUs of cells carrying the R–M system variants. The cell viability was measured at Generations 1 and 60, and calculated as the ratio of the CFUs on LB agar supplemented with chloramphenicol to the CFUs obtained on LB agar.The SOS response induction and R–M system instability in cells carrying the plasmid with the high R–M genes expression.

The higher the R–M system expression, the less efficient phage DNA restrictionTo determine whether the high levels of ecoRIRM expression resulted in more effective methylation of invading DNA, we supplied cells carrying pACYCeco or pIM-RM with an arabinose inducible MTase (pBAD-ecoM). Upon induction of the MTase, we observed a significant reduction of restriction in pACYCeco-carrying cells (Fig. 6A) and a loss of the permanent SOS-induction in pIM-RM carrying cells (Fig. 6B and C). We confirmed that the high ecoRIRM expression level was primarily linked with an overmethylation of foreign DNA and with the loss of the phage restriction phenotype. The results from these experiments with the EcoRI R–M system helped to explain the observation that higher R–M gene expression correlated with lower relative restriction of phage DNA and vice versa. It appears then that bacteriophage resistance may only be potent when methylation and restriction are balanced and their gene expression is sustained at very low levels. Overmethylation alleviates the highly restrictive phenotype and suppresses the autorestriction defects. Escherichia coli ER1992 (A) or MP060 cells (B, C) carrying pACYCeco or pIM-RM plasmids were co-transformed with pBADecoM carrying the arabinose inducible ecoRIM gene. MTase expression was induced with 0.04% for 1 h at 37 °C (A) or overnight (B, C). Then, a quantitative assay for restriction <U+03BB>vir phage DNA was performed (A), and SOS-inducing YFP fluorescence was measured (B) or microscopy of cells was conducted (C).Overmethylation alleviates the highly restrictive phenotype and suppresses the autorestriction defects.

The Xer/cer recombination system embedded in the PR promoter region was dispensable for R–M system expressionThe genetic elements comprising the Xer/cer recombination system overlapped the PR promoter region (Fig. 2), so it is reasonable to assume that this region might contribute to the repression of the ecoRIRM operon. Previous reports have demonstrated that the synaptic complex formed during plasmid dimer resolution can block RNA polymerase from accessing the PR promoter, and that the PR region may be occupied by XerCD recombinases and the FIS protein during Pcer repression in plasmid monomers.54 To test whether binding sites for Xer/cer proteins were embedded in the EcoRI main promoter, PR (Fig. 2), impact expression, we used our phage restriction assay in bacterial strains with defective XerC, XerD, ArgR, and PepA.63 The results showed no significant change in the DNA restriction properties for cells containing pACYCeco (Supplementary Fig. S3). We also removed the Pcer promoter along with Xer/cer-binding sites for recombination and accessory proteins (plasmids: pACYCcer, pACYCxerCD, and pACYCpR) (Supplementary Table 1). We observed only a slight increase in REase production that still allowed for a high level of antiviral functioning (Fig. 7; Supplementary Table S3).

(B) Relative restriction of the above constructs expressed as the efficiency of plating.To further characterize the minimum promoter required by the EcoRI R–M operon to maintain high levels of phage restriction, we constructed several pACYCeco derivatives, where the PR promoter was shortened36 or certain elements were replaced (Fig. 7). We did not see an increase in DNA restriction levels even, when the -35 box of the main PR promoter was substituted with a consensus promoter sequence (TTAAGG<U+2192>TTGACA; pACYCp*) (Fig. 7). There was a significant loss in restriction activity with a single nucleotide change (TTAAGG<U+2192>ATAAGG; pACYC-35T) to the -35 hexamer of PR (Fig. 7). This might have suggested that PR could not function as a simple -10 extended promoter,64,65 despite the structural potential (TGTTAATTC).36 In another construct, we inserted the EcoRI wild-type (WT) core promoter elements (-35 and -10 sequences) into the weak promoter of the tetracycline resistance gene (PtetA). The construct maintained the WT leader sequence for the transcript (pACYCtet) (Figs. 2 and 7; Supplementary Table S3). Cells with this plasmid showed a dramatic loss in phage restriction (Supplementary Table S3). The untranslated upstream element for the promoter from bla is recognized as important in expression and is in some cases indispensable to maintaining the fine-tuning in gene expression.66,67 Leaving the WT PR promoter intact, we then replaced the region downstream of -10 hexamer with one similar to that from the bla gene promoter to create pACYCblaRBS (Fig. 2). The construct used part of the native RBS from bla, and cells bearing it exhibited low levels (comparable to pACYCtet) of <U+03BB> DNA restriction in the phage assay (Fig. 7). Overall, these results indicated a very high degree of optimization for each element present in the WT EcoRI R–M promoter region.4. DiscussionIn general, studies focused on dissecting the detailed mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression tend to dedicate more attention to operon coding sequences rather than the transcriptional signals coming from the sequences outside the protein-coding regions. In the present report, we used the EcoRI R–M system as a model to focus on how operon adjacent sequences affected the balance between the REase and MTase levels in Type II R–M systems.4.1. Sequences flanking the ecoRIRM operon affect the expression of the REase and MTase levelsWe tested the possibility that the ratio of restriction and modification activities must operate within a narrow window of variation in order to balance protection from invading DNA and unwanted cell death from autorestriction, in a similar manner to the activity of a toxin/antitoxin systems.9 The results from our plasmid-based regulatory studies suggested that the activity and function of an R–M system as well as its impact on cellular fitness were linked to the genotype of the host bacterium. Our finding that the cellular levels and ratios between the REase and MTase could be different in different genetic contexts was in agreement with the results from other studies of the EcoRI operon.10ColE1-like plasmids are small, high copy and mobilizable replicons, which are perceived as the main vectors for the acquisition, evolution, and dissemination of a wide variety of genes including the R–M determinants.68–70 Our database survey revealed the existence of several homologs of the EcoRI R–M system located on ColE1-like plasmids from the Enterobacteriaceae family (E. coli, GenBank: ANUR01000054.1, CYBB01000052.1, J01675.1, NZ_CCRA01000002.1, and NZ_LDDU01000010.1; Shigella sonnei, GenBank: M97479; and Citrobacter youngae, GenBank: ABWL02000046.1). Notably, in all these cases, the sequences within the promoters and the upstream regions were almost identical. The location of the crossover site between the two Xer-binding sites in the cer region, which affects the 3' portion of the -35 sequence,43 may indicate that this promoter region is recruited randomly after each recombination event when a hybrid DNA sequence is formed from two different widespread cer-like sites.41,71 The XerC/D-mediated generation of co-integrates between different plasmids increased the possibilities of their rearrangements and further horizontal dissemination among Gram-negative rods.70,72 A good example of this possibility was the P6 plasmid carrying ecoRIRM genes in S. sonnei (GenBank M9479). The loss of a single T in the sequence considered to be the -35 box of PR (TTAAGG<U+2192>ATAAGG)36 may be the result of recombinational crossover at this locus.40,42,43 Other experiments have already shown that cer hybrids may lose all conserved and essential nucleotides at the -35 box consensus positions.43 Given these insights, we think that one important factor for efficient control of ecoRIRM expression is the -10 box of the promoter because it can act as a classical extended -10 promoter.36,64,65 For the constructs and conditions tested, we showed that the extended -10 box could not compensate in the cases of a poor or absent -35 sequence (Fig. 7). These fluctuations in the R–M system promoter strength may be crucial to the predator/prey roles in the restriction/host relationship and to the adaptive impacts on horizontal gene transfer at the stage of gene establishment and maintenance of a new host.4.2. A high expression level of R–M results in loss of cell viabilityR–M system expression imbalance can result in a loss of viability and cell death or may even give rise to restriction-deficient phenotypes in some hosts.14,29,30,73–79 Examples of these phenomena include the accumulation of single-strand breaks at non-cognate sites observed when EcoRV REase is overproduced,11 and the autorestriction-based reduction in cell fitness that occurs after the induction of R–M expression leading to prominent rearrangements that inactivate the mboIIR REase gene by IS elements.80 Furthermore, long-term mixed culture experiments suggest strong selective pressure against the presence of a DNA cutting agent that affects cell fitness.81 To the best of our knowledge, most experiments related to the contribution of R–M systems to plasmid stability were performed in a single host strain making it difficult to directly estimate the impact of the post-segregational host killing phenomenon in a broader context,82,83 e.g. as an important factor, which could play a role in the competition between populations of strains with different restriction phenotypes. In addition, the growth conditions may significantly affect the CoE1 plasmid copy, so it should also be considered as a dosage-dependent gene regulation factor,84,85 as well as the presence of the growth spatial structure (as in solid medium), which may favor the cells with a suicide strategy.86,87Death of cells triggered by the degradation of their own DNA after R–M gene complex loss is linked to an enhanced decrease in methylated sites and exposure to cognate REase action.31,33 We used SOS response-reporter strains as a direct approach to understanding the impacts of optimal and sub-optimal levels in R–M enzyme activities. Cells carrying a plasmid with higher R–M enzyme production (pIM-RM) exhibited cell filamentation and a typical SOS response phenotype (Fig. 5A and B). It was reported that accidental DNA autorestriction events occur even in the balanced EcoRI R–M system.88 It was also reported that atypical cells with unusually high accumulations of Esp1396I R–M enzymes undergo filamentation and lysis.12 Therefore, it is not surprising that we could observe substantial filamentation with an overexpressed R–M system, where the cognate protection was insufficient. A high REase to DNA target site ratio can generate the undesirable cuts at non-protected and/or non-specific sites (star sites),78,89 which is a typical feature for REases conferring promiscuity toward the target site, such as the extensively studied EcoRI REase.90,91 Because the pIM-RM bearing strain was suppressed from autorestriction by the overmethylation of EcoRI MTase (Fig. 6B and C), the cleavage specificity of the EcoRI REase was unaltered at higher levels. In parallel, the restriction ability displayed by the pACYCeco-carrying strain decreased dramatically under the same conditions (Fig. 6A). We also used growth competition assays under non-selective conditions in recombination-proficient strains as an indirect measure of the effects of R–M system regulation. In long-term co-cultures, the isogenic strain without R–M system genes was competing against an R–M proficient strain (high or low producer). The higher R–M producer (pIM-RM) failed to compete with the restriction deficient strain (Fig. 5C). Notably, the pIM-RM culture colonies that formed on agar plates were different in size, and the smallest was composed of mostly filamentous cells. In contrast, the lower R–M producer (pACYCeco) was not outcompeted by the restriction-deficient strain. The observed fitness defect of cells carrying the high level R–M enzyme producer may reflect the need for longer-term adaptation of the R–M system in order to match the genetic background and the molecular interrelationship network of the new host.92 It may also support the observation that chromosomal R–M systems are better adapted to fulfill their biological function. Indeed, the majority of all discovered R–M systems are chromosomal and rarely present on low-copy replicons.93,94 However, it has recently been shown that the strength of post-segregational host killing is not simply a function of the number of recognition sites present on the chromosome but also a reflection of the properties of a particular R–M system, including protein stability.17,88,95,965. ConclusionWe think that the balance in restriction and modification activities from a single-copy R–M system is operating very close to the edge of imbalance, and this has profound biological implications considering the role of the REase in efficiently degrading foreign DNA before the methylation arm of the system renders the DNA resistant. Alterations in gene copy number or promoter strength that affect R–M gene expression and enzyme concentration may be triggered by specific nutritional and/or growth conditions, as well as by the impact of the new genetic context resulting from rearrangement of R–M genes into a new host. Regulation of gene expression for chromosomal R–M systems appears to be mostly free of these external (environmental) factors.We thank Prof. Ichizo Kobayashi (University of Tokyo) for the gift of the antibodies against R and M of EcoRI RM system.

IntroductionTransposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA fragments that make up the largest fraction of eukaryotic genomes. For a long time, TEs were called ‘junk genes’ because they were thought to have no known function. In the past 30 years, research has shown that TEs play important roles in altering gene expression and structure,1–3 chromosome rearrangement,4,5 and the variability of genome size.6,7 Through these and other functions, TE transposition serves as an important source of genetic variation, and thus, TEs have been exploited for the genetic improvement in crops.Based on their different replication strategies, TEs in eukaryotes are divided into two broad classes: Type I elements (retrotransposons), which use an RNA-mediated mechanism for amplification, and Type II elements (DNA transposons), which use a DNA-mediated mechanism for transposition.8 Retrotransposons can amplify themselves into thousands or tens of thousands of copies, whereas DNA transposons rarely attain these levels, with the exception of miniature inverted-repeat TEs (MITEs).9 Each class of TEs contains autonomous elements, which have ORFs encoding the enzymes required for transposition, and non-autonomous elements, which do not encode transposition proteins but are still able to transpose.10 Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) are non-autonomous retrotransposons and depend on transposition proteins derived from their autonomous partners, long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), for amplification.11SINEs range in length from 80 to 500 bp. They are a heterogeneous group of elements derived from a variety of RNA genes (tRNA, 7SL RNA, and 5S RNA),10,12 but most are derived from tRNA gene sequences.13 SINEs are characterized by a simple sequence repeat, usually a poly(A) at the 3' terminus, and an internal RNA Pol III promoter within the 5' terminus.14 SINEs, except SINE3 from zebrafish, are flanked by target site duplications (TSDs).12 These features are weakly conserved in plants, and thus, the annotation of SINEs is difficult and tedious via computer-based methods that are widely used for genome-wide identification of TEs.15 Recently, Wenke et al. developed an algorithm for the de novo identification of SINEs, named ‘SINE-Finder’.14 However, at present, there remains fewer comprehensive studies of SINEs in plants than there are for other classes of TEs.Although SINEs are short in length and compose small portions of eukaryotic genomes, they are abundant. In the human genome, there are over 1 million copies of the SINE Alu, which accounts for ~11% of the genome.16 On the other hand, SINEs are relatively rare in plants. In potato, there are 2,359 SINE copies comprising 0.15% of the genome, and in sugar beets there are 6,326 SINE copies constituting 0.18% of the genome.14,17Once integrated, SINEs are able to provide regulatory sequences to adjacent genes at a new integration site and thereafter have the potential to influence gene regulation. In mammals, SINEs are located throughout the genome, from intergenic regions to protein-coding genes,18 and there is evidence that SINEs regulate gene expression. The mouse SINE B1 contains functional TF-binding sites for the carcinogen-activated dioxin receptor Xenobiotic Responsive Element (XRE) and for the epithelial–mesenchymal transition regulator Slug,19 indicating that B1 acts as a cis-regulatory element on neighbouring genes. Human Alu RNA blocks the transcription of some protein-coding genes by binding Pol II and entering complexes of promoters during heat shock,20 demonstrating its trans-regulation on distal genes. SINEs also play roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation. In human and mouse myoblasts, SINEs accumulate in 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) and regulate gene expression by Staufen-mediated mRNA decay.21 In plants, SINEs are frequently associated with genes. Approximately 38% of the insertions are associated with transcribed regions in wheat, and 30% of SINE copies are associated with genes in Solanaceae,15,22 indicating that SINEs also have the potential to regulate gene expression and alter gene structure in plants.There are some reports that TEs are involved in the development of mutations in fruit. A MITE-like insertion in the promoter region of CitRWP generates polyembryonic citrus varieties with polyembryonic alleles.23 In Chinese box orange, a MITE insertion with a variable level of DNA methylation in the promotor of AbRuby2 affects the accumulation of anthocyanins in leaves.24 In apple, a columnar mutation is associated with an integration of a Gypsy-like retrotransposon.25 Over the years, the selection of different bud sports (somatic mutation) has given rise to many new fruit cultivars, particularly in seedless fruits such as sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) and Clementine mandarin (Citrus reticulata). SINEs, which are frequently associated with genes, have the potential to cause somatic mutation. However, the roles of SINEs in plant somatic mutation are rarely reported because SINEs are poorly investigated in plants, especially in citrus.In this study, we identified 12 SINE families in 7 citrus genomes and analysed their family characteristics, amplification patterns, and copy distribution. We showed that citrus SINEs are inserted preferentially into AT-rich areas and enriched in the promoter regions of genes. In addition, citrus SINEs can create novel genes and be co-opted into genes. These results indicated that SINEs have played important roles in the gene and genome evolution of citrus.2. Materials and methods2.1. Data resourcesGenome sequences and annotation files of sweet orange (C. sinensis cv. Valencia, 319 Mbp), Mangshan wild mandarin (C. reticulata, 334 Mbp), haploid pummelo (Citrus grandis, 346 Mbp), Ichang papeda (Citrus ichangensis, 357 Mbp), and citron (Citrus medica, 405 Mbp) were downloaded via the ‘Citrus sinensis annotation project’ homepage (http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/orange/download/data.php).23,26 Genome sequences and annotation files of Clementine mandarin (C. reticulata cv. Clementina de Nules, 301 Mbp) were downloaded via the Citrus Genome Database homepage (https://www.citrusgenomedb.org/species/clementina/genome1.0) (Wu et al., 2014). Genome sequences and annotation files of Satsuma mandarin (C. reticulata cv. Miyagawa wase, 360 Mbp) were downloaded via the resources for citrus genomics homepage (http://www.citrusgenome.jp/).27 The expression data of sweet orange were queried from the ‘Citrus sinensis annotation project’ database homepage (http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn).282.2. Extraction of SINEsTo identify SINE candidates in citrus, we used the SINE-Finder program to search genome sequences using the default setting.14 In brief, the settings were as follows: a 5' TSD region of 40 nt, the box A motif RVTGG, a spacer of 25–50 nt, the box B motif GTTCRA, a spacer of 20–500 nt, six adenines or thymines as a poly(A/T) stretch or simple sequence repeats, and a 3' TSD region of 40 nt.The candidate sequences were clustered based on similarity using NCBI-BLAST 2.2.31+ toolkits.29 The procedure consisted of three steps: clustering of candidate sequences, verification of SINE copies, and family assignment.SINE candidates were clustered via all-against-all BLAST searches. In brief, an all-against-all BLAST was performed using the mega-BLAST algorithm with the following settings: qcov_hsp_perc of 80, perc_identity of 80, reward of 2, penalty of -3, gapopen of 5, gapextend of 2, word_size of 11, evalue of 10, no dust, and no soft_masking. The sequence with maximum homologues was retained while its homologues were removed. These two steps were repeated until no sequences had homologues. The remaining sequences were treated as representative copies.Representative copies were used as queries for mega-BLAST to search citrus genome sequences to verify the candidate sequences. Mega-BLAST settings were the same as those in the first step. Hit sequences plus 60 bp flanking sequences were extracted and aligned using MUSCLE.30 Alignments of each cluster were manually checked, and clusters without characteristics of SINEs or transposition hallmarks31 (where regions belonging to SINEs are highly similar, but flanking regions are usually unrelated sequences) were discarded.The remaining clusters were assigned into families via the construction of consensus sequences to perform all-against-all BLAST searches using the BLASTn algorithm with default settings, except that qcov_hsp_perc was 80, perc_identity was 80, and evalue was 10. Consensus sequences were constructed using SeaView.32 SINE clusters with significant similarity (qcov_hsp_perc of 80, perc_identity of 80, and evalue of 10) were combined into a SINE family. Each family was designated as a CitruS (Citrus SINE) with a different number. For verification of the family assignment, 20 full-length copies of the top hits for each family were aligned using MUSCLE29 prior to manual refinement and curation. Dendrograms were constructed with MEGA 7,33 applying the neighbour-joining distance method.The full-length copies of each family were retrieved by using consensus sequences as queries to search genome sequences with the BLASTn algorithm following default settings, except qcov_hsp_perc 80, perc_identity 80, and evalue 10. Retrieved sequences were aligned and checked to filter-out truncated SINE copies (the ends of homologous sequences varied by >5 bp). RepeatMasker34 searches against genome sequences were conducted using consensus sequences as queries to retrieve all copies of each family (including intact and truncated SINE copies) with the following settings: -nolow, -no_is, -par 28, -xsmall, and -gff. Overlapping SINE copies were fused to keep the outermost genomic coordinates using BEDTools35 under the following conditions: (i) overlapping SINE copies from an identical family were named after the original family and (ii) overlapping SINE copies from different families were named CitruS-composite.2.3. Identification of TSDs and insertion site preferencesFor identification of the TSDs of SINEs, a BLASTn search was performed using each full-length SINE sequence as a query with the default settings, except that word_size = 9, strand: plus, and evalue = 0.1. The results were filtered by size (10–40 nt) and location (upstream and downstream of SINEs).Five nucleotides of the flanking region upstream of the 5' TSD (positions -5 to -1) and the first six nucleotides of the 5' TSD (positions 0–5) of each full-length copy were extracted and aligned to investigate the insertion preferences of the SINEs. Sequence conservation at each position was graphically represented by Weblogo 3.362.4. Analysis of similarity profiles of SINE familiesSimilarity profiles of SINE families were calculated with a modified protocol as described by Schwichtenberg et al.,17 which was based on the sequence identity to the consensus sequence in each SINE family. In brief, a BLAST search was performed using consensus sequences as queries against all full-length copies, and then histograms were created using R script (https://www.R-project.org/) based on the resulting sequence identity data.2.5. Identification of SINE transpositionTo identify polymorphic SINE transposition sites in citrus, the leaves of 14 citrus cultivars were harvested from the collection at Huazhong Agriculture University (Wuhan, China). The DNA samples were isolated using Tiangen DP360 DNA extraction kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China).To experimentally validate the insertion polymorphism, 84 SINE copies from the CitruS-I and II families were randomly selected from the genome sequence of sweet orange to design three primers (one primer shared across two pairs) for each locus, with one set designed to amplify the complete SINE copy and the other for the 5' terminus of the SINE copy (Supplementary Table S1). Resulting polymorphic loci were mapped to the reference sequences of citrus using MUSCLE.29Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted in a MJ-PTC-200 thermal PCR cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA) using the following program: 5 min of 94°C, 32 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 60 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The reaction mixture (20 µL) contained about 20 ng of template genomic DNA, 0.2 µM each primer, 200 µM dNTPs, 1x PCR reaction buffer, and 1 unit of TaKaRa Taq™ DNA polymerase (Takara Bio, Beijing, China).2.6. Chromosomal localization and gene associationWe used MAPCHART37 to display the chromosomal localization of the citrus SINEs. The positional information (GFF) of each SINE was extracted from RepeatMasker outputs and converted to the format required by MAPCHART. The sequence lengths of the chromosomal pseudomolecules of sweet orange, pummelo, Satsuma mandarin, and the longest nine scaffolds of Clementine mandarin were calculated to define the expected length of chromosomes for MAPCHART.To analyse the association of the citrus SINEs with annotated genes, we compared the sites of SINE integration to the genomic coordinates of genes using BEDTools and the R packages systemPipeR and GenomicFeatures.38,39 The SINE family specific fraction of genes as well as the distances of intergenic copies to the closest neighbouring gene were determined as described.15 Genic regions were further distinguished into cds, introns, and UTRs according to the GFF annotation files. Intergenic regions were further distinguished into regions =1 kb upstream of genes, 1–2 kb upstream of genes, 2–5 kb upstream of genes, and =5 kb upstream of genes. When the downstream region of a gene overlapped with the upstream region of the next gene (0–5 kb), the overlapping region was excluded from the upstream region of the next gene (0–5 kb). The number of SINEs within each region was counted. Exemplary loci harbouring SINEs were manually refined and visualized with the respective annotations using Adobe illustrator CS6 (www.adobe.com). A dot plot of the dispersed duplication derived from truncated SINEs was calculated using the Emboss tool ‘Dotmatcher’ with the following settings: wordsize 20 and threshold 50.40The Chi-squared test was used to compare the expected and observed values for gene association. The theoretical expectation was calculated based on the portion (%) of features in the genome, which was determined based on the published gene annotations after fusing overlapping annotations.2.7. Comparative analysis of homologous SINE-containing lociSINE copies sharing both 5' and 3' flanking sequences were isolated from the alignment of each family to extract syntenic blocks. Then, 200 bp sequences flanking both ends of these SINE copies were extracted and aligned. SINE copies sharing identical flanking sequences (identity =80%) were referred to as homologous SINE-containing loci (HSCLs). Synteny for HSCLs was illustrated by Circos41 following the instructions provided by the author.3. Results3.1. Mining SINEs in citrus genomesUsing SINE-Finder and the public genome sequences of Clementine mandarin, Mangshan wild mandarin, Satsuma mandarin, pummelo, sweet orange, citron, and Ichang papeda, 10,632 SINE candidates were identified. To exclude false candidates, we developed a three-step pipeline to refine the output from SINE-Finder. In the first step, all-against-all BLAST searches using the mega-BLAST algorithm was performed to cluster the SINE candidates and find representative copies. Secondly, the representative copies were used as queries for BLAST searches to retrieve homologous sequences and flanking sequences from genome sequences. The resulting sequences were aligned, and 15 clusters were identified as SINEs, each of them harboured typical structural SINE features, such as RNA polymerase III promoter boxes A and B, poly(A/T) tails, TSDs, and transposition hallmarks.31 Clusters lacking any one of these features were removed. Thirdly, another all-against-all BLAST search was performed between the consensus sequences of 15 clusters using the BLASTn algorithm to find similarities between the clusters. The BLAST results revealed that these SINEs were grouped into 12 distinct families, designated CitruS-I to CitruS-XII (Table 1 and Supplementary Data S1), following Wicker’s ‘80-80-80’ criteria.8SINE families in seven citrus genomesnt: nucleotides; Clementine: Clementine mandarin; Mangshan: Mangshan wild mandarin; Satsuma: Satsuma mandarin.Including full-length copies and truncated copies.Consensus sequence without poly(A/T).Averaged length.CitruS-composite.Genome fractions covered by SINEs.SINE families in seven citrus genomesnt: nucleotides; Clementine: Clementine mandarin; Mangshan: Mangshan wild mandarin; Satsuma: Satsuma mandarin.Including full-length copies and truncated copies.Consensus sequence without poly(A/T).Averaged length.CitruS-composite.Genome fractions covered by SINEs.Consensus sequences of the 12 families were used as queries for BLAST searches against the 7 citrus genomes, resulting in 11,275 full-length copies (Table 1). Pummelo harboured the highest copy number, with 2,118 full-length copies, and citron harboured the lowest copy number, with 1,339 full-length copies. The lengths of the consensus sequences were highly variable, ranging from 192 nt (CitruS-XI) to 335 nt (CitruS-IV). RepeatMasker was utilized to find all of the members, including full-length copies and truncated copies that resulted from genomic rearrangements and/or termination of the RNA intermediate. A total of 41,573 full-length and truncated SINE copies were found among all seven citrus genomes (Table 1 and Supplementary Data S2), in which the number of SINE in each species ranged from 7,097 (citron) to 4,792 (Clementine mandarin). Hundreds of composite SINEs were identified that represented overlapping copies of SINEs from different families. The genome fractions covered by SINEs varied between 0.37%, in pummelo, and 0.33%, in mandarins (Clementine mandarin, Mangshan wild mandarin, and Satsuma mandarin).The number of full-length SINEs differed widely among the families (Table 1). CitruS-I was the most populous family, with >3,434 full-length copies across the seven citrus genomes, whereas the CitruS-III and CitruS-X families each contained <100 full-length copies. The remaining nine families had >340 full-length members. The abundance of the full-length SINEs differed from the number of all members (truncated and full-length) of each family identified using RepeatMasker.34 Some families had relatively few full-length copies but abundant truncated members. To shed light on this inconsistency, we calculated the copy number ratios of full-length copies to all members for each family (Fig. 1), referred to as the full-length rate. The average full-length rate of all citrus SINEs was ~0.27, which indicated that most copies of citrus SINEs were truncated during evolution. The average full-length rate varied among the SINE families, ranging from 0.02 in CitruS-X to 0.62 in CitruS-I. The differences in the full-length rate among the SINE families were substantially broader in different genomes, ranging from 0.01 (CitruS-X in citron) to 0.86 (CitruS-III in Ichang papeda). These data suggested that citrus SINEs experienced family specific evolutionary histories. The full-length rate of citrus SINEs characterized on the SINE family and genome level. Full-length rates for each family are presented for Clementine mandarin, Satsuma mandarin, Mangshan wild mandarin, pummelo, sweet orange, citron, Ichang papeda, and the average across all seven genomes (average).

The dashed line represents the average full-length rate of all citrus SINEs.3.2. Comparative analysis of citrus SINEsTo verify the structural features of citrus SINEs, each full-length SINE copy plus 60 nts of flanking sequences was extracted and compared. SINE copies within each family were highly conserved and shared sequence similarity of 80–100%, but their flanking regions were not similar, confirming the presence of transposition hallmarks.31 Two conserved motifs (box A and box B) were identified in all 12 SINE families (Supplementary Fig. S1).TSDs originate from the integration process of SINEs and thereafter retain residual information of the transposition process. Among the 11,275 full-length SINEs, we identified 4,793 with pair-matched TSDs (size threshold: 10–40 nt) (Supplementary Data S3). The TSDs averaged between 15 and 17 nt (Table 1). The length of individual TSDs was variable, with the majority of copies ranging from 10 to 22 nt (Supplementary Fig. S2). To illustrate the insertion preferences of the citrus SINEs, the families that had at least 30 full-length copies with detectable TSDs were further investigated. We examined five nucleotides of the flanking region upstream of the 5' TSD (positions -5 to -1) and the first six nucleotides of the 5' TSD (positions 0–5) of each SINE copy (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S3). Generally, citrus SINEs preferentially integrated upstream of short adenine stretches (positions 0–5), with the first two nucleotides of the TSD (positions 0–1) most likely being adenine. The flanking region upstream of the TSD (positions -4 to -2) was A/T rich. However, the first nucleotide upstream of the TSD (position -1) was rarely adenine. The 5' termini of TSDs were rich in adenines, which likely overlapped with the poly(A) tails. The variations in the lengths of poly(A) tails were not evaluated to avoid bias derived from overlap between poly(A) tails and TSDs.

The insertion site preferences of the remaining seven SINE families are shown in Supplementary Fig. S3.To visualize the divergence and grouping of the SINE families, we attempted to construct a dendrogram using the 20 full-length SINE sequences from each family with the highest similarity to the consensus sequence. A trial construction of the dendrogram failed due to the presence of three excessively divergent families. However, a dendrogram was constructed when the remaining nine families that formed separate branches were used. The families CitruS-II and CitruS-VI were assigned to two subfamilies and grouped on separate branches (Fig. 2B). The consensus sequences of CitruS-II a/b and CitruS-VI a/b showed identity values of 82.2 and 82.1%, respectively. In contrast, the consensus sequences of CitruS-VII and IV show identities of 70%, due to which they are classified as distinct SINE families rather than subfamilies.3.3. Estimation of the age and transposition activity of the SINEsThe lengths of TSDs and poly(A) tails are indicators of the relative insertion time of individual SINE copies.15,17,42,43 In citrus, the lengths of the TSDs and poly(A) tails were not eligible as an age indicator because more than half of the full-length copies did not have detectable TSDs, and the poly(A) tails were likely to overlap with short adenine stretches of the TSDs. Therefore, these could not be utilized to determine the age of the SINE copies in citrus. Generally, SINE copies were ‘copied and pasted’ a long time ago, leading to the accumulation of mutations. As the consensus sequence is a suitable approximation of the original source copy, the decreasing identity of a copy to the consensus sequence can serve as an alternative way to estimate its age.15,44,45To estimate the activity of a SINE family, we calculated copy numbers relative to sequence similarity intervals for the families/subfamilies that had at least 30 full-length copies (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S4). Figure 3 shows typical examples of SINEs with family- and genome-specific transposition patterns. In some families, for example CitruS-I in sweet orange, each similarity interval contained a relatively consistent copy number, suggesting that this family had consistent activity over a long period (Fig. 3A). In pummelo, all CitruS-I copies were at least 90% similar to the consensus sequence, indicating a recent activity of this family in pummelo (Fig. 3B). Some families, for example CitruS-XI in Satsuma mandarin, were predicted to be old, because all SINE copies had similarities of <91% to the consensus sequence (Fig. 3C). Peaks of ~90% similarity were identified in some families, for example CitruS-VII in sweet orange, which suggested that there was an ancient rapid amplification of these families (Fig. 3D). Comparison of copy numbers and sequence similarities among citrus SINE families. For three SINE families, histograms were created based on the identity of each full-length SINE copy within the family to the consensus sequence. Different example patterns are shown, namely, (A) a consistent activity over a long period, (B) a recent activity, (C) transposition activity a long time ago, and (D) an aged, rapid amplification. The complete data for the remaining 74 SINE families by genome are shown in Supplementary Fig. S4.Comparison of copy numbers and sequence similarities among citrus SINE families. For three SINE families, histograms were created based on the identity of each full-length SINE copy within the family to the consensus sequence. Different example patterns are shown, namely, (A) a consistent activity over a long period, (B) a recent activity, (C) transposition activity a long time ago, and (D) an aged, rapid amplification. The complete data for the remaining 74 SINE families by genome are shown in Supplementary Fig. S4.CitruS-I and CitruS-II were used to search for polymorphic SINE copies in citrus to verify different amplifications. For each locus, three primers were designed to form two primer pairs in order to amplify two overlapping products, the complete SINE copy and the 5' terminus of the SINE copy, with one primer upstream of the SINE copy, one primer downstream of the SINE copy and one primer inside the SINE copy. We detected a polymorphic SINE copy that was mainly derived from CitruS-IIa (CitruS-composite) in 14 citrus accessions (Fig. 4A and B). The SINE copy was absent in all 3 pummelo accessions but was present in the remaining 11 accessions, namely, 4 accessions of mandarin and 7 accessions of sweet orange. Moreover, two accessions of mandarin were homozygous for a SINE insertion, and the remaining nine accessions were heterozygous. There were no SINE insertions in a locus located in the sixth intron of a polygalacturonase gene in the published reference genome of Clementine mandarin (cv. Clementina de Nules) (Fig. 4C), but the PCR results showed that the locus was heterozygous for the SINE insertion (cv. Caffin). Genomic sequence variations derived from SINE insertion.

Gene association and chromosomal distribution of citrus SINEsTo shed light on the association of SINEs with genes, we analysed the frequency and position of citrus SINEs relative to annotated genes (Fig. 5A). On average, 7.9% of citrus SINEs were located in genes, of which the majority was found in introns and UTRs. Only 0.5% (0.1–1.4%) of citrus SINEs were found in coding regions of genes (cds). Based on the physical length of the annotated genes,26 an average of 29% (25–36.4%) of the citrus genome sequences were annotated as genes, which indicated a highly significant depletion of SINEs in genic regions compared with the expectation by random distribution according to Chi-squared tests (P < 0.001). Approximately 18.4% of citrus SINEs were found in close proximity (=1 kb upstream) to genes, which indicated a significant enrichment of SINEs in promoter regions (P < 0.001). Approximately 38.7% of citrus SINEs were 1–5 kb upstream of the next gene, and 34.9% were located more distantly (>5 kb). The fact that SINEs were enriched in promoter regions suggested that SINEs have the potential to influence the regulation of the expression of neighbouring genes.

The average distribution across all seven genomes is shown in ‘the average of citrus’. (B) Chromosomal mapping of all SINEs in pummelo, sweet orange, and Satsuma mandarin. Scale provided in Mbp.There were evident differences between the individual SINE families in the association with genes in all citrus genomes. The family CitruS-I accounted for at least 29.8% of SINEs located in cds in sweet orange, Satsuma mandarin, and Clementine mandarin, but no genic SINEs in the remaining four genomes (Supplementary Fig. S5). Overall, the CitruS-I and VIb families were the top two genic SINE fractions in citrus (16.5 and 12.5%, respectively).The localization of SINE copies was investigated on chromosomal pseudomolecules of Satsuma mandarin, sweet orange, and pummelo to determine the chromosomal distribution of citrus SINEs. The citrus SINEs had a dispersed distribution, with a preference for distal to subterminal regions on some chromosomes (Fig. 5B). Nevertheless, citrus SINEs had small regions of local depletion. The distributions of citrus SINEs also showed family specific differences. For example, the highly abundant CitruS-I and VIb mapped along chromosomes with different patterns in Satsuma mandarin, sweet orange, and pummelo (Supplementary Fig. S6).3.5. Contribution of SINEs to gene and genome evolutionAll cds containing SINEs in sweet orange were examined as an example to elucidate the role of citrus SINEs in gene and genome evolution. Comparison of the gene annotations indicated that SINEs might affect transcript structure as they contribute exons as well as splice sites and start and stop codons (Fig. 6). In Fig. 6A, a SINE copy was integrated into the sixth intron as a new exon and contributed two splice sites, maintaining the reading frame of the downstream region. The SINE transcript harboured the 3' splice site (AG) of the sixth intron and the 5' splice site (GU) of the seventh intron. In Fig. 6B, a SINE copy provided the first exon, a start codon, and a 5' splice site. Citrus SINEs donating stop codons (Fig. 6C and D) were also identified in genes.

Citrus SINEs were identified that (A) created a new exon and contributed two splice sites, (B and F) provided the first exon donating a start codon and (B) a 5' splice site, (C and D) donated stop codons, and (E, F) created novel genes.We identified 10 short genes containing only one exon (Supplementary Table S2), eight of them encoding unrecognized proteins, one encoding a WRKY DNA-binding protein (Cs8g16370), and one encoding a retrotransposon protein (orange1.1t01062.1). Further investigation revealed that these genes were derived from a SINE and its flanking sequences, in which the SINE provided the start/stop codons or part of the internal codons (Fig. 6E and F). Upon query of the publicly available RNA-seq dataset (citrus.hzau.edu.cn) derived from callus, leaf, flower, and fruit of sweet orange, we found that all 10 genes were expressed at low or moderate levels. The gene Cs5g04640 was significantly up-regulated (P < 0.01) in fruit compared with callus (Supplementary Table S3). These data suggested that these 10 genes were able to transcribe into RNA. In 5 kb of flanking regions, there were no sequences annotated as TEs surrounding the retrotransposon gene orange1.1t01062.1, which indicated the gene orange1.1t01062.1 was not likely a part of another TE. The gene Cs8g16370, encoding a homolog of a functional protein, was mainly derived from a SINE. Therefore, we inferred that orange1.1t01062.1 and Cs8g16370 might be co-opted from SINEs, and the remaining eight small genes were likely novel genes created by SINEs. In addition, we found tandem amplification and dispersed duplications derived from truncated SINEs (Supplementary Fig. S7), which suggested that SINEs participate in genomic rearrangements.3.6. Comparative analysis of HSCLAlignment of full-length SINE copies revealed hundreds of clusters of SINE copies that shared almost identical flanking sequences (Supplementary Fig. S8), indicating that these SINEs were located in homologous loci. Two hundred base pairs of flanking sequences at both ends of each copy in each cluster were extracted and aligned. Loci in which SINE copies shared identical flanking sequences (identity =80%) were designated HSCLs. HSCLs were divided into unique HSCLs and multiple HSCLs according to their number of occurrences in each genome. The number of occurrences of HSCLs was not consistent in all seven genomes due to family specific amplification of citrus SINEs after speciation. We identified 1,038 unique HSCLs shared by sweet orange, pummelo, and Clementine mandarin, of which 234 were shared by all three species, 331 were shared by sweet orange and pummelo, 375 were shared by sweet orange and Clementine mandarin, and 99 were shared by pummelo and Clementine mandarin. Given that sweet orange is a descendant of ancient pummelo and an ancestor of Clementine mandarin,26,46 those data may reflect the evolutionary relationship between these species.The chromosomal localization of the SINE copies in the unique HSCLs based on their physical positions was visualized on chromosomal pseudomolecules of sweet orange, pummelo, and the nine longest scaffolds (>10 Mbp) of Clementine mandarin (Supplementary Fig. S9A) to illustrate the synteny of unique HSCLs that amounted to orthologs. Although the majority of unique HSCLs retained substantial synteny, chromosomal rearrangements were observed when we compared the unique HSCL distribution at the chromosome level. For example, while sharing the majority of syntenic blocks with chromosome 4 of sweet orange, scaffold 1 of Clementine mandarin has some blocks homologous to chromosomes 7 and 1 of sweet orange (Fig. 7A). Similar patterns of synteny and chromosomal rearrangements were found among sweet orange, pummelo, and Satsuma mandarin (Supplementary Fig. S9B and Fig. 7B). These syntenic blocks derived from unique HSCLs might provide a robust and precise sequence framework for understanding citrus genome evolution and aid in the assembly of chromosomal pseudomolecules in citrus.

In current citrus genome annotations, SINEs are either underestimated or absent compared with our results.23,26,27,47 The difficulty in mining SINEs and their low proportions in the genomes may explain the incomplete annotation of SINEs in these released genomes. The absence of annotated SINEs will hinder the calling of genome structure variants, ultimately compromising all efforts based on next generation sequencing. In the present study, we identified 41,573 SINE copies in 12 families in seven citrus genomes. Some of these SINE copies were associated with genes, which indicate that the insertion of SINEs around genes may be an important source of variations in gene expression and structure.Our preliminary results are based on the results of using SINE-Finder.14 Approximately half of the candidates were either parts of other TEs (such as LTR retrotransposons) or not TEs, which diminishes the efficiency of mining for SINEs. In the present study, we developed a pipeline to filter and cluster the SINE candidates produced by SINE-Finder.14 The pipeline is based on NCBI-BLAST+ tools29 with the ‘qcov_hsp_perc’ and ‘perc_identity’ options, which enabled us to remove false candidates and follow Wicker’s ‘80-80-80’ rule8 for SINE family assignment.Wenke et al.14 proposed a new rule for SINE family assignment because they believed that the heterogeneity in the sequences and lengths of SINEs contradicted the criteria for the SINE family assignment suggested by Wicker et al.8 Thereafter, Schwichtenberg et al.17 assigned Amaranthaceae SINEs to the same family when they shared at least 60% similarity, resulting in 22 SINE families. This is why the full-length SINE copies in our study showed an average sequence similarity of 84–91% to the consensus, while the average sequence similarity ranged from 60 to 100% in Wenke et al.14 and Schwichtenberg et al.17The copy number of TEs is the result of the balance between amplification and partial or complete loss.47 Amplification and loss lead to lineage-specific TE copy numbers and copy number variation across families.10,15,48,49 In the present report, we found that the copy number of full-length SINEs varied significantly across SINE families and that the variations had family specific patterns in citrus. The full-length SINE copies represented recent amplifications or retentions of the intact sequences, while truncated SINEs may result from an incomplete reverse transcription during SINE transposition or partial removal of genomic SINE copies. The full-length rate of SINE families might be an indicator of the balance between SINE amplification and partial loss. Therefore, we inferred that many members of the CitruS-I and CitruS-III families might be newly formed or stably intact based on their full-length rates and activity estimates.Site-preferential insertion is observed in many classes of TEs.50–53 Our results showed that SINEs have a very strong preference to integrate upstream of short adenine stretches, which strongly resemble the cleavage site specificity of human LINE L1 endonuclease.54 SINEs are non-coding and require both active LINEs and sequence-dependent recognition of the SINE 3' end by the LINE reverse transcriptase for retrotransposition.14 Our results indicate that citrus SINEs might use reverse transcriptional machinery of LINE L1. The strong preference for AT-rich areas also indicates that citrus SINEs preferentially insert into areas with light cytosine methylation, compared with GC-rich areas. As inferred from previous reports,14,17 site-preferential insertion may be a reason for the enrichment of citrus SINEs near genes. While LTR retrotransposons, the most abundant TEs in plants, are enriched in heterochromatin and silenced by DNA methylation of cytosine nucleotides and histone methylation,55–58 SINEs are not enriched in telomeric and centromeric heterochromatin.59 In citrus, SINEs also have a dispersed distribution pattern along chromosomes. Site-preferential insertion might be one possible explanation for the distribution patterns of SINEs on chromosomes.The 12 citrus SINE families compose 0.35% of the citrus genome on average, which is much less than the content of SINEs in the human genome.16 These results also show that SINEs are not as abundant as other types of TEs in plants.47,60,61 However, >28% of the SINE copies were located in genic and adjacent areas (cds, introns, UTRs, and 1 kb upstream of gene) in the citrus genome, which is consistent with observations in Amaranthaceae and Solanaceae species.14,17 These observations suggest that SINEs are often associated with genes.Our results revealed that citrus SINEs promoted gene evolution by their insertion into promoter regions, by increasing UTR and intron lengths, by providing splice sites, exons, and start and stop codons, and by creating novel genes. These events are called TE co-options. TE co-options are involved in changing the patterns of gene expression, changing the functions of the proteins they encode, or both.62 We believe that in citrus, SINEs were co-opted into genes by providing new potential regulatory sequences to adjacent genes, altering gene structure, and creating novel genes. Interestingly, new SINE integrations may create novel genes.Our results showed that there was a highly significant depletion of SINEs in genic regions, which might be the result of the transposition of SINEs under selective constraints. This finding suggests that SINE insertions in genic regions might account for only a small fraction of alterations in gene structure. However, SINEs are enriched in promotor regions (=1 kb upstream of genes), indicating that SINEs might serve as regulatory sequences of neighbouring genes in citrus. TEs respond to biotic and abiotic stresses, including pathogens, extreme environmental conditions, polyploidization, and interspecies hybridization.15,63–65 DNA methylation of inserted TEs also affects gene expression.24 Therefore, we speculate that SINEs might play roles in regulating gene expression through insertion into the regulatory sequences and dynamic changes in DNA methylation.The insertion of a SINE creates a new allele at each specific locus, which can be inherited by descendants to form HSCLs. HSCLs were unique in each genome except those located inside duplicated genomic regions. The distribution and abundance of unique HSCLs can function as indictors of chromosomal rearrangements. There is a complicated phylogenetic relationship among citrus species. For example, sweet orange, the most widely cultivated citrus, is the offspring of previously admixed individuals derived from pummelo and mandarin, while Clementine mandarin (also known as Algerian tangerine) is a hybrid of Mediterranean mandarin (Willowleaf) and sweet orange.45 Comparative analysis of unique HSCLs revealed some chromosome rearrangements, suggesting that unique HSCLs are useful tools for ancestry research. Similar patterns of chromosome rearrangements were found between mandarins (Clementine and Satsuma) and sweet orange, which reflected the similar genetic background between Clementine mandarin and Satsuma mandarin. With the widespread use of next generation sequencing, we now have the chance to observe a different aspect of the forces that shape molecular evolution by studying gene sequence variation within a species.66 Unique HSCLs might be useful tools for comparison of intraspecies variation, too. Nevertheless, the use of unique HSCLs in evolution research has limitations, because the mining of syntenic HSCLs depends on high-quality genome assembly.The accuracy of our results relied on the quality of the de novo sequencing of the genome. Constant improvement in genome sequences due to ongoing assembly, anchoring and orientation of scaffolds and annotation will improve the identification and annotation of SINEs.17 Our results that SINEs play an important role in gene and genome evolution will serve as a foundation for future investigations of TEs in citrus.We would like to thank Anita K.

IntroductionThe term environmental RNA interference (RNAi) refers to a mechanism in which cells or species can take up regulatory RNA from the medium, food or the environment.1 Two surprising findings contribute to this phenomenon: RNA can be taken up into cells systemically distributed among multicellular organisms. Second, the foreign RNA can be processed into small RNA with regulatory power in gene regulation, thus environmental RNA is capable of interfering in gene expression.dsRNA uptake mechanisms have been intensively studied in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, where two RNA transporters have been identified. Sid-2 imports dsRNA from the gut-lumen into cells, and Sid-1 is necessary for systemic RNAi, i.e. to transport short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from cell to cell.2,3 Although the Sid-1 channel is widely distributed in many but not all eukaryotes, a systematic analysis of Sid-1 positive species for being capable of systemic RNAi is missing. One reason for that is probably Sid-deficient nematode species also shows systemic RNAi.4 As a result, there seem to be many undiscovered mechanisms for species to realize environmental RNAi.Nevertheless, this system seems to be quite attractive for biotechnology: dsRNA could be seen as a drug and easily delivered to cells and organisms to control, e.g. virus replication. In addition to the initial studies in C. elegans, many studies have investigated the oral administration of bacterial-, plant- or in vitro-transcribed dsRNA to shrimp,5,6 planarians,7 and insects8 making significant progress in the usage of dsRNA as a species-specific drug for pest control. However, little is known about off-target effects and a suitable risk assessment for artificial dsRNA in the environment, in genetic engineered plants or in animal farming.We therefore need to understand more about individual RNA uptake and individual siRNA accumulation pathways of different species. The issue becomes even more important as cells and species usually do not only show a single but also several RNAi mechanisms occurring in parallel. Often different small RNA species, e.g. siRNA, micro-RNA (miRNA), or piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) are involved. Moreover, these mechanisms are not independent, but share individual components. Dicer for instance, responsible for sRNA cleavage from dsRNA, has been shown to be involved in many different mechanisms, e.g. C. elegans Dcr-1.9 Cleavage of these dsRNA occurring in equal intervals is called phasing.10 Importantly there is not only an overlap between different siRNA mechanisms but also to the miRNAs. Feeding of exogenous dsRNA (exo-dsRNA), and subsequent siRNA accumulation, was shown to increase transcript levels of miRNAs targets, thus implicating a competition between environmental and endogenous RNAi on the siRNA and miRNA level.11We used Paramecium tetraurelia, a single-celled free-living genetic model to analyse the effect of dsRNA feeding on the endogenous siRNA (endo-siRNA) population and endogenous gene regulation. This organism is capable of RNAi by feeding dsRNA producing bacteria12 and the underlying mechanisms have been intensively studied. Two RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs) and DCR1 are necessary for primary siRNA production, but the genetic requirements for secondary siRNA products are less clear.13–15 A recent genome wide study identified 2,602 endo-siRNA producing loci. Of these, 1,618 endo-siRNA loci overlap with annotated genes in different transcriptomic states (serotypes) of Paramecium.16 This study also revealed that many endo-siRNA loci depend on the two RDRs (RDR1 and RDR2), which are involved in the feeding pathway, too. This may indicate that there could be a mechanistic overlap between endo- and exo-RNAi. Paramecium does not show any canonical miRNAs. In contrast to other organisms, Paramecium’s endo-siRNAs are not strictly associated with gene silencing, because many highly expressed genes show high abundance of siRNAs as well.16 These may be involved in trans silencing processes or they might be the result of unspecific accumulation such as spurious Dicer activity or inefficient siRNA degradation mechanisms.In this study, RNAi was applied to two different serotypes cultivated at different temperatures to analyse the phenomena in different backgrounds, because serotypes differ not only in the expression of the individual serotype gene but also large parts of their transcriptome.17 Moreover, some small RNA pathways in Paramecium also show a temperature dependency, as transgene induced silencing of the ND169 gene works most efficiently at high temperatures (31°C).18 Using RNAi by feeding, we introduced dsRNA against the major Dicer gene, DCR1, and a control gene, ND169. We investigated the effect of exo-dsRNA to the accumulation of the recently identified 1,618 endo-siRNAs overlapping with annotated genes, in different transcriptomic states (serotypes) in Paramecium. We aimed to dissect the genetic requirements of phased and non-phased endo-siRNAs as well as to analyse these for potential genome wide off-target effects by deep sequencing of siRNAs and mRNA.2. Materials and methods2.1. Cell culture and RNAiSerotype pure cultures of P. tetraurelia stock 51 were cultivated under standard conditions using Klebsiella planticola infused WGP (wheat grass powder) medium [wild-type (WT) cultures]. Serotype 51A cultures were kept at 31°C, 51B at 24°C, and checked for surface antigen expression by immobilization with polyclonal antibodies as described.17 RNAi by feeding was carried out as previously described using Escherichia coli.12,19 The feeding fragments used for dsRNA synthesis had the following genomic positions (kind gift of E. Meyer, Paris): scaffold51_70:312063-313251 for DCR1 (PTET.51.1.G0700179) and scaffold51_21:137857-138267 for ND169 (PTET.51.1.G0210080).2.2. RNA isolation and sequencingTotal RNA was isolated from vegetative cells (autogamy was checked by nuclei staining with DAPI) using Tri-Reagent (Sigma) as described20 before. After additional DNAse digestion and subsequent purification with acid phenol, sRNA fractions were enriched by denaturing gel electrophoresis and cutting the gel from 17 to 25 nts. After re-isolation of the sRNAs by extraction in 0.3 M NaCl, sRNAs were precipitated and we used the NEB Small RNA library preparation Kit (New England Biolabs) with elongated 3´-adapter ligation to limit biases against 2´-O-methylated siRNAs. Long RNA libraries were prepared after poly-A enrichment using the NEBNext Ultra directional RNA preparation Kit (New England Biolabs). Both setups were sequenced on a HiSeq2500 (Illumina), sRNAs in Rapid mode and long RNA in High Output mode. Reads were trimmed for adapters and low-quality bases by the cutadapt (version 1.4.121) wrapper trim galore (version 0.3.3; https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/, accessed 28 April 2020).2.3. Data descriptionWe utilized the sRNA-seq replicates of WT serotype 51A, and 51B, which we obtained from our recent study16 (Cluster definition data; ENA Accession: PRJEB25903). Further we performed sRNA-seq on RNAi knockdown samples (two replicates each for both 51A, and 51B serotypes). We obtained mRNA expression data for WT serotypes (51A, 51B) produced as part of our earlier study17 (ENA Accession: PRJEB9464). Additionally, we sequenced mRNA from RNAi knockdown samples (three replicates each for 51A, and 51B serotypes). All RNAi knockdown sequencing datasets produced for this study can be accessed at ENA (Accession: PRJEB33364).2.4. Quantification of small RNAWe pre-processed the sRNA datasets to represent only 21-25 nt sRNA reads in this study. We retrieved the locations of the 1,618 endo-siRNA loci, which overlap with annotated genes from the supplementary methods of Karunanithi et al.,16 and quantified them using the RAPID software.22 We utilized the default parameters of RAPID, which performs error-free alignments using bowtie2,23 while allowing multi-mapping reads.2.5. Normalization of small RNA dataWe performed the knockdown corrected scaling (KDCS) normalization method22 implemented in RAPID to normalize the sRNA read counts. In a nutshell, the KDCS method subtracts the reads aligning to the feeding associated regions from the estimated read library size before performing a total count scaling.Let us assume that we want to normalize the reads for an endo-siRNA locus with a read count of R. The total number of reads in the respective library mapping to the genome is T, with K number of feeding associated reads. We define the normalized read abundance of the endo-siRNA region, R', as R'=R×M/(T-K)<U+2060>, where M is the maximum of the values (T1-K1),..,(Tn-Kn) for n samples.All sRNA data normalization in this work is done using the KDCS method, except for Fig. 1E. As we want to show the abundance of the feeding associated reads in Fig. 1E, we correct for changes in total sequence depth (total count scaling) but do not correct for small RNA reads from the feeding region. Under the assumptions described earlier, we perform total count scaling as R'=R×M/T where M is the maximum of the values T1,..,Tn of all n samples.Strand-specific small RNA coverage (y-axis; log2) of the genes ND169 (A and B), DCR1 (C and D) in the respective serotype-knockdown library is shown. (E) A bar plot showing the normalized sRNA read counts (y-axis) of the knocked down RNAi genes in the respective serotype-knockdown samples (x-axis; library).

(F) Fold change of gene expression (TPM in knockdown vs. TPM of wild-type of mRNAs targeted by primary siRNAs in both serotypes).2.6. Quantification of mRNA expressionWe used Salmon24 (version 0.8.2) to quantify the mRNA expression in transcripts per million (TPM), with default parameters. All quantifications were done using the recent annotation25 of P. tetraurelia MAC genome (version 2; stock 51). Mean of replicates were used for all analyses, unless otherwise mentioned. While calculating the expression of the knockdown genes in Fig. 1F, we excluded the feeding-associated regions from the transcripts for the respective RNAi knockdown samples. To account for alignment artifacts, we added 100 bps both upstream and downstream, while excluding the feeding-associated regions.2.7. Clustering of expression dataWe created heatmaps of the endo-siRNA and mRNA expression data using the heatmap.2 function from the R/Bioconductor package gplots (version 3.0.1.1). We performed a hierarchical clustering of the libraries with complete linkage using an euclidean distance measure.2.8. Differential expression analysisUtilizing the WT libraries as control samples, we performed a differential expression (DE) analysis of endo-siRNAs raw read counts for each RNAi library. The R/Bioconductor package DESeq2 (version 1.18.1)26 was used to perform the DE analysis. We filtered for differentially expressed endo-siRNAs with a Benjamini–Hochberg’s27 multiple testing corrected P-value <0.05 and subjected them for downstream analyses. For the DE analysis of mRNAs, we subjected the raw read counts obtained from HTSeq (version 0.9.0)28 to the DESeq2 package and used the same cutoffs as for siRNAs.2.9. Off-target analysisWe created all possible 23-mers from the feeding regions of both ND169 and DCR1 genes, as well as their reverse complement 23-mers. We aligned these 23-mers against the rest of the P. tetraurelia MAC genome (version 2; stock 51). The bowtie223 aligner was used to perform local alignments (- -local) and report up to 100 distinct alignments for each read (-k 100). Further, we identified the genes overlapping with a unique exact match from these alignments.2.10. GO enrichment analysisWe performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis using Ontologizer (version 2.0).29 We utilized the default options of the Ontologizer tool except for setting the options to Benjamini–Hochberg method for multiple testing corrections. GO terms with a corrected P-value < 0.05 are considered statistically significant. All Paramecium genes were used as the population set.3. Results and discussion3.1. Analysis of feeding associated siRNAs of DCR1 and ND169Two genes were silenced by RNAi and this was carried out at two different transcriptomic backgrounds (serotypes) at 31°C for cells expressing serotype 51A and at 24°C for cells expressing serotype 51B. We have chosen DCR1 as it was shown to be involved in transgene-induced silencing as well as dsRNA feeding, which both accumulate 23 nt siRNAs.14,20 23 nt is also the pre-dominant length of endo-siRNAs.16 As a control, we used dsRNA feeding against a gene involved in trichocyst discharge (ND169), which has no known relation with siRNA accumulation.After RNA isolation and sequencing, we first analysed the siRNAs associated with dsRNA feeding. Fig. 1A–D shows coverage plots of the two feeding genes. We can observe the accumulation of primary siRNAs in the feeding regions and a significantly lower amount of secondary siRNAs outside this region. We can confirm that these siRNAs are an effect of feeding, as the siRNAs of these two feeding genes in WT serotypes have low coverage (Supplementary Fig. S1). As the coverage plots represent raw reads, the bar plot in Fig. 1E shows normalized data for the feeding associated siRNAs. DCR1 feeding shows a lower amount of siRNAs compared with ND169 feeding. As DCR1 has been shown to be involved in the feeding pathway,13,30 silencing of DCR1 by feeding could inhibit its own silencing. This form of recursive RNAi could be the reason why we observe lower abundance of primary siRNAs in DCR1 feeding. However, Fig. 1F shows the knockdown efficiency of the target genes by displaying the reduction in fold changes. Both, DCR1 and ND169 silencing lead to mRNA reduction greater than 95%, with DCR1 silencing being particularly efficient.3.2. Endogenous siRNAs in control feeding are not WTWe next analysed the endo-siRNAs of the feeding cultures and compared them to WT cells of the respective serotype fed with regular and non-dsRNA producing bacteria. We took advantage of the recently described genome wide analysis of endo-siRNA producing loci in the vegetative genome of P. tetraurelia, which identified 1,618 endo-siRNA loci overlapping with gene annotations in different serotypes in Paramecium.16 To analyse sRNA abundance in these loci for the different feeding experiments, we normalized the read data using the KDCS method implemented in the RAPID pipeline.22 The KDCS method scales the read counts of each endo-siRNA in a library to the library with highest read counts, after eliminating the feeding associated siRNAs which are usually highly abundant (see Materials and methods). We utilized these normalized read counts of the endo-siRNA loci of all libraries to investigate the clustering pattern of replicates, specific to each serotype (Fig. 2A and B). We noted that WT samples clearly separated from all feeding cultures. It is surprising as the ND169 gene is thought not to be involved in siRNA pathways, we expected ND169 feeding replicates to cluster with WT replicates. We note that WT and feeding cultures differ in the bacterial strains used as food (K. planticola and E. coli, respectively). However, as both belong to the Enterobacteriaceae family and as Paramecium shows almost identical division rates (data not shown), it is unlikely that differences in the observed siRNA composition are due to the food bacteria.Heatmap of normalized sRNA read counts after hierarchical clustering (Euclidean distance measure) of the 1,618 endo-siRNAs (rows) for all replicates (columns) respective to the serotype 51A (A) and 51B (B) is shown.Heatmap of normalized sRNA read counts after hierarchical clustering (Euclidean distance measure) of the 1,618 endo-siRNAs (rows) for all replicates (columns) respective to the serotype 51A (A) and 51B (B) is shown.To get more insight into the differences of end-siRNAs we investigated their abundance distribution. Figure 3A and B shows boxplots visualizing the abundance of endo-siRNAs in all experiments for the two serotypes (replicates were merged). A statistically significant reduction (Wilcoxon test P-value < 0.05) of siRNA abundance is apparent in each feeding culture compared with the WTs without dsRNA diet. In both serotypes, the endo-siRNA accumulation pattern indicates ND169 feeding to be closer to DCR1 silencing than to WTs suggesting that ND169 silencing does not solely affect the ND169 mRNA.Quantification and differential expression of the 1,618 endo-siRNAs.

(C and D) Set intersection plots of differentially expressed endo-siRNA clusters in the knockdown libraries against each wild-type library for 51A, and 51B, respectively.We performed a DE analysis of the endo-siRNAs between the WT and the feeding samples. Figure 3C and D shows a set intersection plot (UpSetR plot31) of the significantly differentially expressed endo-siRNAs (see Materials and methods; Supplementary Table S1), for the two serotypes 51A and 51B, respectively. In serotypes 51A and 51B, the DCR1 feeding samples have 371 and 367 differentially expressed endo-siRNAs, respectively. Of them approximately 70% of the endo-siRNAs (257 in 51A and 254 in 51B) are differentially expressed in ND169 feeding as well, which suggest a common response to exo-dsRNA.We performed a GO enrichment analysis, using the Ontologizer software, to investigate whether genes associated with the differentially expressed endo-siRNAs have any over-represented GO terms (Supplementary Table S1). We identified diverse functions and processes associated with these genes. Following are some of the significantly enriched terms: cofactor metabolic process, Pteridine-containing compound metabolic process, single-multicellular organism process, multicellular organism process, developmental process, and others. These results suggest that feeding interferes with a diverse set of pathways irrespective of the feeding gene.Our results are the first evidence that application of exo-dsRNA alters endo-siRNA accumulation at large scale in Paramecium. One reason could be that exo-dsRNA could have off-targets. We discuss these off-targets in relation with gene expression in the next section. Another reason could be that the massive amounts of exo-dsRNA saturate molecular components of the feeding pathway. Hence, those components which are additionally involved in endogenous regulation of gene expression have lower capacity for their endogenous role. This implies that cell cultures undergoing dsRNA feeding should not be considered WT, at least on the siRNA level.3.3. Feeding of dsRNA causes de-regulation of gene expressionDue to the loss of endo-siRNAs in all feeding experiments, we investigated whether this is accompanied by changes in gene expression. We prepared poly-A enriched libraries for WT and RNAi against two genes, DCR1 and as control ND169. The mRNA libraries of RNAi samples were generated from the respective biological sample used for sRNA libraries. We quantified the gene expression of all the annotated genes of P. tetraurelia using the Salmon software (see Materials and methods). For each serotype, we created a heatmap of the gene expression values (Fig. 4A and B) showing the clustering of replicates. We can observe that WT samples cluster separately in both serotypes. Similar to the analysis of siRNAs (Fig. 2A and B), we observe that there are large changes in the mRNA transcriptome after ND169 and DCR1 feeding. However, the ND169 feeding replicates (except one replicate in serotype 51A) are relatively closer to the WT replicates than what we observed in endo-siRNA accumulation, according to our clustering analysis.Heatmap of mRNA expression after hierarchical clustering (Euclidean distance measure) of all the mRNAs (rows) for all replicates (columns) respective to the serotype 51A (A) and 51B (B) is shown.Heatmap of mRNA expression after hierarchical clustering (Euclidean distance measure) of all the mRNAs (rows) for all replicates (columns) respective to the serotype 51A (A) and 51B (B) is shown.To analyse the differences in mRNA expression in more detail, we first checked the distribution of gene expression (mean of the replicates), visualizing them as boxplots shown in Fig. 5A and B. We observe a statistically significant reduction in the gene expression in the feeding experiments in both serotypes (Wilcoxon test P-value < 0.05). However, unlike the endo-siRNA accumulation (Fig. 3A and B), we can observe a statistically significant difference between the ND169 control feeding and the DCR1 feeding as well in both serotypes. This asserts the observed clustering pattern in Fig. 4. Albeit observing a rather equal amount of endo-siRNA loss in both feeding samples, the loss in mRNA is different among them, with stronger reduction of mRNA expression in DCR1 feeding. One possibility for this behaviour is that many of the produced endo-siRNAs are either spurious or cis inactive Dicer products. It is unclear whether these spurious or cis inactive Dicer products have a different regulatory capacity. However, our earlier work has shown that endo-siRNAs do not cause cis silencing effects, for many loci.16(A and B) Boxplots of genome-wide mRNA expression (y-axis; TPM) of serotype (51A and 51B, respectively) and their knockdowns (ND169 and DCR1).

(C and D) Set intersection plots of differentially expressed (D.E.) mRNA in the knockdown libraries against each wild-type library for 51A, and 51B, respectively.Subsequently, we performed differential gene expression analysis between the WT, and feeding samples (see Materials and methods; Supplementary Table S1). Figure 5C and D shows set intersection plots of the significantly differentially expressed genes (see Materials and methods) for serotypes 51A and 51B, respectively. In both serotypes, DCR1 feeding has the highest and unique set of differentially expressed genes. However, approximately 30–40% of the differentially expressed genes in DCR1 are commonly found in the ND169 control feeding as well. It seems likely that genes, which are uniquely differentially expressed in DCR1, are due to direct effects of DCR1 being involved in endo-siRNA accumulation. In contrast, commonly differentially expressed genes are probably de-regulated as a response to the feeding process rather than the causal effect of the knocked-down gene. Supplementary Fig. S2 shows the MA plots of the up and down-regulated genes in each feeding sample against the WT serotype.GO enrichment analysis of these commonly differentially expressed genes reveals diverse sets of biological processes such as nucleoside phosphate metabolic process, gene expression, biosynthetic processes, ATPase activity, and proteolysis. These results indicate that feeding affects a diverse set of pathways, which seem to be involved in the general depletion of endo-siRNAs and mRNAs that we observe.3.4. Could direct off-target effects cause transcriptomic changes?Another possibility would be that the feeding constructs we used have unintended off-targets triggering a cascade of transcriptomic alterations. We created all possible 23 bp sub-sequences of the feeding-region (see Materials and methods) and aligned them to the rest of the genome. We found five and two exact matching off-target genes for ND169 and DCR1 feeding regions, respectively. The DE status of these genes in the respective library is shown in Supplementary Table S1. Only some of the off-targets are differentially expressed in some of the libraries. With these data we can cautiously conclude that the large number of differentially expressed genes are unlikely to be an off-target effect, but a general response to the massive dsRNA feeding. We want to exercise caution in interpreting this off-target analysis, because a study on Drosophila shows that the sRNA fit to the target must not be over the full length. The Piwi Aubergine targets RNA for slicing with complementarity to the loaded sRNA only from nucleotides 2-16.32 Of course, the shorter the complementary sequence, the more off-target effects could occur. Although, it is unlikely as this would cause a massive cross silencing in the transcriptome, especially if we include 2° siRNAs in this scenario. However, in our off-target analysis we do not observe any 2-16 nt alignments.In our case one of the most likely explanations seems to be an overload of RNAi components by exo-dsRNA, which will then have less capacity for their function in endo-siRNA biogenesis. In addition, we do not see strong regulation of RNAi components in feeding conditions, which could contribute to altered siRNA accumulation. Supplementary Fig. S3 shows the regulation of RNAi components of Paramecium and most of them show indeed a slight down-regulation similar to the entire transcriptome. Among several up and down-regulated RNAi components, the only known feeding component showing a slight up-regulation is RDR2, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. RDR2 is known to be involved in feeding and endo-siRNA accumulation.15,16.Our data about feeding mechanisms in Paramecium document the aberrations of endo-siRNAs and transcriptome for the first time, but our current data do not allow us to decide whether off-target effects are sequence dependent or caused by more indirect effects.3.5. Phased endo-siRNAs show alterations in gene expression in cisFurther, we dissected the endo-siRNAs between loci showing phased siRNAs and such without. Phasing is a process, where long dsRNA precursors are cut into equidistant siRNAs by Dicer or Dicer-like enzymes. However, phased siRNAs are not exclusively due to Dicer cleavage. For instance, piRNA/Ago can also cut a ssRNA into phased siRNAs.33 Among the 1,618 endo-siRNA producing loci in the vegetative genome of P. tetraurelia, 81 and 66 endo-siRNA loci were characterized as phased in serotypes 51A and 51B, respectively.16Figure 6A and B shows the fold change of endo siRNA reads in the feeding sample against the WT. We can observe a statistically significant reduction of phased siRNAs compared with non-phased ones (Wilcoxon test P-value < 0.05) in all samples. In both serotypes, the strongest reduction of phased endo siRNAs can be found in DCR1 silencing. This may fit the involvement of this enzyme in dsRNA feeding and transgene-induced silencing, both of which depend on massive accumulation of phased siRNAs.14,20 As the fold change interpretation (Fig. 6) neglects the absolute abundance, we show in Supplementary Fig. 4 that the abundance of phased endo-siRNAs are higher than the unphased.Dissecting the 1,618 endo-siRNA producing loci depending on their phasing prediction. (A and B) Fold change of the endo-siRNAs read count (y-axis, log2 knockdown/wild type), categorized into phased and unphased loci, is shown for knockdown libraries of serotype 51A, and 51B, respectively.

There were 68, and 48 genes overlapping with the phased endo-siRNAs in serotype 51A and 51B, respectively. Figure 6C and D shows the fold change of mRNA expression in RNAi samples against the WT samples of 51A, and 51B, respectively. We observe a statistically significant difference in mRNA fold changes between the phased and unphased loci in all feeding experiments, except for ND169 feeding in serotype 51B. In other words, genes with unphased endo-siRNAs show reduced expression, whereas many genes with phased endo-siRNAs show more stable mRNA expression compared with WT.In contrast, in our previous work we found that genes overlapping phased endo-siRNA loci showed increased mRNA expression after knockout of RDR2.16 However, we do not observe such an increase in mRNA expression in our feeding experiments. Our data do not allow us to dissect why the loss of endo-siRNA in ND169 feeding of serotype 51B (Fig. 6D) does not cause altered gene expression for phased endo-siRNAs. We do not detect any significant difference neither in sense/antisense bias nor read length distribution (Supplementary Figs 5 and 6).4. ConclusionsIn the past, many studies used RNAi by feeding and also recursive RNAi experiments which were successful in Paramecium, and many other organisms, in the identification of RNAi pathway components. However, usually these approaches used individual reporter genes rather than genome-wide transcriptomic approaches. Our data show that RNAi by feeding causes genome-wide alterations in both the endo-siRNAs and mRNA levels. However, this seems not to be associated with drastic alterations of gene expression at least in cis.Researchers using the feeding technique to study the gene expression caused by RNAi must exercise caution. One must distinguish between the gene expression changes by the genes involved in the feeding pathway and the ones which are merely a response to the feeding technique. The overlap of differentially expressed genes between the control ND169 and DCR1 feeding shown in Fig. 5C and D emphasizes the importance of choosing an appropriate control and using an unrelated gene for silencing seems still the appropriate control whether for a normal knockdown or for recursive RNAi.Our observed endo-siRNA, and mRNA expression changes in Paramecium, due to exo-dsRNA application, complement a recent set of studies that show a large diversity of different off-target effects in other species. Recent evidence reports off-target effects in C. elegans in three different ways including the rescue of mir-35-41 triggered temperature sensitive reduction in progeny viability.34 As we were not able to predict any miRNAs in Paramecium,16 this clearly differs and suggests species-specific off-target effects, which cannot be generalized. A similar study has recently reported that even in mammalian cells a higher overlap between dsRNA induced and miRNA pathways are expected.35 The question remains whether it is true that the high abundance of dsRNA in most feeding approaches is solely responsible for sequence independent off-target effects. It was shown in Paramecium, that even ssRNA from food bacteria (rRNA; mRNA) becomes converted into siRNAs by the feeding pathway.14 One could assume that the food in general, not necessarily dsRNA engineered food, could affect endo-siRNA composition.All of this basic knowledge, which is still fragmented, needs to be considered in biotechnological approaches. An increasing number of studies uses dsRNA produced by bacteria or plants to induce virus resistance or pest-lethality by targeting individual genes on the sequence level. This adds to the discussion whether dsRNA application in the field needs to be considered a genetic manipulation or maybe even an epigenetic manipulation. Usually, RNA-treated organisms are considered GMO-free. Especially in plants, direct application of RNA is very efficient and can be used for trans species silencing of genes in insects, mites and nematodes.36 When introducing massive amounts of RNA in field studies, one should expect more genome-wide effects than those induced by simple homology-dependent silencing of one individual locus.We are grateful to Olivier Arnaiz for help with the new genome annotation, to Gilles Gasparoni for kind assistance with sequencing, to E.

IntroductionThe unusual adult pentameral body plan of echinoderms and how it relates to the bilateral plan of other members of the superphylum Deuterostomia has long been the subject of debate among evolutionary biologists.1–6 This morphology is derived as Cambrian fossils shows that the earliest echinoderms were bilateral as adults.7,8 Although the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying embryo and larval development in echinoderms are well studied, especially for the sea urchin model,5 the molecular basis of metamorphosis and adult body plan development is poorly understood because of the challenge to rear feeding larvae to the juvenile in most species.9,10 Use of direct developing species that metamorphose soon after gastrulation together with application of sequencing technologies, is proving a powerful approach to address questions regarding the development and evolution of pentamery. The developmental transcriptomes of the sea urchins Heliocidaris erythrogramma and H. tuberculata have revealed differences in the embryonic gene regulatory networks of these direct and indirect developers, respectively, and the molecular changes involved with metamorphosis and development of pentamery.11–15After decades of conjecture, the class relationships within the Echinodermata are now supported to comprise the Asterozoa (Asteroidea, Ophiuroidea), the Echinozoa (Echinoidea, Holothuroidea), and the basal Crinozoa (Fig. 1).16 Although echinoids are a major model system for developmental biology, they have many derived traits with respect to the rest of Echinodermata. Early development in most echinoids is characterized by unequal cleavage with tiers of differently sized blastomeres, while in the other echinoderm classes, cleavage is equal. Sea urchins also have two mesodermal lineages, including skeletogenic and pigment cells that are not present in asteroid larval development. They also have the unique echinopluteus larva and the most radical echinoderm metamorphosis forming the juvenile almost entirely of axial elements (skeleton associated with water vascular system elements) with cohesion between the rays.17 An unusual feature of the Echinoidea is the transversion and inversion of their HOX and ParaHOX clusters18,19 with the former suggested to be related to the evolution of the unique sea urchin skeletal test and body form.6 Asteroids, in comparison, have the ancestral-type echinoderm body with distinct and separate rays as well as having the bipinnaria, the ancestral dipleurula-type larva shared with hemichordates (Fig. 1). In addition, the asteroid HOX and ParaHOX clusters are intact and similar to that of other deuterostomes.20,21 Thus, although the Echinoidea is an impressive group for evolution and development (evo-devo) research,14,22 they are less suitable than the Asteroidea to generate insights into the origins and evolution of pentamery in the Echinodermata.6Echinoderm phylogeny showing class relationships, the Asterozoa (Asteroidea, Ophiuroidea), Echinozoa (Echinoidea, Holothuroidea), and basal Crinozoa and indicative relationship with the Hemichordata and Cephalochordata.

Martinez.Research on the molecular and cellular biology of asteroid development has focused on the embryos and larvae of the asterinid sea star Patiria miniata, a species with indirect development and for which extensive genomic resources are available.23,24 To generate insights into the molecular processes underlying adult asteroid development and its radial body plan, we assembled de novo a reference developmental transcriptome for the closely related asterinid, Parvulastra exigua. This direct developing species forms the juvenile soon after gastrulation providing the opportunity to generate thousands of metamorphosing juveniles within 8–10 days.25,Parvulastra exigua has benthic development with hatching delayed until the advanced brachiolaria stage when these larvae have a well-developed attachment complex (brachia and adhesive disc) to ensure that they remain attached to the substratum.25,26 As for H. erythrogramma, 27–29 the evolution of lecithotrophic development in P. exigua has been the focus of studies of alternative larval life history modes in the Echinodermata.25,30–33We used RNA-seq to determine transcription profiles across development in P. exigua incorporating six developmental stages from gastrula [1-day post-fertilization (dpf)] to the definitive juvenile (21 dpf). The transcriptome was used to explore changes in gene expression during metamorphosis and adult body plan development. Differential expression analysis was used to compare gene expression in the gastrula and larvae and between larva and late metamorphic development of the pentameral adult. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that many of the terms enriched in the late metamorphosis stage were related to neural development and signalling. Considering the close relationship between body plan anatomy and central nervous system (CNS) organization,34,35 we investigated the expression profiles of known neurogenesis transcription factors36 over the time course of development. We were interested to determine if there is a suite of adult development-specific neural genes because the adult CNS of P. exigua, as generally the case for sea stars, develops de novo at metamorphosis.37–39 We also explored the spatial expression of some of these genes in the developing CNS and sensory structures. Our developmental RNA-seq analyses captured the changes in gene expression during the metamorphic transition to the pentameral adult body plan and provided a framework to investigate the development and evolution of the unusual echinoderm radial body plan and its deuterostome affinities.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sample collection, RNA preparation, sequencing and microscopyParvulastra exigua were collected near Sydney, Australia. The eggs were obtained by placing dissected ovaries in 10-5 M 1-Methyladenine (Sigma) in filtered sea water (FSW 1.0 µm Millipore) and fertilized using sperm removed from the testes. Three biological replicate cultures were established each using the gametes from multiple parents in completely unique crosses. The embryos and larvae were reared at 20°C as described by Byrne.25 We sampled six developmental stages from each replicate: gastrula (1 dpf), early brachiolaria (3 dpf), hatched brachiolaria with the 5-lobed hydrocele (6 dpf), flexed brachiolaria with the juvenile rudiment region (early metamorphosis) (10 dpf), metamorphic juvenile (12 dpf), and the definitive juvenile (21 dpf) (Fig. 2A–I). The samples were placed in RNAlater (Sigma) and stored frozen at -20°C until use. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA quantity was measured using a NanoDrop and quality was assessed with a BioAnalyzer. Libraries were prepared by Duke Center for Genomic and Computational Biology from 4 µg total RNA per sample using the Illumina Tru-Seq Library Preparation Kit and sequenced on an Illumina Hi-Seq 2000 with 50 bp paired end reads.Parvulastra exigua (live images: A–E; confocal microscope sections: (F–I) including stages used for the developmental transcriptome.

Scale bars = 100 µm.2.2. MicroscopyFor confocal microscopy, specimens were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (ProSciTech, Australia) in filtered seawater (FSW 1.0 µm Millipore) for 1–2 h, washed in FSW, dehydrated in an ethanol series to 70% (v/v) ethanol in Milli-Q water and stored at 4°C. They were then dehydrated to 100% ethanol and cleared in 2:1 (v/v) benzyl benzoate/benzyl alcohol and mounted in a coverslip-sealed chamber. The specimens, autofluorescent from the glutaraldehyde fixation, were viewed in an Olympus FluoView 1000 laser scanning system (v.1.7.1.0) linked to an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope. They were excited at <U+03BB>ex 633 nm with a helium–neon laser and detected at <U+03BB>em 645–745 nm. Developing stages were also photographed using a DF13 Olympus camera mounted on an Olympus BX60 microscope.2.3. Transcriptome assembly and annotationPaired-end RNA-seq reads were generated on six stages of development in three biological replicates. Adapters and low-quality bases with quality value less than 20 were removed with cutadapt version 1.13.40 Any resulting reads shorter than 40 bases were eliminated from further analysis. Assembly of short reads into putative transcripts was performed with Trinity version 2.4.0.41 Default settings were used to produce the reference transcriptome (N50 = 3,676 bp, range of transcript lengths is 201–36,276 bp). To quantitate the assembled transcripts, RSEM version 1.3.042 was used with the paired-end setting and Bowtie243 was used by RSEM to map the reads to the transcriptome. Transcriptome sequences were annotated using BLASTn v. 2.6.044 to the recently released P. miniata genome version 2.0 gene models (www.echinobase.org/Echinobase/PmAbout, May 2017, date last accessed). A transcript was associated with a gene if the match had an e-value <1 × 10-20. The annotated set of transcripts is represented by significant hits to 23,502 unique P. miniata gene models, which include 7,575 distinct gene descriptions of transcripts within the assembly. A tool to visualize gene expression profiles from gastrula to definitive juvenile was developed and is available at http://shiny.maths.usyd.edu.au/starfishTimecourse/.2.4. Variation in gene expression across the six developmental stagesFor time course analyses, transcript abundance estimates were transformed as log2 (FPKM + 1) to remove the relationship between mean and variance. Gene-level analyses were done by choosing the most variable transcript associated with a particular gene. Principal components analysis of these data was carried out using the prcomp function in R version 3.4.2. The reduced dimension representation of gene abundances was plotted using ‘autoplot’ from the CRAN package ggfortify.452.5. Differential expression and GO analysisPairwise differential expression analyses were carried out between gastrula and hatched brachiolaria as well as hatched brachiolaria and late metamorphosis stages. To compare changes in abundance of each gene between timepoints, the read counts of every contig belonging to a particular gene were summed to the gene-level according to the best significant BLAST hit to P. miniata gene models (www.echinobase.org/Echinobase/PmAbout). At least five read counts in two or more samples per gene was required to be included in the pairwise differential expression analyses. After filtering, 13,358 and 13,333 distinct genes (from the total set of 23,502) remained for the gastrula vs. hatched brachiolaria comparison and the stages and the hatched brachiolaria vs. late metamorphosis comparison, respectively. The edgeR package v3.18.146 was used to perform the differential expression analyses. First, read counts were normalized using the calcNormFactors function in edgeR and estimateDisp function was used to estimate dispersion. Differential expression estimates were computed using the package’s exactTest function for each pairwise comparison. Genes with an absolute log2 fold-change =2 and false-discovery rate =5% were considered significantly differentially abundant between developmental stages (Supplementary data 1). Volcano plots were generated with ggplot2.47GO analysis was undertaken to determine which ‘Biological Processes’ were enriched among the up-regulated genes during metamorphosis and juvenile development. GO annotations were retrieved according to significant contig hits (e-value = 1e-20)48 and compiled with Blast2GO49 (Supplementary data 2). The ‘piano’ R package v1.16.450 was used to test for enrichment of GO terms relating to ‘Biological Processes’ in sets of significantly differentially abundant genes between developmental stages on a background set of all P. miniata genes included in the differential expression analysis. REVIGO51 was used to summarize and visualize enriched GO terms from these analyses.2.6. Neural genesAs the GO analysis showed that many of the terms enriched in late metamorphosis were related to neural development we searched the transcriptome for genes that encode transcription factors known to be involved in neurogenesis in echinoderms and other deuterostomes.11,36,52 We analysed the expression profiles of 40 of these genes following a similar analysis of expression through metamorphosis in H. erythrogramma.11 Expression profiles were analysed using the online Shiny application (See Supplementary Fig. 1). We were particularly interested in identifying examples of increase or decrease and peaks of expression during the pre-metamorphic, metamorphic, and post-metamorphic stages. Expression profiles were plotted with R 3.0.3,53 where coloured dots represent the expression values of the three biological replicates (Supplementary Fig. 1).2.7. Whole mount in situ hybridizationSpatial expression of Pax6, Eya, SoxB, and Otx was investigated using whole mount in situ hybridization (WMISH). Specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in DEPC-treated FSW, dehydrated through a graded methanol series and stored in 100% methanol at -20°C. cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and gene-specific primers that were designed based upon sequences obtained from the P. exigua transcriptome. Amplified fragments were cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced to confirmed gene identity. Probes for WMISH were synthesized as described by Byrne et al.38 WMISH followed the methods of Byrne et al.38 with the following amendments. Samples were pre-treated for 30 min in 6% hydrogen peroxide in 100% methanol prior to rehydration. Prior to hybridization, samples were incubated for 5 min in 0.1 M triethanolamine/5 µl/ml acetic anhydride. Probe detection was carried out using NBT/BCIP (Roche) in a detection buffer containing 10% polyvinyl alcohol. Reactions were stopped with several rinses in sterile water. Specimens were then dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, cleared in 1:2 benzyl benzoate/benzoic acid (v/v) and photographed (as above).3. Results3.1. Development of Parvulastra exiguaThe developmental transcriptome time course included six developmental stages of P. exigua: gastrula (1 dpf), early brachiolaria (3 dpf), hatched brachiolaria (6 dpf), early metamorphic brachiolaria (10 dpf), metamorphosing juvenile (12 dpf), and the definitive juvenile (21 dpf) (Fig. 2A–I). This species lays its large eggs on the substratum in adhesive egg masses. The gastrulae and larvae remain within the fertilization envelope until the early brachiolaria larval stage and during this time the left and right coeloms develop (Fig. 2A, B, F, and G). Hatching is delayed until the larval attachment complex allows them to adhere to the substratum (Fig. 2B andC). The larvae have the tripod morphology of benthic sea star larvae with three larval arms equal in length and a hypertrophied attachment disk in the centre (Fig. 2B, C, H, and I). By Day 6, the core of the pentameral body plan, the 5-lobed hydrocoel develops (Fig. 2H andI). During subsequent days the juvenile rudiment develops and becomes evident on external view (Fig. 2D). By 10 dpf the larvae have the oral side of the developing juvenile directed towards the substratum and the adult tube feet are evident externally (Fig. 2D). The larval body is resorbed slowly as metamorphosis proceeds and the juvenile tube feet take over the role of attachment (Fig. 2D). By 21 dpf the definitive juvenile is well established (Fig. 2E).3.2. Variation in gene expression across developmental stagesThe PCA of developmental gene expression across the six stages showed that most of the variation was between the pre-metamorphic stages of development (PC1—62%), whereas only 18% of variation is explained by differences in the metamorphic and post-metamorphic stages (PC2—18%). Thus, PC1 and 2 captured 80% of the total variation within the gene expression dataset. The similarity between the early and late metamorphic and juvenile stages may be due to the prolonged metamorphosis of P. exigua. Variation across the developmental transcriptome distinguished the gastrula expression profile from all other stages (Fig. 3), likely indicative of major morphogenetic processes occurring at this stage of development.Principal component analysis of developmental gene expression across six stages of development in P. exigua. Most variation was between the pre-metamorphic stages (PC1–62%). Only 18% of variation is explained by differences in the metamorphic and post-metamorphic stages (PC2–18%). The PCA distinguishes the gastrula expression profile from all later developmental stages.Principal component analysis of developmental gene expression across six stages of development in P. exigua.

The PCA distinguishes the gastrula expression profile from all later developmental stages.3.3. Differential expressionTo identify which genes had significant changes in expression through P. exigua development, pairwise differential expression analyses were carried out between three stages. We found 2,242 genes with significant differences in expression between gastrula and hatched brachiolaria (Fig. 4A) and 424 genes differentially expressed between hatched brachiolaria and late metamorphosis (Fig. 4A, Supplementary data 1). In terms of both number of genes and magnitude of expression changes, there was far greater differential expression between gastrula and hatched brachiolaria than the later comparison. This result is consistent with the PCA (Fig. 3) in which PC1 clearly separates gastrula from subsequent developmental stages and reflects the key morphogenetic processes that occur during this stage of development. Indeed, among the most enriched GO terms of genes up-regulated at the gastrula stage are ‘RNA splicing’ (P < 4.59e-6) and ‘cell differentiation’ (P < 5.75e-4),Volcano plot of expression changes between (A) gastrula and hatched brachiolaria larva and (B) hatched brachiolaria and late metamorphosis stages. Genes with a log2 fold-change (FC) greater than or equal to 2 and supported by a false-discovery rate (FDR) less than 5% are coloured according to the stage at which they are significantly up-regulated: gastrula (green), hatched brachiolaria (pink), and late metamorphosis (blue).Volcano plot of expression changes between (A) gastrula and hatched brachiolaria larva and (B) hatched brachiolaria and late metamorphosis stages.

Among the most enriched GO biological processes of genes significantly more abundant at late metamorphosis are terms relating to neural development and signalling (Fig. 5, Supplementary data 2). Other GO categories were related to transcription, cell signalling, and ion transport. Expression relating to these biological processes is consistent with development of the CNS and juvenile sensory structures between these two stages of development.Multidimensional scaling plot of semantic similarity matrix generated from the top 30 enriched GO ‘Biological Process’ terms from genes significantly up-regulated during late metamorphosis relative to the hatched brachiolaria (larval) stage.

Temporal expression of neurogenesis transcription factors over developmentThe temporal expression profiles across the six developmental time points for 40 genes known to be involved in neurogenesis are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Specific genes involved in neurogenesis including BarH1, Mbx, Gsx, Otp, FoxB, FoxD, Pax6, Hey, NeuroD, Ngn, and Hnf6 (see 36,52) are among the 311 genes more abundant during late metamorphosis. Although expression varied with respect to patterns of up-regulation or down-regulation over the time course of development, a few distinct profiles were evident (Fig. 6, Supplementary Fig. 1).Temporal expression profiles in P. exigua of putative neurogenic genes in three profiles, (A) Post-gastrula decrease, (B) up-regulation between gastrulation and the early larval stages followed by a decrease and an up-regulation at metamorphosis and juvenile stages, and (C) low expression in pre-metamorphic stages followed by an up-regulation during metamorphosis. The Fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped read (FPKM), log transformed, were plotted for the six developmental stages (see Supplementary Fig. 1).Temporal expression profiles in P. exigua of putative neurogenic genes in three profiles, (A) Post-gastrula decrease, (B) up-regulation between gastrulation and the early larval stages followed by a decrease and an up-regulation at metamorphosis and juvenile stages, and (C) low expression in pre-metamorphic stages followed by an up-regulation during metamorphosis. The Fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped read (FPKM), log transformed, were plotted for the six developmental stages (see Supplementary Fig. 1).A group of important genes (e.g. Otx, Six3/6, Rx, Emx, FoxM, and Dlx) exhibited early up-regulation in the gastrula stage followed by a pre-metamorphic decrease after gastrulation through the larval and metamorphic stages (Fig. 6A). In some of these genes the decrease was not so marked (e.g. Six3/6) and others (e.g. Otx and Dlx) showed some increase in late metamorphosis and the juvenile stages (Fig. 6A).A second striking pattern was seen in up-regulation of expression between gastrulation and the early larva followed by a decline and then by increased expression through metamorphosis and juvenile stages (Fig. 6B). This was seen for Pax6, Otp, FoxD, Eya, and Hey, among others (Fig. 6B, Supplementary Fig. 1).In a third pattern, low expression in pre-metamorphic stages (gastrula to hatched brachiolaria) was followed by an up-regulation during metamorphosis (Days 10 and 12) (Fig. 6C). This included FoxB, BarH1, and Mbx (Fig. 6C), A number of genes that showed various expression profiles during pre-metamorphic development had peak expression in the late metamorphosis and/or the juvenile stages, including Nurr1, Isl, Hnf6, Meis, Pou4f2, ebf3, Gad, and Brn1/2/4 (Supplementary Fig. 1).Finally, some genes were transiently up-regulated in the early larval stage e.g. Ngn, Hey, Otp, and FoxD (Supplementary Fig. 1). Nkx2.1 had the highest expression at the gastrula and early brachiolaria stages with down-regulation thereafter (Supplementary Fig. 1).3.5. Spatial expression of neurogenesis genes in the metamorphic juvenileThe asteroid CNS is located on the surface ectoderm (i.e. not covered in skeleton as in other echinoderms) and so spatial gene expression in the radial nerve cord and associated sensory structures (eye spot, tube feet) are evident on surface view. In situ hybridization indicated that the expression domain of Otx became focussed to the CNS (Fig. 7A). Otx has high temporal expression in early embryos (Fig. 6A) and its lower expression in later development indicates down-regulation. However, Otx is strongly expressed in the developing CNS (Fig. 7A). Eya is up-regulated during metamorphosis (Fig. 6B) and its expression domain is also associated with the CNS (Fig. 7B). The temporal expression of Pax6 increases during metamorphosis and in the juvenile (Fig. 6B). This gene is strongly expressed in the eye spot at the end of the radial nerve cord and in the pairs of tube feet (Fig. 7D). SoxB1 is also expressed in the tube feet and eye spot (Fig. 7C). This gene has a uniform high expression through development (Supplementary Fig. 1).In situ hybridization of spatial expression of neurogenic genes in the developing juvenile P. exigua.

DiscussionThe bilateral larva to pentameral juvenile metamorphic transition heralds a distinct phase in gene expression in P. exigua, as also the case for the sea urchin H. erythrogramma,11 and other marine invertebrates that undergo a larva to juvenile metamorphic transition.54. This highlights the distinct larval and adult developmental modules and their likely association with distinct gene regulation. The transcriptomic resources developed here for P. exigua, and previously for H. erythrogramma,11,14 with extensive coverage of the metamorphic stages, provide the basis to investigate changes in gene expression during development of pentamery and to explore deuterostome affinities of the unique echinoderm body plan.The PCA showed that gene expression in the gastrula stage of P. exigua was separate from that in the other stages, as also found for H. erythrogramma.11). This was also reflected in the differential gene expression analysis and may be explained in the regulation of tissue specification and unique morphogenetic processes that occur during gastrulation.55 The PCA also showed that gene expression was less variable across the metamorphic and juvenile stages compared with the pre-metamorphic stages. In contrast, the change in gene expression associated with metamorphosis in H. erythrogramma is more temporally marked.11 This difference may be due to the benthic mode development in P. exigua where metamorphosis is slow (over 5–7days).25 The larvae remain attached as their body degenerates in parallel with development of the adult podia. In H. erythrogramma, the metamorphic transition following settlement of the planktonic larva is much shorter.11 For P. exigua, it was surprising, that gene expression in the older definitive juvenile (21days old) was not more distinct compared with the metamorphic stages (10 and 12days old).We investigated the larva–juvenile transition in GO analysis of differential gene expression between pre-(hatched brachiolaria) and post-metamorphic (late metamorphosis) stages. Differential expression analysis demonstrates an especially pronounced up-regulation in expression of many genes at late metamorphosis relative to hatched brachiolaria in terms of both fold-change magnitude and number of genes (311) (Supplementary Data 1). This result reflects a large transcriptomic shift associated with the life history transition to a benthic juvenile. Many of the GO terms enriched in differentially expressed genes were related to neural development, as also found for H. erythrogramma.11 Many of the genes known to be expressed during development of the sea urchin larval nervous system36 were expressed in P. exigua (Supplementary Fig. 1). High expression of Nkx2.1 in the gastrulae and early larvae of P. exigua is similar to the timing of expression of this gene in development of the feeding larvae in echinoids and asteroids where it is associated with patterning the larval nervous system.56,57 For P. exigua expression of Nkx2.1 in the gastrula and early brachiolaria may be associated with development of the larval nervous system,58 although this system is reduced in the benthic larva of this species. In addition, high expression of Rx and Six3/6 at the gastrula stage is consistent with the stage of expression of these genes in P. miniata where they are involved in establishment of neurogenic territories in the larva.23 For Otx, up-regulation during gastrulation in P. exigua is likely to be due to its conserved function in endoderm development during this embryonic stage in sea stars.59,60There does not appear to be a set of larva or adult specific neural genes in P. exigua, as also for H. erythrogramma.11,15 The bimodal-like pattern of expression with initial up-regulation between gastrula and early larvae followed by a decrease and then up-regulation during metamorphosis and remaining high in the post-metamorphic juvenile was seen many of the neural transcription factor genes. This indicates roles for these genes in embryogenesis and juvenile development.We expected that renewal of neurogenesis as the adult nervous system develops during metamorphosis38 would be associated with up-regulation of neural transcription factors. Indeed, for P. exigua, a suite of neural genes was more richly expressed during metamorphosis and post-metamorphosis. The P. exigua and H. erythrogramma transcriptomes provide an opportunity for an asteroid–echinoid comparison with respect to genes that may be involved with CNS development as well as patterning the pentameral body, as these processes occur simultaneously. In H. erythrogramma genes that peak during rudiment development include SoxC, Barh1, Hnf6, Sp8, and Meis and those that peak after metamorphosis in the juvenile include Mbx, Isl, Nurr1, Pou4f, and Otp.11 These genes exhibited a similar expression pattern in P. exigua but were more spread across the rudiment and juveniles stages, likely due to the gradual metamorphosis of this species. Thus, despite the ~500 million-yr-old asteroid–echinoid divergence from a common ancestor, there is strong conservation in expression of neural transcription factors in metamorphosis and juvenile development. This indicates the essential roles of these genes during these life history stages, a suggestion that needs to be addressed through functional studies. It will be of interest to compare the expression of neural transcription factors in the adult asteroid and echinoid from biological and functional perspectives and their differential expression with respect to body plan and neurogenesis.As CNS morphogenesis parallels the development of pentamery, exploring potential links between these two will be informative. In P. exigua, Hox4, a gene deleted from the sea urchin HOX cluster, is expressed in the hydrocoel lobes in the larva and in the developing CNS post-metamorphosis, as is Engrailed.38,61 We show here that Otx and Eya, and previously,38 that Eng are also expressed in the developing CNS of this species. In H. erythrogramma Six1/2 is expressed in the hydrocoel lobes and in the developing CNS and other putative neurogenic genes (e.g. Eya, Tbx2/3, and Msx) are also expressed in hydrocoel development.15,Pax6, Otx, and Six3/6 are expressed in the developing sea urchin CNS.13,62–64 The spatial expression domain of Otx is focussed on the CNS during metamorphosis. This shows the importance of determining the spatial expression of transcription factor genes which otherwise appear to be down-regulated in transcriptome analysis, as noted for retinal determination genes in sea urchin development.13In P. exigua, Pax6 is strongly expressed in the eye spot at the tip of the radial nerve cord where it ends at the primary podium and in the tube feet, structures that are considered to be photosensory.13,65 This is consistent with expression of Pax6 in photosensory structures in diverse species.66,67 In H. erythrogramma and other sea urchins Pax6 is expressed in the primary podia and tube feet.13,65While most research on echinoderm neurogenesis has focussed on the larval nervous system, with many fundamental advances and discoveries made,23,52,68 this structure is not considered to be relevant to discussions on relationships with the chordate nervous system.69 Although adult echinoderms are not cephalized, their CNS has many structural similarities with the chordate nerve cord.70–72 For example, the oral nerve ring and radial nerve cord have a neuroepithelium containing nerve cell bodies and an axonal neuropil with glial cells, analogous to the grey and white matter of the vertebrate spinal cord, respectively.71,73 With respect to spatial expression of neural genes, the open ambulacral system of the Asteroidea with the CNS in the surface ectoderm is particularly amenable to compare cell and tissue level molecular biology of the echinoderm nervous system with that of the chordates.As basal deuterostomes, echinoderms are in a phylogenetic position key to understanding evolutionary origins of the chordate nervous system. The timing of expression of many neural transcription factors coincided with CNS development indicating conserved roles in nerve cord patterning. However, their location of expression and function in adult echinoderm neurogenesis remain to be determined. It appears that a focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying development of the adult echinoderm CNS will be informative with respect to determining chordate affinities.The echinoid–asteroid comparisons made here, based on temporal expression patterns in developmental transcriptome analysis are only indicative, but the genomic resources for P. exigua (this study) and H. erythrogramma11,14 provide the tools to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying development of the adult echinoderm and its unusual pentameral body plan in basal (Asteroidea) and more derived (Echinoidea) classes. In addition, the ability to readily generate 1000s of metamorphic and juvenile stages of these direct developing species presents a unique model system for detailed spatial studies of gene expression in the development of pentamery and the biological processes underlying echinoderm–deuterostome affinities and evolution.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.Thanks to L.

Viral genomes typically encode three types of protein: proteins for replicating the genome, proteins for packing the genome, and proteins for modifying the function of the host’s cell to enhance the replication of the virus’s material.2,3Viruses are believed to play a central role in evolution,4 (e.g. via horizontal gene transfer2,5–7), be responsible for various human diseases (e.g. AIDS and respiratory diseases8,9), and also have important applications to biotechnology10 and nanotechnology.11 For instance, the recent Zika virus (ZIKV) epidemic in the Americas have led the World Health Organization to declare a ‘public health emergency of international concern’,12,13 and just recently the novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) outbreak in China was declared pandemic by the same organization.14 Due to their complete reliance on the host gene expression machinery, viruses are under constant evolutionary pressure to effectively interact with the host intracellular factors, and at the same time effectively evade its immune system.3,15 Thus, understanding how viruses co-evolve with their hosts to ensure their fitness may help in developing novel viral based applications such as vaccines, oncologic therapies, and anti-bacterial treatments.It is natural to expect that viruses and hosts co-evolution patterns are also encrypted in the viral genome. For example, it was shown that high correlation of GC content exists between bacteriophage and related hosts,16 that a pattern of CpG dinucleotides is suppressed in vertebrate hosts and in their related RNA viruses,17,18 that the frequency of TpA dinucleotides is suppressed in invertebrate hosts and in their related RNA viruses,19 and that many long sequences are shared between hosts and their related viruses.20,21Identification and analysis of short DNA sequences that are under-represented (also referred to as suppressed or avoided) in genomes of different species were analysed in the past.22,33 For example, in,22 Markov chain models were used to analyse short sequences in the DNA of two hosts: Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis. Markovian models were used in23 to predict the frequencies of short sequences and applied them to many prokaryotic species, and the authors in24 introduced an efficient algorithm to identify sequences that are avoided.In this paper, we analyse under-represented nucleotide sequences in the coding regions of all types of viruses and in the coding regions of their corresponding hosts using a novel statistical framework. These sequences are analysed separately in each of the three reading frames. We provide a large database of these sequences, identify unique and interesting patterns within these sequences, and demonstrate how these sequences can be utilized to attenuate the ZIKV via in vitro and in vivo experiments.2 Materials and methodsIn this section, we briefly describe the main steps of our methodology. A detailed description appears in the Supplementary document.2.1 Analysis flow overviewThe general flow of our analysis is depicted in Fig. 1A. The dataset of virus–host associations was retrieved from previously published data.34 These include 2,625 unique viruses and 439 corresponding hosts, where all the corresponding coding sequences were downloaded and processed. Randomization models were used to generate many random variants of the host and virus coding sequences. Two different randomization models were used, each control for different biases. A dinucleotide randomization model preserves both amino-acid order and content and the distribution of all 16 possible pairs of nucleotides, whereas a synonymous codon randomization model preserves both amino-acid order and content, and the codon usage bias. These were then used to statistically infer short nucleotide sequences that are under-represented within both the original host and virus genome coding regions, in each reading frame, and those that are common to all three reading frames. These under-represented sequences were analysed and compared among different viral groups and viral proteins, revealing some interesting evolutionary patterns that will be discussed later on. Based on this analysis, an attenuated variant of the ZIKV was engineered and its attenuation was demonstrated in cell lines and in mice.

Figure 1B depicts the six host domains in the database (vertebrates, bacteria, fungi, metazoa, planta, and protists), where we specify for each host domain the portion of the corresponding viruses belonging to each virus type. The virus types in the database are reverse-transcribing (retro), double-stranded DNA (dsDNA), double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), single-stranded DNA (ssDNA), single-stranded RNA (ssRNA, positive and negative sense), and other (unclassified).2.3 Randomization models and statistical analysisThe question that we must first address is: what constitutes an under-represented sequence in a coding region? To detect sequences that are statistically under-represented in the coding regions, our statistical background model must capture well-understood coding region features, which are known to be under selection. For example, selection for codon usage bias may cause few short sequences to be in low abundance in the coding regions (as opposed, for example, to regions that are not translated). This, however, does not imply that these short sequences were directly selected against by evolutionary forces. Our definition of under-represented short nucleotide sequences in the coding region must then be formulated with respect to all known coding region features (i.e. amino-acids content and order, codon usage bias, and dinucleotide distribution), to suggest possibly new evolutionary forces acting on the viral coding regions.To that end, two randomization models were used to evaluate our hypothesis for short, under-represented nucleotide sequences in the coding regions of the viruses and in the coding regions of their corresponding hosts. The first, called dinucleotide randomization, preserves both amino acid order and content (and thus the resulting protein), and the frequencies of the 16 possible pairs of adjacent nucleotides (dinucleotides). The second, called synonymous codon randomization preserves both amino-acids order and content (and thus the resulting protein) and the codon usage bias. Figure 1C depicts a schematic description of both randomization methods.A selection against short nucleotide sequences that cannot be explained by the canonical genomic features that are preserved by both randomization models implies that these sequences will appear more frequently in the random variants (generated by the above randomization models) than in the original genome. Empirical P-values were derived from the empirical null model defined by the above two randomization models. The P-value estimates the probability of obtaining a random value (i.e. the number of occurrences of a sequence in the coding regions) that is the same or larger than the observed value in the original genome. This was performed separately in each of the three reading frames. A sequence was declared under-represented if its P-values corresponding to the two randomization models were both =0.05. Note that in the case of synonymous codon randomization, no under-represented sequence of size three nucleotides can be identified in the first reading frame.Specifically, when analysing under-represented sequences in the viruses, we compared the original genome to 1,000 corresponding randomization variants generated by each of the randomization models described above. Under-represented sequences were then identified separately in each reading frame. In addition, common under-represented nucleotide sequences were identified (i.e. sequences that are under-represented in all three reading frames—see Supplementary document, Section 1.4.1). This may indicate selection against sequences that may ‘interfere’ with the process of mRNA translation. See Supplementary document, Sections 1.4 and 2.3 for an additional method of identifying under-represented sequences in the viruses based on the corresponding hosts (i.e. host-based as oppose to random-based analysis).Due to the large size of the host genome, the analysis of under-represented sequences in the hosts was performed differently than in the viruses. Instead, the hosts were analysed relative to their corresponding viruses. Recall that a host can be infected by several viruses. Specifically, for each pair of a host and a corresponding virus (i.e. a virus that infects that host), we randomly sampled the host coding sequences with a sample size equals the total size of the virus coding sequences. Twenty host samples were used for each host–virus pair. Each sample was compared with 1,000 corresponding randomization variants generated by each of the random models. Thus, twenty sets of under-represented sequences were identified in the host, for each reading frame, given a corresponding virus. A sequence that is under-represented in at least ten of the twenty samples, per reading frame, is then considered as under-represented in the host, given the corresponding virus. This is referred to as the sampled majority under-represented set of the host given a corresponding virus (see Supplementary document, Section 1.4.2). The final set of sequences that are under-represented in the host was defined by the intersection over all the corresponding viruses. See more details in Supplementary document, Section 1.4.2.4 Preparation of synthetic attenuated ZIKV vaccine based on under-represented oligosThe genome of a Thai-strain ZIKV from an infectious-clone plasmid35 was evaluated to uncover under-represented sequences (see Supplementary document, Section 1.8 for more details on the ZIKV strain). First, the two randomized models (dinucleotides and synonymous codons) were used on the ZIKV coding sequence to identify short sequences that are under-represented. Next, oligos of five nucleotides (5-mers) that were identified by both models and showed significant P-values were selected and ranked according to their significance level (see the list of oligos detected in Supplementary document, Section 2.7). Following, the sequence of the Thai strain ZIKV NS5 protein was systematically scanned at the nucleotide level (according to the significance in the relevant frame) to identify locations that can be modified with each 5-mer, but without affecting the amino acid sequence of the protein (Fig. 2). Specifically, we were able to identify and introduce 29 synonymous codon changes in the first reading frame, and 70 synonymous codon changes in the second reading frame. A general scheme of engineering a synthetic sequence. Specifically, in the case of the synthetic ZIKV UR99 sequence, we introduced different under-represented 5-mer oligo in the first two reading frames (identified using both randomization models), replacing the original nucleotide sequence while verifying that the protein AA sequence remains unchanged.A general scheme of engineering a synthetic sequence. Specifically, in the case of the synthetic ZIKV UR99 sequence, we introduced different under-represented 5-mer oligo in the first two reading frames (identified using both randomization models), replacing the original nucleotide sequence while verifying that the protein AA sequence remains unchanged.The modified NS5 sequence (hereafter named UR99) was later synthesized as plasmid DNA, amplified by PCR, and used to build ZIKV-UR99 strain by Gibson assembly.36 The first-passage stock virus was produced using Vero cells.Synthetic strain preparation: The infectious-clone plasmid of the Thai-strain ZIKV was constructed from PCR products of viral cDNA. The transfection of the plasmid into mammalian cells generated infectious virus with replication kinetics similar to those of the original virus. The sequence of the infectious-clone plasmid was indeed verified.35 The viral sequence from this infectious-clone plasmid was evaluated to uncover under-represented sequences as discussed above.Cell lines: BHK21 with rtTA3 was used to generate virus from assembled DNA.37 The supernatant from the transfected BHK21 was then used to infect Vero cells to prepare the virus stock for subsequent experiments. Replication kinetics of the wild-type (WT) virus and the UR99 virus were characterized in Vero cells with MOI = 0.01. The infectious titre was quantitated with Vero cells using immunostaining against E protein by 4G2 monoclonal antibodies.Animals: The 45 male and female AG129 mice produced by an in-house colony were used. Groups of animals of both genders were randomly assigned to experimental groups and individually marked with ear tags. Animals were challenged with Malaysian ZIKV, ZIKV WT synthetic, UR99, or vehicle. Serum was collected from all mice 14 dpi for assessment of neutralizing antibodies (neutAbs) via PRNT assay. Mice were monitored for mortality and disease signs daily. Individual weights were recorded daily throughout the course of the study.Virus: WT ZIKV (Malaysian strain, P6-740) was prepared by two passages in Vero cells. A challenge dose of ~100 CCID50 was administered via s.c. injection in a volume of 0.1 ml. The virus was generated from the same infectious-clone plasmid as the designed variants.Quantification of neutAb: neutAb was quantified using a 50% plaque reduction neutralization titre (PRNT50) assay. Serum samples were heat inactivated at 56°C for 30 min in a water bath. One half serial dilution, starting at a 1/10 dilution of test sera was made. Dilutions were then mixed 1:1 with an appropriate titre of ZIKV in MEM containing 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) and incubated at 4°C overnight. The virus-serum mixture was then added to individual wells of a 12-well tissue culture plate with Vero76 cells (4e5 cells/well). Viral adsorption proceeded for 1 h at 37°C and 5% CO2, followed by addition of 1.7% (4,000 cps) methylcellulose overlay medium containing 10% FBS to each well. Plates were incubated for 4 days, and then stained with crystal violet [with 1% (wt/vol) crystal violet in 10% (vol/vol) ethanol] for 20 min. The reciprocal of the dilution of test serum that resulted in >50% reduction in average plaques from virus control was recorded as the PRNT50 value.3 Results and discussion3.1 ResultsTo identify short under-represented nucleotide sequences, we compared the number of appearances of each 3, 4, and 5 nucleotides sequences in each reading frame of the original genome with many corresponding randomization variants. Our randomization models preserve the basic canonical features of the coding sequences, i.e. amino-acids composition, codon usage bias, and dinucleotide distribution (see Section 2.3). Thus, an under-represented sequence cannot be explained by these canonical features and may be selected against by other evolutionary forces.To estimate the false discovery rate, we performed two separate evaluations. First, we generated 10,000 randomizations (instead of 1,000) for few randomly selected viruses and verified that under-represented sequences that were detected using 1,000 randomizations were also detected using 10,000 randomizations. In the second evaluation, we performed identifications of under-represented sequences in random variants of the viruses (rather than in the original genome). Specifically, a random variant of each virus was randomly selected, and the P-value was evaluated relative to this (random) variant (see Supplementary document, Section 1.4.1.1). Comparing the number of under-represented sequences identified in the original viruses and the randomized variants of the viruses yields an estimation of a false discovery rate of 1.38% (for m = 3), 1.39% (for m = 4), and 1.43% (for m = 5).The under-represented sequences identified were further processed by analysing different virus and host groups. Specifically, we analysed under-represented sequences for each virus group, for each host domain, for all viruses that corresponds to the same host, and for different combinations of host domains and virus groups (see Supplementary document, Section 1.5). A complete list of the most abundant under-represented sequences among the different virus groups is available in Supplementary Table S2.In addition, we refined our analysis of under-represented sequences in the viruses by analysing different protein groups. We classified all viral genes into five mutually exclusive functional groups [surface, structural, enzymatic, unknown (unclassified genes), and other (hypothetical genes)] and showed that the selection against short nucleotide sequences depends on the viral protein function.Finally, we performed a test study using ZIKV, where we engineered under-represented sequences into the genome of an Asian ZIKV and studied their effect both in vitro and in vivo.Figure 3A and B depicts the average number of under-represented sequences of size m = 3, 4, and 5 nucleotides, identified in few subsets of viruses in both the original and random variants of the virus. See Supplementary document, Section 1.5 for details about the different subsets, and Supplementary document, Section 1.4.1.1 for generating random variants of viruses. As shown in the figures, the average number does indeed increase with the sequence size. Also, many under-represented sequences are found in dsDNA viruses that infect bacteria and vertebrate hosts. The average number of under-represented sequences found in the random variants of the viruses is between 1 and 2% of the average number found in the original genome, suggesting a false discovery rate <2%.

For example, ssRNA: Pl denotes all ssRNA viruses that infect hosts of domain plants.Average number of under-represented sequences of size m = 3, 4, and 5 nucleotides.

For example, ssRNA: Pl denotes all ssRNA viruses that infect hosts of domain plants.Since the genome of dsDNA viruses tend to be on average larger than the genome of RNA viruses, we aimed at evaluating if the larger number of under-represented sequences identified can be simply attributed to a better statistical signal due to the larger nucleotide size of these viruses. A sampling analysis that we performed (see Supplementary document, Section 2.8) suggests that the number of under-represented sequences identified in dsDNA viruses matches their genomic size, when compared with RNA viruses.A complete list of under-represented sequences of sizes m = 3, 4, and 5 nucleotides in all viruses in the database is available in Supplementary Table S3 (random-based) and in Supplementary Table S4 (host-based).Our analysis suggests that among the most abundant common under-represented nucleotide sequences (i.e. sequences that are under-represented in all three reading frames) are homooligonucleotide repeats, specifically in viruses. These are sequences of the form XX.X, where all X contain the same nucleotide. Figure 4A depicts the most abundant common under-represented sequences in the five host domains (left figure) and in the five main virus groups (right figure).

A maximum of 15 sequences are shown in each panel ordered top to bottom based on their occurrence frequency (i.e. top sequence appeared most frequently as common under-represented).Note that among these, specifically in viruses, are sequences containing the same nucleotide repeated m = 3, 4, or 5 times (i.e. sequences that correspond to the same colour repeating m times in the figure). A finer resolution of these common under-represented sequences is provided in Fig. 4B, where we depict these sequences separately for different subsets of hosts (left figure) and subsets of viruses (right figure). See Supplementary document, Section 1.5 for more details of the different subsets.Table 1 lists the six most abundant common under-represented nucleotide sequences of size m = 3, 4, and 5 in dsDNA viruses. All homooligonucleotide sequences (shown in red coloured text) are among these most abundant sequences. The six most abundant common under-represented nucleotide sequences of size m = 3, 4, and 5 in dsDNA viruses (and their abundance in percentage)Red colour indicates homooligonucleotide repeats.The six most abundant common under-represented nucleotide sequences of size m = 3, 4, and 5 in dsDNA viruses (and their abundance in percentage)Red colour indicates homooligonucleotide repeats.One possible reason for this general selection against homooligonucleotide (in all three reading frames) in both viruses and hosts is to reduce erroneous frame shifts as ribosomes traverse the mRNA while decoding it codon by codon. A sequence containing a repetition of the same nucleotide in the coding sequence may cause the ribosome to miss the codon boundary, resulting in a frame shift and thus a non-functional and most likely deleterious protein.2,38 This must be recognized and degraded by energy-consuming intracellular proteolytic mechanisms. Since translation is the most energetically consuming process in the cell, it is believed that transcripts undergo selection to minimize this energy cost.39–43 Selection against sequences of repetitive nucleotides reduces faulty translation, thus minimizing the overall translation cost.It is possible that this selection against homooligonucleotide repeat is indeed more pronounced in viruses than in hosts since viruses are under much stronger evolutionary selection as they have a larger effective population size and thus a stronger effect of these types of mutations on their fitness. Another possible reason may be related to different host immune evasion mechanisms used by viruses (see Section 3.2).We also evaluated the sequence overlap between common under-represented sequences in viruses and transcription factor binding sites and again found a general selection against homooligonucleotide repeats. These are reported in Supplementary document, Section 2.4.A nucleotide sequence is called palindromic if it is identical to its reverse complement. Obviously, palindromic sequences are of even length. Our analysis reveals that 32.5% of all common under-represented sequences of size m = 4 nucleotides in viruses are palindromes. Excluding homooligonucleotide repeats this becomes ~51%. Note that only 6.25% of all possible sequences of size m = 4 nucleotides are palindromes. We also evaluated the number of palindromes in random variants of the viruses. These random variants preserve basic transcript features such as amino-acid order and content, codon usage bias and dinucleotide distributions. Only 5.7% of all common under-represented sequences of size m = 4 in the random variants of the viruses were found to be palindromes. These findings suggest that indeed the coding regions of viruses are selected against short palindrome sequences.Figure 5A and B depicts the percentage of palindromic sequences of size m = 4 nucleotides that are common under-represented sequences in subsets of hosts and viruses. It was found that palindromic sequences are selected against only in one subset of hosts: bacterial hosts that are infected by dsDNA viruses. In addition, palindromic sequences were found to be selected against in dsDNA viruses that infect either bacteria (i.e. bacteriophage) or vertebrate hosts.44,45Under-represented palindrome sequences.

Shown also are the corresponding P-values.As depicted in Fig. 5A and B, the sequence GATC is the most abundant palindromic common under-represented sequence in bacteriophages. GATC is a recognition site of different restriction-modification systems, as well as solitary methyltransferase Dam. In addition, methyl-directed Type II DpnI enzyme cleaves methylated GATC sequences. Previous work28 hypothesized that GATC avoidance in bacteria can result from a DNA exchange between strains with different methylation status of GATC site within the process of natural transformation (see also32).Figure 5C and D depicts the total number of occurrences of each palindrome as under-represented sequence in dsDNA viruses that infect bacteria and vertebrate hosts, respectively. In these sub-figures we analysed under-represented sequences regardless of reading frames. Two cases are shown: the case where the real virus genome is used (shown in blue colour), and the case where a randomized variant of the virus genome is used (shown in red colour). Note the scale difference in the y-axis between the real and the randomized results. The results in the figures imply that dsDNA viruses undergo selection against short palindrome sequences.It has been proposed that the principal underlying reason for the apparent avoidance of short palindromes in dsDNA viruses is because they are targets for many restriction-modification systems and possibly for general recombination systems as well.25,29,31,46,47 Restriction-modification systems protect bacteria and archaea from attacks by bacteriophages and archaeal viruses. A restriction-modification system specifically recognizes short sites in foreign DNA and cleaves it, while such sites in the host DNA are protected by methylation.To evaluate the hypothesis of palindromes avoidance in viruses due to restriction-modification systems, we downloaded all restriction enzyme patterns from the REBASE48 database (we used version 811, which contains information for 952 different restriction enzymes) and evaluated the overlap between the common under-represented nucleotide sequences we identified and the restriction sites from REBASE. Figure 5E depicts the number of exact matches between the most abundant common under-represented palindrome sequences of size m = 4 nucleotides in dsDNA viruses and restriction sites. The figure also depicts the corresponding enzyme name and the P-value for each common under-represented sequence. The P-value was computed by evaluating the match between common under-represented sequences of random variants of the viruses and the restriction sites. Figure 5F depicts the number of restriction sites that are supersets of the most abundant common under-represented palindrome sequences. P-Values were computed as in the case of an exact match.To show that the correspondence between selection against short palindromic sequences in viruses and restriction sites cannot be explained by basic coding region features such as amino-acid content and order, codon usage bias and dinucleotide distribution, we also evaluated the overlap between restriction sites and common under-represented sequences of random variants of viruses. This is reported in Supplementary document, Section 2.5. A complete list of all common under-represented palindromes of size m = 4 is provided in Supplementary Table S6.Figure 6 depicts the number of common under-represented nucleotide sequences identified in different subsets of hosts and viruses. Common under-represented sequences were only identified in two subsets of hosts. On the other hand, common under-represented sequences were identified in all eight subsets of viruses.

A, B, and C correspond to sequences of size m = 3, 4, and 5 nucleotides, respectively, where in each panel the left sub-figure corresponds to subsets of hosts and the right sub-figure to subsets of viruses.Our analysis reveals that dsDNA viruses infecting bacteria and vertebrate hosts have the largest number of common under-represented sequences among the different virus subsets. This, as suggested above, seems to be due to the size of dsDNA viruses when compared with ssDNA and RNA viruses. On the other hand, bacteria that are infected by dsDNA viruses have the largest number of common under-represented sequences among the different host subsets. Thus, the stronger selection for under-represented sequences in bacteria may induce stronger selection for under-represented sequences in viruses that utilize this host.In addition, we evaluated the number of under-represented sequences identified in the real genome of the viruses when compared with the randomized genome of the viruses. This is reported in Supplementary document, Section 2.9. Indeed, many more sequences are identified as under-represented in the real genome of the virus. On average over all viruses and the three sequence sizes, there are ~45 STDs more under-represented sequences in the real genome in comparison to the random genomes, implying that these cannot be explained by basic coding region features, and suggesting possibly new evolutionary forces acting on the viral coding regions.We analysed the correspondence of the under-represented nucleotide sequences between hosts and their related viruses. Specifically, for each pair of a host and a corresponding virus we identified three different classes of sequences:Sequences that are common under-represented in both the host coding regions and in the corresponding virus coding regions.Sequences that are common under-represented in the corresponding virus coding regions but are not common under-represented in the host coding regions.Sequences that are common under-represented in the host coding regions but are not common under-represented in the corresponding virus coding regions.Note that since we analyse each pair of a host and a corresponding virus separately, the set of under-represented sequences in a host above is the sampled majority under-represented set.For obvious reasons, sequences that are not under-represented in both host and virus coding regions constitute the majority of the sequences and are thus not reported here. A complete list of all under-represented sequences within the three classes above for all hosts and viruses in our database is available in Supplementary Table S5.In general, an under-represented sequence of m nucleotides may contain sub-sequences that are themselves under-represented. Thus, it may be interesting to identify unique under-represented sequences, i.e. sequences that do not contain any sub-sequences that are under-represented. For each pair of a host and a corresponding virus, a sequence belonging to one of the three classes above is referred to as a unique under-represented sequence if it does not contain any sub-sequence that is under-represented in that class. Specifically, a unique common under-represented sequence of size m = 4 (m = 5) nucleotides doesn’t contain any sub-sequence of size m = 3 (of size m = 3 and of size m = 4) nucleotides that is common under-represented sequences. A complete list of all unique common under-represented sequences within the three classes above for all hosts and viruses in the database is available in Supplementary Table S7.The correspondence of the most abundant under-represented sequences between viruses and their related hosts is depicted in Fig. 7 for different host and virus subsets. Each panel depicts both the most abundant common under-represented sequences (left) and the most abundant unique common under-represented sequences (right), where the panel names correspond to the class names. Our first observation is that many under-represented sequences are indeed unique. For example, comparing the cases of m = 4 and m = 5 of class A (left sub-figure middle and bottom rows, respectively) with the corresponding unique set (right sub-figure top and bottom rows, respectively) reveals that the majority of the most abundant sequences is unique. Second, homooligonucleotide repeats are among the most abundant sequences in all three classes. In addition, more sequences were identified in class B over the different subsets than in the other two classes. For example, Table 2 lists the most abundant unique sequence of classes B and C in all the different subsets of hosts and viruses. As shown in the table, unique sequences were identified in all subsets in class B, as oppose to class C. The most abundant common under-represented nucleotide sequences that are shared between hosts and their corresponding viruses in different subsets of hosts and viruses. (A) Class A sequences (left) of size m = 3 (top panel), m = 4 (middle panel), and m = 5 (bottom panel), and unique class A sequences (right) of size m = 4 (top panel) and m = 5 (bottom panel).

X indicates that no corresponding sequence was identified.The viral genome encodes different types of proteins that are necessary for the life cycle of viruses in their respective hosts. These, in general, include surface proteins that interact with the host receptors and enable attachment and entry to the host cell, structural proteins that serve as the building blocks of the virus, and replicating enzymes, such as RNA and DNA polymerase, that are required for the replication of the virus. In addition, many other proteins, some of which are uncharacterized, are diversely involved in different regulatory and accessory functions.Here, our aim is to refine the analysis of under-represented sequences in viruses by analysing, separately, different protein groups. To that end, and similarly to,21 we classified all viral genes into five mutually exclusive functional groups (functional sets): surface, structural, enzymatic, unknown (unclassified genes), and other (hypothetical genes). Specifically, for each virus in the database, we divided its genome into the five gene sets defined above. Each gene set contains all the virus genes of the same functional group. For example, the surface gene set of a virus contains all the genes that encode surface proteins in the virus’s genome. A set might be empty for a particular virus if no genes of the corresponding functional group exist in that virus. See Supplementary document, Table S2 for a list of the total number of sets and genes of each functional group in the database. The analysis of under-represented sequences was then performed separately in each of the five gene sets for each of the viruses in the database (see more details in Supplementary document, Section 1.6). A complete list of all under-represented sequences in each viral functional group over all viruses in the database is available in Supplementary Table S8.We first analysed the average number of under-represented sequences identified in each gene set. To control for the difference in the average gene size and the number of genes in each set, we randomly selected 1,500, 1,240, 1,450, 3,300, and 2,210 genes from each of the surface, structural, enzymatic, unknown, and hypothetical functional groups, respectively. This means that the number of identified under-represented sequences is analysed over similar region sizes, and the differences between the different sets cannot be explained by the genes’ nucleotide size in each set.Figure 8A depicts the average number of under-represented sequences (over all three reading frames) identified in each of the gene set over the (randomly selected) subset of genes. Relatively small number of under-represented sequences were identified in surface genes (that participate in the recognition of the host receptors), when compared with the other gene sets. At least twice as many were identified in many of the enzymatic genes. These proteins interact closely with the host cell machinery, are essential for the viral replication cycle, and thus must use mechanisms that guarantee their function.

These differ between the different functional groups; however, homooligonucleotide sequences appear among the most abundant common under-represented sequences in all groups.We designed an attenuated ZIKV variant based on the under-represented analysis we performed. Such variants may be useful in the future for generating a live-attenuated vaccine.Specifically, we introduced synonymous mutations to the NS5 nucleotide sequence, which includes under-represented sequences, and named the new variant UR99 (see details in Section 2).Infection studies in Vero cells demonstrated fractional variant attenuation of the UR99 virus, which was correlative with our model predictions (see foci size in Fig. 9A, right bottom). In addition, infectious virus collected and evaluated from the UR99 variant showed substantial attenuation relative to WT ZIKV (Fig. 9A). Incorporation of under-represented sequences produced an attenuated ZIKV variant. (A) Foci size and replication kinetics of WT ZIKV and UR99 in Vero cells.

(D) PRNT50 titres from serum collected from vaccinated AG129 mice 13 days post vaccination (****P < 0.0001 and **P < 0.01 when compared with vehicle treatment).There is evidence that AG129 mice lacking IFN-a/ß and IFN-<U+03B3> (types I and II interferon) receptors can be valuable for evaluating the efficacy of new vaccines and anti-viral treatments for ZIKV.49,50 Therefore, as these mice are immune compromised, various strains of ZIKV cause lethal infection and disease, and will typically cause morbidity and mortality. Depending on the strain, severe disease is observed between 1 and 2 weeks after virus challenge.50,51Thus, to further test the synthetic vaccine attenuation level in vivo, AG129 mice were challenged with attenuated ZIKV preparations as well as synthetic WT ZIKV. These inoculations were done in parallel with the original virus grown in cell culture. Infection with the synthetically attenuated ZIKV strains was lethal in all inoculated AG129 mice. However, the mortality curve of mice infected with UR99 was delayed, when compared with that of WT Malaysia and WT synthetic ZIKV (average of 20.4 days in UR99 vs. 15 and 17.5 in WT Malaysia/synthetic ZIKV, respectively; see Fig. 9B). No mortality was observed in unvaccinated controls, and mice vaccinated with vehicle (Fig. 9B).Weight loss was also observed in all the infected mice (30–40%; see Fig. 9C). Normal control mice experienced general weight gain throughout the experimental period (Fig. 9C). Weight loss corresponded well with mortality, and mice typically lost substantial weight, requiring humane euthanasia.neutAb is the primary mediator of protection in vaccine studies in this model.52,53 Therefore, serum samples were taken to determine the presence of neutAb in infected mice. The neutAb titre was evaluated in vaccinated mice 2 weeks after vaccination. Mice vaccinated with synthetic WT or UR99 had significantly (P < 0.0001) elevated neutAb titres when compared with vehicle controls (see Fig. 9D). As expected, no neutAb was detected in mice vaccinated with vehicle or in normal control groups (see Fig. 9D).The virulence levels of UR99 were somewhat lower than the levels of the Malaysian and Synthetic WT strains, thus demonstrating that under-represented sequences can be potentially used in the design of live attenuated ZIKV strains. Accordingly, additional attenuation of this variant (e.g. by introducing similar changes to other ZIKV proteins) may further decreases the lethality of the mice infected by it. Since AG129 mice are very susceptible to ZIKV infection,49–51 this mouse model might be too stringent to test these live attenuated vaccine candidates, as human infection is generally sub-clinical after natural ZIKV infection, hence the attenuated strain might be effective in an immunocompetent model.We compared the average number of under-represented sequences identified in each pair of a virus and its corresponding host. See Supplementary document, Section 2.10 for more details. We found that in ~75% of the cases the average number was larger in the hosts. We believe that this is due to the fact that the viral genome is usually populated with many overlapping codes and genes, when compared with cellular organisms.54–56 This introduces many constraints along the viral genome, which can decrease the number of under-represented sequences in the virus. For example, a sub-optimal codon within the host coding region may be synonymously replaced by evolution without affecting the host fitness. However, due to overlapping codes, replacing a sub-optimal codon within the viral coding region may affect multiple proteins and genes, and thus be deleterious to the virus.3.2 DiscussionIn this study, we analyse sequences of three, four, and five nucleotides long that are under-represented in the coding regions of viruses of all types and in their corresponding host coding regions. This study is based on a novel statistical evaluation that controls for classical coding region features, which is performed separately in each of the three reading frames. We provide various novel discoveries that may shed light on the evolution of viral DNA sequences and on the virus co-evolution with its respective hosts. It is important to emphasize that the observed patterns may be related to various variables and their complex interactions, include gene expression optimizations, various mechanisms for escaping the host immune system, and co-evolution with the corresponding hosts. For example, it was reported that suppression of CG dinucleotides in HIV-1 is due to co-evolution with its vertebrate host to avoid the host defence mechanisms.18In general, our analysis reveals that under-represented viral sequences are related to different mechanisms such as restriction modification systems and possibly to alternative or unknown immune escape mechanisms, as these sequences cannot be explained by canonical mechanisms that may suggest, for example, classical viral recognition using antibodies.We show that homooligonucleotide repeats are the most abundant under-represented sequences in both viruses and hosts. A possible explanation for this avoidance is to reduce an erroneous ribosomal frame shifts and thus reduce faulty translation and consequentially the overall translation cost. However, as this motif is shown to be shared between hosts and viruses, our analysis also indicates that a stronger selection pressure against these sequences exists in viruses. This again can be attributed to escape mechanisms from the host immune system, as the virus nucleotide composition evolves to be similar to the host, and it is certainly possible that an excess avoidance of homooligonucleotide repeats reduces viral recognition by classical host immune mechanisms. There may be other relevant explanations such as interaction with small RNA genes (e.g. miRNAs). It is possible, for example, that these sequences may increase the efficiency of miRNA and mRNA interactions and thus decrease expression levels. This should be studied further.In addition to homooligonucleotide repeats, we show that palindromes are among the most abundant under-represented sequences in viruses. Specifically, excluding homooligonucleotide repeats, our analysis reveals that 51% of all under-represented sequences of four nucleotides long in viruses are palindromes (where only 6.25% of all possible sequences of that size are palindromes).Indeed, analysis of palindromes avoidance in viruses was performed previously. It was shown that palindromes are the most under-represented short sequences in a prokaryotic genome.25–27 For example, it was reported that short palindromic sequences are avoided at a statistically significant level in the genomes of several bacteria.25 Four and six nucleotides palindromic sequences that are avoided were reported for few viruses and hosts in,57 and avoidance of palindromes in several dozen phage genomes was reported in26 These analyses are based on statistical counts of certain sequences in the given DNA and thus do not control for canonical coding region features (codon usage bias, amino acid order and content and dinucleotide distribution) as was done in this study. In addition, our analysis is performed over a larger set of viruses of all types and their corresponding hosts, and at a reading frame resolution. Thus, we believe that the results reported here may be more accurate, and should provide a better understanding of this phenomenon.One plausible explanation for avoidance of palindromes in viruses is because they are targets for many restriction-modification systems and possibly for general recombination systems as well. We statistically show a high overlap between under-represented palindromes in viruses and restriction enzyme patterns. This overlap cannot be explained by classical coding region features. Restriction of recognition sites has been observed in genomes of prokaryotic organisms.26,28–30,46 The authors in29 analysed the avoidance of restriction sites in few bacteriophage, and concentrated on sites containing six nucleotides. Rusinov et al.46 studied most known recognition sites (both palindromic and asymmetric) in thousands of prokaryotic genomes and found factors that influence their avoidance. It was also shown that the recognition site avoidance correlates with the lifespan of restriction-and-modification systems. Recently, the authors in31 analysed avoidance of recognition sites of restriction-modification systems in the genomes of prokaryotic viruses and found it to be a widespread but not a universal anti-restriction strategy of these viruses. The method used by the authors is based on a compositional bias calculation, which is the ratio of the observed to the expected frequency of a sequence, where the expected frequency is estimated based on the observed frequencies of all sub-sites of a given sequence. The compositional bias measure was originally used in32 for analysing over- and under-represented sequences in DNA viruses. Since the compositional bias measure doesn’t account for a statistical background that preserves know evolutionary forces, we believe that a more accurate and comprehensive procedure of identifying under-represented sequences is the one used here.In addition, we analyse the distribution of these under-represented sequences among various viral and host groups. We show, for example, that dsDNA viruses infecting bacteria or vertebrate hosts contain a larger set of under-represented sequences than other viral types and that this may be related to their larger genome size. Furthermore, we show that on average the set of sequences that are under-represented in viruses but are not under-represented in their related hosts is the largest set among different host–virus under-represented correspondence.We also show that the selection against under-represented sequences in viruses depends upon the protein function. For example, larger number of sequences is shown to be under-represented in enzyme genes than in surface genes. Moreover, even larger number of sequences is found to be under-represented in genes with (currently) unknown functionality, prompting further investigation into the nature of these genes. The differences between these groups may also be related to the expression levels of the different proteins. If, for example, surface genes tend to have low expression levels then they may be under weaker selection for features such as under-represented sequences.Vaccines are a topic of a singular importance in present day biomedical science. However, the discovery of vaccines has so far been primarily empirical in nature requiring considerable investments of time, efforts, and resources.58 To overcome the numerous pitfalls attributed to the classical vaccine design strategies, more efficient and robust rational approaches are highly desirable. One direction in designing in silico vaccine candidates may be based on exploiting the synonymous information, encoded in the viral genomes and related to gene expression, for attenuating the viral replication cycle while retaining its genotype and structure. The analysis and results reported here may have important implications in vaccine synthesis. Specifically, the outcomes of this study may provide clues and guidance into practical design of efficient and safe viral vaccines via attenuated viral material. Furthermore, it may also prove to be beneficial for other biotechnological objectives related to viral based products such as developing oncolytic viruses and engineering phages to fight bacteria.59–64 Indeed, we demonstrate, both in vitro and in vivo, how under-represented sequences can be utilized to obtain an attenuated ZIKV.The aim of these experiments is an initial proof of concept. Of course, additional experiments with more variants and controls are needed to better understand the effect of these under-represented sequences on the viral growth rate and fitness. For example, it will be helpful to study additional mutants that do not possess under-represented sequences but include other types of mutation. However, it is important to emphasize an interesting and a non-obvious aspect of these experiments. The introduced mutations are silent and thus did not alter the encoded protein. Based on our experience, in many cases silent mutations may not affect the viral fitness, and furthermore, there are cases where they may even improve its growth rate. Also, it is important to emphasize that in these experiments both the wild-type and the mutant variants were generated by the same process and from the same infectious-clone plasmid.Finally, the randomization models used in this study may not completely preserve the viral RNA secondary structure, and thus the selection for under-represented sequences may be partially due to alterations in secondary structures.We are grateful to the anonymous referees for comments that greatly helped in improving this paper.

IntroductionTobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) has great social and economic impacts on public health worldwide.1 One way to mitigate the impacts is to improve the tobacco quality, including both agronomic and quality traits, such as reduction of alkaloid level.2 Previous studies have revealed that most agronomic and quality traits are primarily influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, as well as developmental processes.3 However, molecular networks by which genetic and environmental factors influence these traits remain elusive.One strategy to probe the molecular network(s) is a systematical characterization of molecular compositions (i.e. gene, protein, and metabolite) under genetic, environmental, and developmental perturbations. With the advent of high-throughput omics technologies, we are now capable of identifying and quantifying transcriptome, proteome, and metabolome by next-generation sequencing and high-resolution mass spectrometer (MS). In tobacco, whole-genome and RNA sequencing identified ~90,000 genes and over 134,000 transcripts.4–6 Recently, several research groups analysed tobacco transcriptome to understand transcriptional regulation involved in various agronomic and quality traits, such as response to premature senescence7 and response to topping.8Tobacco is also a secondary metabolite-rich crop, with more than 4,000 different metabolites in its leaves.9,10 Many agronomic traits have been associated with metabolites in plant.9,11,12 Recently, researchers used both targeted and untargeted metabolomics technologies to characterize metabolic responses to environmental factors and developmental processes in tobacco.13,14 Although these studies provided a list of altered metabolites under perturbations, little is known about the underlying molecular networks and interaction between metabolites with genes underlying agronomic and quality traits in tobacco.While analysis of a single omics data (e.g. transcriptome or metabolome) provides biological understanding at a specific molecular layer, many agronomic and quality traits involve complex crosstalk between different molecular layers, such as genome, proteome, and metabolome. An integrative analysis of multiple layers of molecular data helps to discover and elucidate underlying molecular mechanisms of complex traits. For example, we recently integrated transcriptomics and metabolomics data to identify molecular networks in response to cold stress in tobacco.15Several statistical algorithms have been proposed to tackle multi-omics data, including unsupervised, and supervised data integration methods.16 Unsupervised data integration refers to the cluster of methods that draw an inference from input datasets without labelled response variables. The two most widely used approaches are partial least squares (PLS) 17 and canonical correlation analysis (CCA).18 However, the CCA method is a linear technique in which each component is constructed based on a linear combination of variables. Although PLS assumes a non-linear relationship between different sets of data, the interpretation of the results is not straightforward. Compared with the unsupervised data integration methods, the supervised methods consider sample information (e.g. disease or normal), and then performs data integration with sophisticated statistical or machine learning methods. Representative methods include network-based, multi-kernel and multi-step-based methods. However, the main limitation of the supervised methods is that the learning process heavily depends on the quality of the training omics datasets.In this study, we profile both transcriptome and metabolome from 54 tobacco samples collected from six developmental stages of three widely planted varieties (K326, Hongda, and Zhongyan100) planted in three most tobacco productive regions (Henan, Guizhou, and Yunnan) in China. We identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) and metabolites (DEMs), and construct co-expression modules for both DEGs and DEMs, and validate them by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR). We further define gene regulatory networks (GRNs) for co-expression gene modules. We also propose a novel approach to integrate transcript and metabolite co-expression modules to identify joint gene-metabolite relations. Finally, we integrate DE and network results to identify a novel gene, LOC107773232, as a potential regulator in the carotenoid metabolism pathway.2. Materials and methods2.1. Tobacco samplesA total of 54 tobacco samples were used, including three varieties (Hongda, k326, and Zhongyan100) planted in three locations (Guizhou, Henan, and Yunnan) in China across six developmental stages, each with 2–3 biological replicates (n = 151). The six developmental stages include vigorous growth (S1), budding (S2), fully blooming (S3), maturity of lower leaves (S4), pre-maturity of middle leaves (S5), and maturity of middle leaves (S6). The six developmental stages were determined by morphologic features of the tobacco. Vigorous growth (S1) is an important stage at which tobacco grows rapidly, typically during the period of ~30–60 days after transplanting. We collected samples at 50 days after transplanting. Budding (S2) is a stage of ~50% plants with buds. Fully blooming (S3) is a stage of >50% plants in blossom. The maturity of lower leaves (S4) is a stage at the beginning of lower leaves turning yellow. The pre-maturity of middle leaves (S5) is at the stage of 10 days after S4. The maturity of middle leaves (S6) is the time that parts of middle leaves turn yellow.2.2. RNA isolation, microarray analysis, and qRT-PCRThe total RNA of each sample was extracted from fresh leaves using the Qiagen RNAeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen) on leaves of three independent plants. The RNA quality was verified using a Bioanalyzer (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA), and samples with an RNA integrity number (RIN) value above 7.5 were selected. A total of 5.5 µg of the ampli<U+FB01>ed products were used.The labelled cDNAs 5.2 µg were dissolved in 160 µl of hybridization mix solution and then denatured at 99°C for 5 min. The mixed hybridization buffer was loaded into a microarray, and performed in a hybridization oven (Affymetrix) at 45°C for 16 h. The array is a customized chip, including 81,251 probe sets, corresponding to 77,924 probe sets.For qRT-PCR, total RNAs were extracted from tobacco samples from three locations and six development stages using a EASYspin plus plant RNA isolation kit (Aidlab, China). After evaluation of RNA concentration by a Nanodrop 2000 instrument (Thermo), cDNA synthesis was performed with 1 µg RNA of each sample per 20 µl reaction using a Transcriptor First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Roche), according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Quantitative PCR reactions were prepared in triplicate using 2 µl of 10 times diluted cDNA, 0.5 µl of each primer in 10 mM, and 10 µl of 2×SYBR master buffer (Roche) in a reaction volume of 20 µl. The qPCR reactions were performed on a LightCycler® 96 machine (Roche) using the following program: (i) 95°C for 10 min, (ii) 95°C for 10 s, (iii) 50–60°C for 15 s depending on primer Tm, (iv) 72°C for 15 s for fluorescence measurement, (v) go to step (ii) and repeat 40 cycles, (vi) additional final cycle at 95°C for 5 s, 65°C for 1 min, and 97°C for 1 s at a continuous fluorescence acquisition mode to analyse the specific amplification of targets, and (vii) 40°C for 10 s. Relative transcription level of each target gene was calculated using a 2-<U+0394>Ct formula, in which <U+0394>Ct was the difference between Ct values of target gene to reference gene. Tobacco EF1a gene was used as reference. All primers used for RT-qPCR analyses are listed in Supplementary Table S9.2.3. Untargeted metabolomics using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry , and capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometryWe performed untargeted metabolome profiling using three platforms: gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS), liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS), and capillary electrophoresis-mass spectrometry (CE-MS). For the GC-MS, the freeze-dried tissues were ground into powder, and 20 mg was extracted in 1.5 ml solution of isopropanol/acetonitrile/water (3/3/2, v/v/v) with 15 µl (2 mg/ml) tridecanoic acid as an internal standard. After 1 h extraction with sonication, 500 µl of supernatant was collected by 10 min centrifugation (150,00 rpm). The supernatant was dried in a vacuum condenser prior to derivatization with pyridine solution of methoxamine hydrochloride (37°C, 90 min), and MSTFA (60°C, 60 min). The metabolomic analysis was performed on an Agilent 5975C according to a pseudotargeted method.19 Briefly, the Agilent DB-5MS column (0.25 µm, 0.25 mm × 30 m) was used, and the injection volume was 1 µl with a 10:1 split ratio. The detector voltage was maintained at 1.2 kV, and the electron impact model was selected to achieve ionization of the metabolites at 70 eV.For the LC-Q-TOF/MS, 20 mg of lyophilized tobacco leaf powder was extracted with 1.5 ml of the extraction solution [5 µg/ml umbelliferone (internal standard) in methanol/water (3:1, v/v)]. After 1 h ultrasonication, insoluble material was removed by centrifugation at 12,000×g for 10 min, and a total of 800 µl of the supernatant was transferred to a glass vial prior to injection into the instrument. The LC-MS analysis was performed on an Agilent 1290 Series UHPLC system coupled to an Agilent 6540 TOF/MS instrument with a Dual AJS ESI source. Chromatographic separation was achieved using an Agilent Zorbax SB-C18 (RRHD, 2.1 mm × 100 mm, 1.8 µm particle) analytical column operated at 60°C. Mass spectrometric analysis was performed in positive mode with full scan mode from 50 to 1,000 m/z.For the CE-MS, fresh samples were used and analysed by an Agilent G7100A CE system coupled to a G6224A TOF/MS according to the method described previously.132.4. Analysis of DE genes and metabolitesFor each gene or metabolite, the P-value was calculated using the ANOVA method, and multiple corrections were performed using the Benjamini and Hochberg (BH) method.20 We applied an adjusted P-value of 0.01 as a threshold to define DEGs or metabolites.2.5. Principal component analysis and hierarchical clusteringPrincipal component analysis (PCA) was used to visualize the differences among samples. All gene and metabolite abundance were used as features of PCA. The pairwise Euclidean distance between features was calculated. PCA was performed using the R package prcomp (version 3.4.0).21The hierarchical clustering of DE genes and metabolites was performed to determine the differences among diverse groups. Hierarchical clustering was carried out using the heatmap.2 function in R statistical analysis package. The clustering for heatmap.2 was obtained with Ward’s linkage and Euclidean distance. Disease groups were clustered and visualized with heat map based on the scaled expression values.2.6. Pathway enrichment by gene ontology, KEGG, and hallmark databasesPathway enrichment analysis was carried out to infer functional groups of genes and metabolites that were enriched in a given dataset. The analysis was performed using Fisher’s exact test22 with the BH correction for multiple testing (FDR). Enriched pathways with FDR < 5% were considered statistically significant.For gene functional enrichment, we used gene ontology (GO) database downloaded from the plantGSEA databases (http://structuralbiology.cau.edu.cn/PlantGSEA). For metabolite enrichment analysis, we used 118 curated pathways, including amino acid metabolism, carbohydrate metabolism, carotenoid metabolism, chlorophyll metabolism, glycolysis/glucolysis, lipid metabolism, nicotine metabolism, phenylpropanoids, and flavonoid metabolism, polyamine biosynthesis, sterol metabolism, and tricarboxylic acid cycle (Supplementary Table S8).2.7. Genome-wide co-expression analysis for DEGs and DEMsWe constructed weighted gene co-expression networks based on DEGs and metabolites using the WGCNA package in R. The product was a weighted adjacency matrix that provided continuous connection strength ([0, 1]) based on the ß parameter for each condition to meet the scale-free topology criterion. The concept of the scale-free network has emerged as a powerful paradigm in the study of network biology. Most biological networks, such as metabolic, protein, and gene interaction networks, have been reported to exhibit scale-free behaviour based on the analysis of the distribution of the number of connections of the network nodes.23 A scale-free network is one whose majority nodes has only a few connections to other nodes, whereas some nodes (hubs) are connected to many other nodes in the network. The number of connections each node has is called its degree. If we represent the degree distribution of a scale-free network in a logarithmic scale, we can see how it fits with a line (they fit a power-law), having a small number of nodes with high degree (the hubs), and a large number of nodes with a low degree. Subsequently, the co-expression matrix and the topological overlap matrix (TOM) were constructed. For TOM, we assessed the interconnectedness of two genes by the degree of their shared neighbours across the global network. We detected the gene modules by average linkage hierarchical clustering for each group. The intra-modular connectivity of each gene was also computed using the intra-modular connectivity function in R. The module eigengene (ME) is the first principal component of a given module, and it was used to evaluate the module membership, which assesses the importance of genes in the network. We used the ß power parameter of 7 for both gene and metabolite co-expression analyses.2.8. Regulatory network prediction using ARACNe-APTranscriptional regulatory networks were predicted for each co-expression modules using ARACNe-AP.24 For each module, the input to ARACNe-AP consisted of a matrix containing the gene expression data of each co-expression module and a list of genes in the pathway. We used 422 genes from eight curated pathways (Supplementary Table S8), including aspartate oxidase (AO), NtADC, and ornithine decarboxylase (ODC). A P-value of 1.0 × 10-8 was used as a threshold for mutual information. Predicted networks were visualized in Cytoscape25 within ARACNe.262.9. Integration of transcriptomic and metabolomic data using two-way correlationTo integrate transcriptomic and metabolomics data, we performed two-way Pearson correlations: (i) between each metabolite and the eigenvector from nine co-expression gene modules; (ii) between each gene and the eigenvector from four co-expression metabolite modules. A P-value < 0.01 was used to identify statistically significant correlation.2.10. Ranking genes with Fisher’s combined probability testTo rank genes by its functional importance, we calculated a combined score using Fisher’s combined probability test.27 For each gene, we first computed five individual P-values as follows:P-value of the correlation between the expression of each gene and its associated co-expression module. We use the module membership (kME) for each co-expression module, which was generated by the WGCNA program;P-value of differential gene expression between three locations;P-value of differential gene expression between three varieties;P-value of differential gene expression between six developmental stages;P-value of the correlation between the expression of each gene and the best-correlated metabolite module (i.e. kME).3. Results3.1. Global transcriptome and metabolome profiling of tobacco leavesTo explore the effects of genetic and environmental factors as well as developmental processes on agronomic and quality traits, we collected 54 tobacco leaf samples (Supplementary Table S1), composed of six developmental stages of three varieties planted in three regions in China. The three regions, Yunnan, Guizhou, and Henan, are the most tobacco productive areas in China (Fig. 1A). Yunnan is located in southwest China, has the highest sun exposure time during the vigorous growth period, and less temperature and rainfall (Supplementary Fig. S1). Guizhou lies in the northeast of Yunnan, a subtropical plateau with median temperature and abundant rainfall, but less sun exposure time compared with Yunnan and Henan (Supplementary Fig. S1). Henan is located in the central plain of China where the temperature is considerably high and has mediate sun exposure time and rainfall (Supplementary Fig. S1). The three regions represent three different flavour styles of the flue-cured tobacco: light, strong, and intermediate flavours. The three varieties, K326, Hongda, and Zhongyan100, are accompanied by substantially differ in agronomic, quality, and physiological traits. For example, K326 has higher alkaloids than Zhongyan 100 and Hongda.28,29 The six major developmental stages include vigorous growth (S1), budding (S2), full-bloom (S3), maturity of lower leaves (S4), pre-maturity of middle leaves (S5), and maturity of middle leaves (S6) (Fig. 1B). In this study, we performed four-phase analyses (Fig. 1C): (i) profiling transcriptomic and metabolomic data from the 54 leaf samples; (ii) detecting differentially expressed transcripts and metabolites under genetic (i.e. three varieties) and environmental perturbations (i.e. three regions), and six developmental stages; (iii) identifying genome-wide co-expression gene and metabolite modules and constructing regulatory networks for co-expression gene modules; and (iv) integrating transcript and metabolite co-expression modules to identify joint gene–metabolite relations and potential candidate regulators.Experimental design and data analysis in this study.

A total of 81,251 probe sets were used to measure the expression of transcripts (Fig. 2A). We annotated these probe sets by mapping the sequences to the genome of K326, a tobacco reference genome.4 A total of 77,924 probe sets can be mapped to the tobacco genome, and are used for the subsequent analysis. PCA showed an apparent clustering of three locations by PC2 (Fig. 2B), and good separation of developmental stages by PC1 (Supplementary Fig. S2), indicating a high quality of the RNA samples.Profiling of transcriptome and metabolome of 54 tobacco samples.

(D) PCA plots of the samples using metabolomic data.We also profiled metabolome of leaves using three mass spectrometry platforms, including GC-MS, LC-MS, and CE-MS. Leaves were freeze-dried for GC-MS and LC-MS and fresh for CE-MS. We identified and quantified a total of 2,075 unique features and annotated 759 metabolites. After the removal of the duplicates, 561 metabolites with unique structure annotations were used for the subsequent analysis (Supplementary Table S2). The 515 metabolites include 219 metabolites detected by GC-MS, 158 metabolites by LC-MS, and 138 by CE-MS, respectively (Fig. 2C). As expected, polar metabolites (e.g. amino acids, sugar, and nucleic acids) were detected by GC-MS and CE-MS, whereas second-metabolism compounds (e.g. flavonoids and terpenes) were identified by LC-MS. Only 51 out of 561 metabolites were detected by two or three platforms, indicating three platforms complement one another in metabolomic profiling. Similar to transcriptomic analysis, PCA showed a separation for locations and developmental stages by the first two principal components (Fig. 2D).3.2. Differentially expressed gene analysisTo identify genes influenced by genetic and environmental perturbations, and developmental processes, we performed differential expression analysis for both transcriptomic data (Fig. 3A). First, we removed low-expressed transcripts by decomposing all transcripts with high and low expression using the expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm, retaining 43,675 out of 77,924 transcripts for subsequent analyses (Fig. 3B). By using ANOVA and multiple test correction, we detected 2,764 DEGs between three varieties, 24,705 DEGs between three locations, and 21,584 DEGs among six stages at adjusted P-value <0.01. To detect genes with relatively large variation, we applied at least two S.D.30 of fold change to each DEG. We finally identified 3,405 DEGs, including 941 DEGs between three varieties, 2,838 DEGs between six growth stages, and 2,763 DEGs between locations (Supplementary Table S3A and Fig. 3C). The vast majority (2,402/3,388; 70.54%) of DEGs is shared between locations and developmental stages, suggesting that a potential common molecular mechanism is involved in response to environmental perturbation and developmental processes (Supplementary Fig. S3A).Analyses of differentially expressed genes and metabolites.

The same data transformation and colour scheme are used as panel E. Color figures are available at DNARES online.As many DEGs are novel, we next assessed changes in mRNA expression of 20 selected genes between three locations and six developmental stages using qRT-PCR. Of the 20 selected DEGs, 18/20 (90%) were validated as DEGs between the three locations (Supplementary Fig. S4A), and 16/20 (80%) showed the same trend as measured by the Microarray (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Thus, the results largely support the reproducibility of DE genes from the microarray analysis. For example, both Microarray and qPCR validated that a chlorophyll a–b binding gene, CAB16, showed a marked decrease in Henan compared with Yunnan and Guizhou (Supplementary Fig. S4C), and a decrease in expression along the six developmental stages (Supplementary Fig. S4D). The result is consistent with the fact that CAB16 serves as the major pigment binding protein in functional photosystem II reflecting the degradation of chloroplast along the developmental stages and the climatic factors as Guizhou typically receives more rainfall slowing the leaf senescence.3.3. Functional enrichment analysis of DEGs and DEMsTo further understand the biological function of DEGs in response to genetic and environmental perturbations as well as developmental processes, we performed GO enrichment analysis using Fisher’s exact test with BH multiple testing correction. To do this, we further divided the DEGs into different categories with respect to their expression patterns, resulting in five clusters of expression pattern in the three varieties, four clusters in the three locations, and two clusters in six developmental stages, respectively (Fig. 3C). The functional enrichment analysis for each cluster identified 13 significant enrichments in several GO terms and pathways (Supplementary Table S6). For those DEGs of the three varieties, only cluster 3 was shown to be significantly enriched in photosynthesis (GO: 0009765; adjusted P-value of 0.03). In contrast, all four clusters of locational DEGs exhibited a significant enrichment. The cluster 1 also showed significant enrichment in photosynthesis (GO: 0019684; adjusted P-value of 2.00 × 10-2), indicating that a subset of genes is shared a similar molecular process in photosynthesis between variety and location. Both clusters 2 and 3 share two same significant enrichments: (i) response to stimuli, including light intensity (GO: 0009642; adjusted P-value of 5.36 × 10-3), oxidative stress (GO : 0006979; adjusted P-value of 3.40 × 10-2), and temperature (GO : 0009266; adjusted P-value of 4.68 × 10-3); (ii) cellular metabolic process (GO : 0044260; adjusted P-value of 3.80 × 10-2). The cluster 4 displays enrichment in immune system process (GO : 0002252; adjusted P-value of 3.80 × 10-2), regulation of biological process (GO : 0043069; adjusted P-value of 2.54 × 10-2), and response to stress (GO : 0002679; adjusted P-value of 1.32 × 10-2). For DEGs between six developmental stages, we found that cluster 1 shows enrichments in developmental process (GO : 0048731; adjusted P-value of 2.39 × 10-2), and metabolic process (GO : 0009820; adjusted P-value of 3.36 × 10-9), whereas the cluster 2 enriched in response to stimulus (GO : 0009605; adjusted P-value of 8.28 × 10-3), and regulation of biological process (GO : 0043069; adjusted P-value of 6.93 × 10-3).Similarly, we identified 361 DEMs with adjusted P-value < 0.01 (Supplementary Table S3B), including 192 DEMs between three varieties, 291 DEMs between three locations, and 297 DEMs between six developmental stages (Fig. 3D). The vast majority of the DEMs (134/371; 36.12%) showed changes in all three comparisons (Supplementary Fig. S2B). Functional enrichment analysis for DEMs using Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis in the MetaboAnalyst tool showed only three significant enrichments in the cluster 3 of DEMs from the developmental stage, including glycine and serine metabolism (adjusted P-value of 0.01), methionine metabolism (adjusted P-value of 0.02), and aspartate metabolism (adjusted P-value of 0.04).We next projected abundance changes at both transcript and metabolite levels to the two most important pathways involved in tobacco quality traits: nicotine synthesis pathway and carotenoid synthesis pathway (Fig. 3E and F). Nicotine is a secondary alkaloid synthesized primarily in roots but accumulated in leaves. Nicotine synthesis is through a pathway of the pyridine and pyrrolidine rings in which several key genes and metabolites are involved, referred to as the nicotine synthesis pathway.31 The pyrrolidine ring pathway starts with putrescine, which can be formed directly from l-ornithine by ODC and/or synthesized indirectly from arginine by arginine decarboxylase (ADC). Putrescine is converted to N-methylputrescine by putrescine N-methyltransferase. N-methylputrescine is then oxidized by N-methylputrescine oxidase, and cyclized to form the pyrrolidine ring. On the other hand, the pyridine ring pathway is composed of several genes, including AO, quinolinic acid synthase, and quinolinic acid phosphoribosyl transferase.4,6While most alkaloids are thought to be synthesized in roots and accumulated in leaves, most metabolites in the nicotine synthesis pathway in leaves showed up-regulation during the development stages (Fig. 3E). Nicotine and other five major tobacco alkaloids (i.e. anabasine, nicotyrine, cotinine, nornicotine, and myosmine) show relatively low at both transcript and metabolite abundance during the early stages and reach their maximum around the stages of 5 and 6. In general, genes show an earlier response than metabolites. For example, the level of gene AO raised for 4.35-fold from stage 1 to 2 and slightly decreased after the stage 2, whereas the level of metabolite nicotine in the pathway gradually increase for 2.73-fold from stage 1 to 6 (Supplementary Fig. S5A and B). Because gene expression is transient and we measured the expression in leaves instead of the roots, most genes response in early developmental stages. When comparing metabolite abundance between varieties, we found that alkaloids in Hongda showed a higher level than that in Zhongyan and K326. For three locations, the abundance of alkaloids in Henan is higher than that in Yunnan and Guizhou.We also examined abundance changes at transcript and metabolite levels in the carotenoid synthesis pathway. Carotenoids are the most common group of pigments observed in plant, playing essential roles in development, photosynthesis, and membrane stability. The pathway starts with a head-to-head coupling of two molecules of geranylgeranylpyrophosphate (GGPP) to yield colourless phytoene by phytoene synthase,30 with prephytoene diphosphate as an intermediate. Subsequently, four additional double bonds are introduced by desaturases producing the coloured carotenes phytofluene, carotene, neurosporene, and lycopene. Lycopene is cyclized twice by two individual cyclases, yielding a- and ß-carotene, which are subsequently processed to different xanthophylls, such as lutein, violaxanthin, and zeaxanthin. We found that genes and metabolites showed significant decrease along the developmental stages (Fig. 3F). For example, the level of gene CYP97A3 and metabolite beta-carotene dropped for 1.55-fold and 2.88-fold from stages 1 to 6, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S5C and D). This observation suggests that the photosynthetic capacity decreased, and chlorophylls started degradation when leaves became mature. Among three varieties, Hongda showed the highest abundance level compared with the other two varieties (i.e. K326 and Zhongyan100). By comparing three locations, Henan exhibited the lowest level of gene and metabolite abundance, whereas Yunnan showed the highest level (Supplementary Fig. S5C).3.4. Construction of co-expression gene and metabolite modulesTo further gain insights into the expression and functional organization of the transcriptome and metabolome, we constructed gene and metabolite co-expression modules for 3,405 DEGs and 371 DEMs, respectively (Supplementary Tables S4A and B) using WGCNA program. We identified a total of nine gene modules (Supplementary Table S5; Fig. 4A) with soft-thresholding power (ß  =  7) in accordance with the scale-free topology criterion (Fig. 4C). Supplementary Table S5; Fig. 4A The module size (i.e. the total number of genes in a module) varies significantly, ranging from 64 genes in the magenta module to 1,410 genes in the turquoise module (Supplementary Table S5). To investigate changes in expression pattern with respect to three varieties, three locations, and six developmental stages, we summarized the nine detected co-expression gene modules into three patterns in terms of up- or down-regulation. For example, the turquoise module shows up-regulation along the developmental stages, a higher level in expression in Hongda than K326 and Zhongyan100, and in Henan than Yunnan and Guizhou (Fig. 4E). We also examined whether any pre-defined pathways are enriched in each module. We found that genes involved in the carotenoid synthesis pathway are enriched in the blue module (P-value = 9.52 × 10-3); genes in the phenylpropanoids and flavonoid metabolism pathway are enriched in the brown module (P-value = 3.61 × 10-3); and genes in the chlorophyll metabolism (P-value = 1.3 × 10-2), nicotine metabolism (P-value = 4.33 × 10-2), and polyamine biosynthesis pathways (P-value = 4.33 × 10-2) are enriched in the turquoise module (Supplementary Table S4A).Co-expression analyses of transcriptomic and metabolomic data.

The module size ranges from 25 metabolites in the yellow module to 107 in the turquoise module (Supplementary Table S5). Only two expression patterns were observed, including up-regulation and down-regulation along development stages (Fig. 4F). Metabolite enrichment analysis shows that the blue module has over-representative metabolites in both carotenoid synthesis pathway (P-value = 3.16 × 10-2) and lipid metabolism pathway (P-value = 1.48 × 10-2); the brown module has enriched metabolites in amino acid metabolism pathway (P-value = 6.3 × 10-5); and turquoise module has over-representative metabolites in both carbohydrate metabolism pathway (P-values = 1.18 × 10-2) and nicotine synthesis pathway (P-values = 1.53 × 10-4) (Supplementary Table S4B).3.5. Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) in gene modulesWe next sought to derive de novo GRNs for co-expression gene modules using the ARACNe-AP tool,24 a widely used information-theoretical method for GRN reconstruction.26 ARACNe-AP computes expression correlations between genes and selects those statistically significant genes as edges in the GRNs.32 In contrast to traditional GRN construction using transcriptional factors, we used 422 genes in eight curated pathways (see Materials and methods) as regulators to identify their targets in co-expression modules. Using a stringent threshold for mutual information (P-value = 1.0 × 10-8), three co-expression modules (i.e. blue, brown, and turquoise) out of the nine co-expression modules (Fig. 5) were formed into GRNs, and we further examined biological functions of these genes.Transcriptional networks for three co-expression modules. The network was constructed with the ARACNe-AP program. Gene names in red are presented in both co-expression modules and the pathways (Supplementary Table S8). Nodes in blue are only detected in co-expression modules. The edge thickness is proportional to the correlation strength. The thicker the edge, the greater the correlation between the two genes. Color figures are available at DNARES online.Transcriptional networks for three co-expression modules. The network was constructed with the ARACNe-AP program. Gene names in red are presented in both co-expression modules and the pathways (Supplementary Table S8). Nodes in blue are only detected in co-expression modules. The edge thickness is proportional to the correlation strength. The thicker the edge, the greater the correlation between the two genes. Color figures are available at DNARES online.The first regulatory network is associated with the nicotine biosynthesis pathway detected in the turquoise co-expression module. Two key nicotine biosynthesis-related genes (i.e. ODC and ADC) were found to be associated with 23 genes in a GRN. A total of nine genes are directly associated with ODC, including two genes (PEN3 and DOX1), many of which are involved in defence against pathogens and herbivores, which is consistent with the function of nicotine as plant inducible defence. PEN3 encodes the putative ATP-binding cassette (ABC) transporter, playing central components in cell wall-based defence against microbial pathogens.33,DOX1 encodes alpha-dioxygenase that mediates protection against oxidative stress and cell death,34 and is negatively associated with abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated signalling pathway.35 ADC is associated with 19 genes, most of which are involved in defence and protection, including two transcriptional factors (DREB1A and WRKY33), EDR2, and BAP2. The transcription factor DREB1A induces expression of genes involved in environmental stress tolerance in Arabidopsis.36,37,WRKY33 is a positive regulator of the salt stress response and ABA signalling.38 Similarly, EDR2 is a negative regulator of salicylic acid-mediated resistance to pathogens.39,40BAP2 is a general inhibitor of programmed cell death. In addition, we also found that five genes are directly associated with both ODC and NtADC, four of which are less well annotated (LOC107789329, LOC4328997, LOC107799533, and LOC107789328), indicating that many potential genes regulating nicotine synthesis pathway are not yet fully appreciated in tobacco.The second regulatory network is the carotenoid synthesis pathway detected in the blue co-expression module. A carotenoid related gene, VDE, which encodes violaxanthin de-epoxidase, is found to be directly associated with 17 genes, including genes promoting growth and development (GA20OX1) and three genes associated with chloroplast and photosynthesis (CP12, CAB, and PSRP). GA20OX1 is a key enzyme in the synthesis of gibberellins, which promotes growth and development. Previous studies suggested that carotenoids and gibberellins are derived from the common precursor GGPP.41,42 The observations are consistent with the function of the carotenoid synthesis pathway in the regulation of plant growth and development.43,CP12 encodes a small peptide found in the chloroplast stroma and is coordinately regulated by light with the photosynthetic GAPDH and PRK.44,CAB is a gene that encodes the chlorophyll a/b-binding protein, which functions as a light receptor and captures and delivers excitation energy to photosystems.45 PSRP is a plastid-specific ribosomal protein, acting in light regulation of translation.46,473.6. Integrative analysis of gene and metabolite modulesWe further performed integrative analysis for identified gene and metabolite co-expression modules using two-way Pearson correlations (Fig. 6A). First, we correlated the abundance of metabolites with the eigenvector (ME) of each gene module to identify the metabolites associated with nine gene modules (Fig. 6B) (Supplementary Table S7A). We found that the ME of the blue gene module shows positively correlated most of the metabolites (n = 275), followed by the turquoise gene module (n = 196). In contrast, brown and black gene modules exhibit a negative correlation with metabolites. For example, metabolite nicotine significantly correlated with the ME of the module turquoise (R2 = 0.19; P-value = 1.95 × 10-8) (Fig. 6C). The result is reminiscent of our earlier observation that genes in the turquoise module show enrichment in the nicotine synthesis pathway.Integrative analysis of transcriptomic and metabolomic data.

The same colour scheme is used as panel B. (E) Scatter plot showing correlation between metabolite turquoise module and ABR1. Color figures are available at DNARES online.We also correlated transcripts with the ME of four metabolite modules: turquoise, blue, brown, and yellow (Fig. 6D). Three MMs (turquoise, blue, and brown) show a significant positive correlation (P-value < 0.01) with 2,631, 1,423, and 1,746 transcripts, respectively (Supplementary Table S7B). In contrast, the yellow module shows a negative correlation with 1,844 transcripts. For example, the top statistically significantly correlated gene with the metabolite turquoise module is ABR1 (R2 = 0.68, P-value = 1.28 × 10-38) (Fig. 6E). ABR1 is an AP2-domain transcription factor that functions as a repressor of ABA response.48 ABA is involved in plant growth and primary metabolisms under non-stress conditions, such as carbohydrate and carotenoid metabolisms, which were found to be enriched in the metablite module turquoise.3.7. Identifying potential functional genes by integrative analysisWe finally sought to identify novel functional genes in response to genetic and environmental perturbations by considering all results generated by our integrative analysis. To rank genes by its functional importance, we generated a combined score (Fig. 7A) using Fisher’s combined probability test.27 The combined score was computed based on five analyses, including the P values from DE analyses between three locations, between three varieties, and six developmental stages, the P-value of network connectivity, and the P-value of the gene correlated with the metabolite module. As expected, most of the top 50 ranked genes are involved in plant development, photosynthesis, and regulators of abiotic stress responses (Fig. 7B). LOC107773232 is ranked at the fourth position in the list, which cannot be captured by individual datasets (Supplementary Fig. S6): ranking as 1448th position in differentially expression analysis between three locations, 273rd position in differentially expression analysis between three varieties, 366th position in differentially expression analysis between six stages, 1062nd position in the network connectivity of gene co-expression analysis, and 168th position in the network connectivity of metabolite co-expression analysis. The gene is a not well-characterized gene whose sequences are homologous to chlorophyll a–b binding protein 40 (CAB40). qPCR confirmed that LOC107773232 shows an elevated expression in Guizhou compared with Yunnan and Henan (Fig. 7C) and a decrease in expression along six developmental stages (Fig. 7D). When correlated metabolites in the carotenoid metabolism pathway, the expression of LOC107773232 was found to be highly correlated with both chlorophyll b (P-value = 1.73 × 10-12; Fig. 7E) and carotene (P-value = 2.79 × 10-12; Fig. 7F). Therefore, we surmise that it may be an important regulator involved in the carotenoid metabolism pathway (Fig. 3F).Identifying functional genes by gene prioritization.

DiscussionIn this study, we performed systems-level analyses of both transcriptome and metabolome profiled from 54 tobacco samples collected from six developmental stages of three varieties planted in three locations. We identified 3,405 DEGs and 371 DEMs between the three conditions (varieties, locations, and developmental stages), and constructed co-expression modules for both DEGs and DEMs. We further integrated transcript and metabolite co-expression modules using a two-way Pearson correlation. The results provide insights into molecular networks underlying complex agronomic and quality traits in tobacco.Recently, several studies investigated changes in metabolite abundance in tobacco, and revealed that the most important perturbation in tobacco metabolome is the geographical location.13,14 Consistently, we identified 2,763 DEGs and 291 DEMs between three locations compared with only 941 DEGs and 192 DEMs between three varieties, suggesting that environmental perturbation is a critical factor for transcriptomics data. Those DEGs between locations were mainly enriched in the biological processes of photosynthesis and stress (Supplementary Table S6), which is consistent with the different climatic conditions among three locations: Guizhou, Yunnan, and Henan. For example, most genes enriched in the process of response to light intensity (GO: 0009642) are highly expressed in Guizhou but low in Yunnan, suggesting those genes are negatively regulated by the total sunshine time, but positively respond to total rainfall during the entire growing period (Supplementary Fig. S1). Most DEGs over-represented in the light reaction process (GO: 0019684) show up-regulation in Yunnan, indicating that they were negatively regulated by the temperature because the average daily temperature is typically lower in Yunnan compared with Henan. In summary, DEGs between locations are largely contributed by the climatic conditions. In addition, among 941 DEGs between three varieties, 65% genes shared with DEGs between locations, indicating that part of DEGs between varieties are also contributed by climatic conditions. However, the underlying regulatory mechanisms could be different for several observations because only genes in cluster 3 of DEGs between varieties (Fig. 3C) are significantly enriched in the light harvesting process of photosynthesis (GO: 0009765, Supplementary Table S6), in which genes show higher expression level in Hongda compared with that in Zhongyan. Taken together, the findings provide an opportunity to gain insights into molecular mechanisms underlying response to environmental perturbation in tobacco.Previous studies only characterized tobacco changes in metabolite or gene abundance under a certain condition, such as developmental stages,14,49,50 or different locations.13 In contrast, we conducted a comprehensive analysis by profiling both transcriptomic and metabolomic across three varieties, three locations, and six developmental stages. Therefore, our analysis not only determined changes in gene and metabolite abundance under a single condition but also characterized changes under the interaction between two conditions. For example, we detected 946 DEGs and 77 DEMs that are influenced by the interaction of variety and developmental stages (Supplementary Tables S3A and B). In addition, our analysis globally examined the alternation of both transcripts and metabolites in a pathway (Fig. 3E and F). Integrative analysis of omics data is still a major challenge in biological research. To address the challenge, mathematical and statistical models are often developed to identify joint systematic variation between transcriptomic and metabolomic data.51 In this study, we proposed a novel approach to integrate two omics data by two-way Pearson correlations after detecting co-expression modules: (i) correlating each metabolite with eigenvector of co-expression gene module; and (ii) correlating each gene with eigenvector co-expression metabolite modules. The advantage of our approach compared with other statistical methods is that genes or metabolites in co-expression modules are highly correlated and involved in similar biological functions. In addition, the approach is simple and easy to understand compared with other multi-variate methods, such as the orthogonal partial least squares (O2PLS) model. Despite effectiveness, the correlation analysis suffers from certain limitations. The Pearson correlation typically requires the normal distribution underlying the data. Hence, we should be cautious when using data that do not follow the normal distribution, such as genotypic data. Moreover, correlation cannot be taken to imply causation although there is a very strong association between two variables. Developing more sophisticated statistical approaches will be needed to infer the causality, such as structural equation modeling.Over the past decades, traditional genetics and breeding approaches using quantitative trait locus mapping and DNA marker-assisted breeding have been widely used to improve agronomic and quality traits.52–54 Although many loci controlling these traits have been identified,54 they provided little information on molecular networks linking genetic loci to specific traits. That is, how variant(s) at the DNA level are translated to a phenotype through genetic information flow. In contrast, in this study, we globally examined changes at both transcript and metabolite levels and constructed molecular networks to probe the potential molecular networks underlying a trait. The advantage of this systems-biology approach is that it allows us to analyse molecular interactions within a single omics layer and trans-omics layers.We identified DEGs and DEMs as well as their co-expression modules. Some of the modules can be potentially linked to nicotine synthesis and carotenoid synthesis pathways (Fig. 5). However, further experimental validation is still needed using additional platforms in addition to large-scale omics profiling. For example, DEGs can be validated by RT-PCR and DEMs can be validated by targeted metabolomics using standard compounds. If any important genetic variants within candidate DEGs are observed between different varieties, we could perform some functional assays using gene-editing technologies, such as CRISPR technology.In this study, although we integrate transcripts with metabolites, proteins are typically considered to be closer to metabolites and classical phenotypes than transcripts. Therefore, information at the protein level could provide intermediate information between transcripts and metabolites. In the near future, we will profile whole proteome data using high-resolution MS. In addition, we will only focus on enzymes that are directly interacted with metabolites in metabolic networks since only enzymes directly interact with metabolites. For network construction, we will use both data-driven and knowledge-based approaches to integrate multi-omics data. Moreover, single-cell RNA sequencing and single cell-type proteomics are also emerging. With these new technologies, we could potentially identify the major cell types involved in molecular networks in response to genetic and environmental perturbations, and developmental processes in tobacco.5. ConclusionIn conclusion, we performed an integrative analysis of both transcriptomic and metabolomic data and identified molecular networks that are involved in agronomic and quality traits in tobacco. This study underscores the importance of integrative analyses in elucidating regulatory networks underlying complex traits. The findings in this study could improve the tobacco quality traits by comprehensive understanding of molecular mechanisms of how genetic and environmental perturbations influence developmental processes and formation of complex phenotypes.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.Accession numbersBCWF01000001-BCWF01000044FundingThis study was supported by the Project of ENCODE of Tobacco Genome (No.110201401012 (JY-12), No.110201601033 (JY-07)), and Natural Science Foundation of Zhejiang Province (LY20C150004).Conflict of interestNone declared.Supplementary data"

IntroductionCornus officinalis, a deciduous tree from Cornaceae family and indigenous to eastern Asia, is well known for its medicinal properties.1 Fruits of C. officinalis, Corni Fructus, also referred as ‘Sanshuyu’ in Japanese and ‘shan zhu yú’ in Chinese, is an essential ingredient of several Kampo and Traditional Chinese medicinal formulations including Hachimi-gan and Rokumi-gan, among others.2 It is characterized to nourish liver and kidney and is often used for the treatment of kidney diseases, including diabetic nephropathy. Pharmacological studies using metabolite extracts from its fruits have shown to possess a wide range of therapeutic properties, including anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidants, anti-bacterial, anti-dementia, anti-hyperglycaemia, anti-aging, and neural protection.3,4 While pericarp of C. officinalis is primarily used as ingredients for different medicinal preparations, several studies have also reported biological activities for the leaf and seed extracts.5–7 Because of the wide range of medicinal properties, Corni Fructus is one of the 25 plant-based drugs most commonly used in China, Japan, and Korea.8Till date, 305 metabolites from broad chemical families, including alkaloids, iridoids, flavones, terpenoids, polysaccharides, tannins, and essential oils, have been reported from different tissues of C. officinalis.3 Among these specialized metabolites, iridoids are regarded as the principal constituents of its medicinal properties.4 The Chinese pharmacopeia considers iridoids, namely, morroniside and loganin, to constitute a minimum of 1.2% of the extracted metabolites from the C. officinalis tissues for being regarded as suitable for use in pharmaceutical applications.3 Iridoid glycosides from C. officinalis extracts such as loganin, morroniside, and cornuside are known to possess neuroprotective, cardioprotective, hypoglycaemic, anti-osteoporotic, anti-oxidant, anti-tumour, anti-diabetic, and anti-dementia activities.9–12 Triterpenoids, including ursolic acid and oleanolic acid, have been reported to possess anti-cancer, anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidative, hepatoprotective, anti-ulcer, hypolipidemic, and anti-atherosclerotic activity.13–15 Tannins, including tri-O-galloyl-ß-d-glucose and tetra-O-galloyl-ß-d-glucose, are reported to have neuroprotective activity, while isoterchebin, tellimagrandin I, and gallic acid are known to prevent Alzheimer’s disease.16–18Despite being a rich source of diverse metabolic content of known pharmacological properties, limited omics-resources for C. officinalis have restricted applications of biotechnology tools for species improvement and elucidation of biosynthetic pathways of these valuable metabolites. RNA-seq-based de novo transcriptome assemblies of non-model medicinal plants have proven to be a valuable genomic resource to facilitate the identification of key enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of target metabolites.19,20 RNA-seq approach assigns transcripts to different enzyme classes and families based on sequence similarity. This approach leads to multiple transcripts being assigned to a single biochemical reaction step21,22 due to the genomic redundancies in the plant kingdom. Hence, the homology-based approach by itself is not enough for narrowing down or prioritizing candidate genes involved in the biochemical reactions for further functional characterization.Co-expression analysis as a mean to prioritize genes for functional characterization has served plant biologist well and have contributed to our present understanding of specialized metabolite biosynthesis pathways such as iridoids and triterpenoids among others.19,23 Biosynthesis of specialized metabolites involves a minimal set of core molecules, which then serve as the substrate for enzyme families such as cytochrome P450s (CYPs), glycosyltransferases, and acyltransferases among others to result in the enormous chemodiversity, a characteristic of plant metabolome.19,24 Integrating co-expression with other omics datasets further narrow down candidate gene lists by excluding false-positive gene candidates for functional characterization. Co-expression analysis, complemented with correlation-based integration of metabolome and transcriptome dataset, is established as an efficient approach facilitating the discovery of novel genes.25–27 While several studies have adopted targeted analysis to identify metabolites present in C. officinalis,3,4 information on the differential accumulation of specialized metabolites and biosynthesis across different tissues continues to be limited. Here, we performed an untargeted metabolome analysis of C. officinalis using seven tissues, namely, young leaf, mature leaf, young stem, mature stem, pericarp, seed, and inflorescence (Fig. 1). The same set of seven tissues was used to derive de novo transcriptome assembly of C. officinalis, and subsequently for the co-expression analysis to characterize the biosynthetic pathways of its therapeutic metabolites. Using untargeted metabolome analysis, we explored the differential distribution of specialized metabolite classes, including iridoids, triterpenoids, and gallotannins, in C. officinalis. Further, sequence-similarity-based annotation of the transcriptome dataset together with their co-expression analysis was used to assign candidate genes to their biosynthetic pathway. Homology-based sequence analysis coupled with transcriptome and metabolome data integration allowed us to propose candidate cytochrome P450s associated with iridoids metabolism. Connection network-based correlation analysis between iridoids and cytochrome P450s together with the assigned biosynthetic genes identified seven CYPs as the strongest candidate among the identified CYPs for further functional characterization. Our study thus provided valuable insights into the specialized metabolites biosynthetic pathway in C. officinalis. The metabolome and transcriptome resources established in this study, together with proposed candidate CYPs will facilitate better understanding of the biosynthesis and regulation of metabolic pathways present in C. officinalis.Tissues used for the systems-level study on the biosynthesis of specialized metabolites in Cornus officinalis.

Plant materialCornus officinalis plants were maintained under natural conditions at the medicinal garden, Chiba University. All the seven tissues of C. officinalis, namely, young leaf, mature leaf, young stem, mature stem, pericarp, seed, and inflorescence (Fig. 1) were harvested on ice and immediately snap-frozen using liquid nitrogen. The harvested tissues were then stored at -80°C until further processing.2.2. Untargeted metabolite profilingThe tissues were freeze-dried using a freeze dryer (FDU-2200, Tokyo Rika-Kikai, Japan). The samples were added with 50 µl of HPLC-grade methanol (Wako, Japan) and 2.5 µM of lidocaine (Wako, Japan) per milligram of dry weight. Further, the mixture was homogenized using mixer mill (MM300, Retsch) with zirconia beads for 7 min at 18 Hz, 4°C, and then centrifuged at 15,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was subsequently filtered using a 96-well Oasis HLB µElution plate (Waters Inc., USA). The MS and MS/MS (MS2) datasets were acquired as described previously.28 The extracts (1 µl) were analysed using LC-QTOF-MS (LC, Waters Acquity UPLC system; MS, Waters Xevo G2 Q-Tof). Analytical conditions were as follows; LC: column, Acquity bridged ethyl hybrid C18 (1.7 µm, 2.1 mm × 100 mm, Waters); solvent system, solvent A (water including 0.1% formic acid) and solvent B (acetonitrile including 0.1% formic acid); gradient programme, 99.5%A/0.5%B at 0 min, 99.5%A/0.5%B at 0.1 min, 20%A/80%B at 10 min, 0.5%A/99.5%B at 10.1 min, 0.5%A/99.5%B at 12.0 min, 99.5%A/0.5%B at 12.1 min and 99.5%A/0.5%B at 15.0 min; flow rate, 0.3 ml/min at 0 min, 0.3 ml/min at 10 min, 0.4 ml/min at 10.1 min, 0.4 ml/min at 14.4 min, and 0.3 ml/min at 14.5 min; column temperature, 40°C; MS detection: capillary voltage, +3.0 keV, cone voltage, 25.0 V, source temperature, 120°C, desolvation temperature, 450°C, cone gas flow, 50 l/h; desolvation gas flow, 800 l/h; collision energy, 6 V; mass range, m/z 100-1,500; scan duration, 0.1 s; inter-scan delay, 0.014 s; data acquisition, centroid mode; polarity, positive: scan duration, 1.0 s; inter-scan delay, 0.1 s. MS2 data were acquired in the ramp mode as the following analytical conditions: (1) MS: mass range, m/z 50–1,500; scan duration, 0.1 s; inter-scan delay, 0.014 s; data acquisition, centroid mode; polarity, positive/negative; and (2) MS2: mass range, m/z 50–1,500; scan duration, 0.02 s; inter-scan delay, 0.014 s; data acquisition, centroid mode; polarity, positive/negative collision energy, ramped from 10 to 50 V. The MS2 spectra of the top 10 ions, with counts over 1,000 in MS scan, were acquired and moved further to the next top 10 ions based on MS-scan at a given run-time, while the acquisition was not performed if the ion intensity was <1,000. Data were processed using MS-DIAL29 with default parameters. Metabolite peaks were normalized through comparison with lidocaine (internal standard) and were used for Principal Component Analysis (PCA). To assign putative chemical identities to the acquired metabolite peaks, they were mapped onto the KNApSAcK database30 and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathway database.31For MS2-based validation of metabolites’ identity, we first prepared a comprehensive list of metabolites being previously reported in the Cornus genus and used it as a database to explore mass-features identified in C. officinalis. Subsequently, mass-features with mass-error of 10 ppm or less, when compared with previously reported metabolites, were selected and analysed further by MS-FINDER.32 Chemical identities were assigned to the mass-features by matching the MS2 fragmentation pattern with the MS2 ions of the corresponding metabolite as reported in previous studies or as predicted by in silico fragmentation by MS-FINDER as described elsewhere.332.3. RNA isolation, cDNA synthesis, and library constructionThe tissue samples were homogenized for RNA extraction. RNA samples with RNA integrity number over 8.0 were used for cDNA library synthesis. The extraction of RNA, RNA integrity analysis to check the quality of RNA, and synthesis of the corresponding cDNA libraries were performed as described elsewhere.342.4. Illumina sequencing and transcriptome assemblyThe cDNA libraries generated for different tissues of C. officinalis were sequenced using Illumina HiSeq™ 2000 (Illumina Inc., USA) to obtain paired-end read with an average read-length of 101 bps. The construction of cDNA libraries and their sequencing were performed at Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Japan. The raw sequence reads were then pre-processed to remove adaptor sequences, low-quality reads, short-read as well as ambiguous read sequences, using Trimmomatic programme.35 The high-quality reads were subsequently used to generate de novo transcriptome assembly.For the generation of de novo transcriptome assembly, three popular assemblers, namely, CLC genomics workbench (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/, 8 May 2020, date last accessed), Trinity36 with default parameters, and SOAPdenovo-Trans37 with six different k-mer sizes, namely, 31, 41, 51, 63, 71, and 91, were used. The transcriptome assembly resulting from SOAPdenovo-Trans with k-mer 41 showed best assembly statistics compared with other used k-mers and was selected for further use. The SOAPdenovo-Trans assembly (k-mer size 41) was concatenated with individual assembly derived from Trinity and CLC genomics workbench (Table 1). The concatenated transcriptome assembly was further processed using CD-HIT-EST38 to remove any sequence redundancy, as described previously.34 For assessing the completeness of C. officinalis transcriptome assembly, we performed Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO v.3.0.2) analysis39,40 using embryophyta_odb10 database.Summary of assembly statistics for de novo transcriptome assembly of Cornus officinalis based on three popular assemblers and their combinationSummary of assembly statistics for de novo transcriptome assembly of Cornus officinalis based on three popular assemblers and their combination2.5. Functional annotation, classification of assembled unigenes, and KEGG pathway mappingFor annotation of the de novo transcriptome assembly of C. officinalis, Blastx-based homology search was performed against the NCBI-non-redundant (NCBI-nr) database with an E-value cut-off as 1E-5, and the maximum number of hits set as 20. The top-blast hit was used to annotate the de novo transcriptome assembly. Subsequently, the associated EC number, GO terms, and KEGG pathway-based annotation was retrieved using BLAST2GO software.412.6. Microsatellite detectionThe de novo transcriptome assembly of C. officinalis was analysed to identify the composition, frequency, and distribution of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) using MISA software.42 The search parameters were similar to as described elsewhere.34 The identified microsatellites and identification summary are provided in Table 2 and Supplementary Table S5.Statistics of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) detected in Cornus officinalisStatistics of simple sequence repeats (SSRs) detected in Cornus officinalis2.7. Expression analysis and assigning unigenes to specialized metabolite biosynthesis pathwayThe processed RNA-seq reads for an individual tissue were mapped to the de novo transcriptome assembly of C. officinalis using Bowtie 2.0 programme.43 Subsequently, RSEM programme44 was used to estimate transcripts expression as Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKM) values, which were subsequently used to calculate the correlation between transcriptome profiling dataset of all seven tissues. Candidate genes for iridoids, triterpenoids, and gallotannins biosynthesis pathways were assigned using sequence homology and co-expression analysis, as previously described.45 Briefly, unigenes annotated as enzymes based on sequence similarity for a biosynthesis pathway under consideration were selected and used for co-expression analysis. Hierarchical clustering using the co-expression matrix identified a single gene cluster representing all known enzymes for an individual biosynthesis pathway. Previous studies have shown the co-expression of genes associated with iriroids,46–49 triterpenoids,34,50–52 and several others specialized metabolites biosynthetic pathways. Therefore, unigenes from these highly co-expressed gene clusters were assigned to the respective biosynthesis pathways.2.8. Integrative data analysisThe transcripts annotated as cytochrome P450 with a length of over 500 bp and expression in FPKM values over five in at least one of the seven tissues were filtered. Subsequently, the Spearman matrix-based correlation analysis was performed between the filtered CYPs and identified metabolites classified as iridoids in this study. For this, the expression data of selected CYPs across seven tissues were used together with the intensities for iridoids (as total peak area) to calculate the Spearman correlation coefficient. The CYPs with a higher correlation coefficient (R2>0.85) was selected as the candidate CYPs. Further, the correlation of those candidate CYPs was calculated with the genes assigned to the iridoid biosynthetic pathway. Cytoscape53 (version 3.7.2) was used to visualize the relationship between the iridoids and candidate CYPs.2.9. Phylogenetic analysisThe selected candidate CYPs were translated to their corresponding protein using the Translate tool from ExPASy (https://web.expasy.org/translate/, 8 May 2020, date last accessed) by selecting the translation frame that resulted in the longest amino acid sequence while starting with methionine. Protein sequences of the candidate transcripts together with representatives of major CYP families reported in plants were aligned using MUSCLE programme,54 and evolutionary history was inferred using the Maximum Likelihood method adopting Dayhoff w/freq model using MEGA X software,55 with bootstrap values of 1,000.3. Results and discussion3.1. Untargeted metabolic profiling revealed complex metaboconstituents of Cornus officinalisIn order to understand the metabo-constitutes of C. officinalis across different tissues, we extracted metabolites from seven tissues of C. officinalis and performed untargeted metabolic profiling (Fig. 1). The acquired raw-data were pre-processed for peak detection and alignment using MS-DIAL,29 resulting in a total of 11,017 mass-features in the positive ion mode (Supplementary Table S1). PCA using the normalized intensities for the aligned mass-features showed seven tissues separated as four distinct groups along PC1 and PC2 axes (Fig. 2A). Young leaf and mature leaf were grouped and separated along the PC1 axis with another group constituting young stem, mature stem, and inflorescence. Pericarp and seed tissues were separated along the PC2 axis as distinct tissue groups. The PCA score plot validates the quality of acquired metabolite profiling dataset as we efficiently captured the tissue-wise accumulation of metabolites that contributes to their specific medicinal uses.Untargeted metabolome analysis for seven tissues of Cornus officinalis.

(A) Principal component analysis using metabolome profiling for seven tissues of C. officinalis. (B) The top 20 KEGG pathways based on the number of assigned metabolites being detected in this study.In an attempt to gain insights into the overall metabo-constitutes of C. officinalis, the acquired mass-features were searched against the KNApSAcK database30 with an allowed mass-error window of 10 ppm. In total, we assigned 2,155 mass-features to a corresponding KNApSAcK ID (Supplementary Table S2). Further, to explore the active metabolic pathways in C. officinalis, the aligned mass-features were mapped to the KEGG pathway database.31 The top three KEGG pathways based on the number of mass-features being assigned included metabolic pathways, biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, and biosynthesis of plant secondary metabolites (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S2). The top 20 KEGG pathways assigned to C. officinalis metabolome datasets also included several secondary metabolic pathways including biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids, biosynthesis of alkaloids derived from the shikimate pathway, biosynthesis of alkaloids derived from ornithine, lysine, and nicotinic acid, flavonoid biosynthesis, carotenoid biosynthesis, anthocyanin biosynthesis, and biosynthesis of type II polyketide products. Metabolites mapped to the KEGG pathways corresponding to the biosynthesis of alkaloids and flavonoids were highly accumulated in inflorescence, mature stem and young stem (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B and Table S1), while those mapped to the biosynthesis of phenylpropanoids were highly accumulated in pericarp and mature stem (Supplementary Fig. S1C). The majority of the metabolites corresponding to the biosynthesis of terpenoids was highly accumulated in mature leaf and young stem of C. officinalis (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Untargeted metabolite profiling using multiple tissues of C. officinalis revealed rich chemo-diversity of specialized metabolites accounts for its broad medicinal properties. Against 305 metabolites being previously reported in C. officinalis,3 the number of mass-features putatively assigned to specialized metabolites in this study suggests the presence of hundreds of metabolites never reported before. While structural determination and compound identification for all of these metabolites seem unfeasible due to technical limitations, nonetheless our data does represent characteristic plant metabolite diversity. The putatively assigned mass-features can serve as candidates for future validation and structural determination, the discovery of which could be prioritized based on its pharmacological importance. Therefore, the metabolome data obtained in this study will be a valuable resource in exploring the metabolic pathways present in C. officinalis.3.2. Accumulation of specialized bioactive metabolites in Cornus officinalis occurs in a tissue-specific mannerFrom the mass-features detected in our metabolome dataset, we focused on specialized metabolites reported from Cornus genus and identified a total of 49 metabolites through investigation of their MS2-based fragmentation pattern summarized in Supplementary Table S3. Correlation based on the accumulation pattern of these 49 metabolites across seven tissues is shown as a heatmap in Fig. 3A. Metabolites were grouped into four clusters, and their accumulation trends were primarily based on the associated chemical families. Metabolites in cluster 1, 50% of which included phenylpropanoids, were highly accumulated in young leaf and mature leaf of C. officinalis (Fig. 3B). Cluster 2, predominantly constituted of gallotannins, was highly accumulated in seed except for ellagic acid, which showed the highest accumulation in inflorescence of C. officinalis (Fig. 3C). Cluster 3 included all the four triterpenoids and 60% of all the iridoids being identified in this study, with higher accumulation in young stem, mature stem, and inflorescence of C. officinalis (Fig. 3D). Morroniside, an iridoid grouped in this cluster, was an exception having the highest accumulation in pericarp. Cluster 4, including two iridoids, namely, loganin and verbenalin together with few other metabolites, was highly accumulated in pericarp of C. officinalis (Fig. 3E). Morroniside and loganin, which are the standards described by Chinese pharmacopeia for the assessment of herb quality, were highly accumulated in pericarp and are consistent with the tissue primarily being used for the medicinal purpose.3 Correlation of metabolites from the same chemical families have previously been reported in Arabidopsis56 and tomato,57 and our results showed similar metabo-properties in C. officinalis.Correlation analysis and accumulation pattern of MS2 confirmed metabolites in Cornus officinalis. (A) Spearman correlation coefficients were calculated between chemically assigned metabolites using accumulation levels across seven tissues of C. officinalis. Correlation scores are plotted as a heatmap with corresponding metabolite names represented along the X- and Y-axes. Hierarchical clustering based on correlation scores for metabolites formed four distinct groups, named as four metabolite clusters. (B–E) Accumulation of metabolites grouped into four distinct metabolite clusters across seven tissues of C. officinalis. Circle, square, diamond, and triangle shapes before the names of chemically assigned metabolites correspond to iridoids, gallotannins, triterpenoids, and phenylpropanoids metabolite families, respectively.Correlation analysis and accumulation pattern of MS2 confirmed metabolites in Cornus officinalis.

Results obtained from this study, therefore, clearly suggest the importance of different tissues apart from fruits for the extraction of bioactive metabolites.3.3. De novo transcriptome assembly established simple sequence repeats database of Cornus officinalisFor a comprehensive representation of C. officinalis transcriptome, we conducted RNA-sequencing of the same seven tissues that were used for metabolome analysis. The sequencing reads were processed using Trimmomatic programme,35 resulting in over 15.1 Gbp clean sequencing reads (Supplementary Table S4). These sequencing reads were subsequently used to derive the de novo transcriptome assembly. In order to enhance the contiguity of assembly and maximize the diversity of assembled transcripts, we derived de novo transcriptome assembly by concatenating the primary assemblies generated using Trinity,36 SOAPdenovo-Trans,37 and CLC genomics workbench (https://www.qiagenbioinformatics.com/, 8 May 2020, date last accessed), following which the redundancies were removed using CD-HIT-EST programme.38 The final hybrid de novo transcriptome assembly included a total of 304,371 unigenes with an average length and N50 as 742 and 1,250 bp, respectively (Table 1). For the quantitative assessment of the C. officinalis de novo transcriptome assembly, we performed BUSCO analysis39 using 1,614 conserved gene clusters across 60 plant species. BUSCO analysis determined 96% completeness of our assembly, thus demonstrating excellent gene representation of C. officinalis transcriptome assembly. Among identified genes, 365 (22.6%) were complete and single-copy genes, 1,184 (73.4%) were completed and duplicated genes, and 34 (2.1%) were fragmented genes (Supplementary Fig. S2A). A high percentage of duplicated genes identified by BUSCO analysis may suggest a potential whole-genome duplication event for C. officinalis. The length of the assembled unigenes of C. officinalis ranged between 196 and 15,677 bps, with the length of 179,678 unigenes <500 bps and 1,068 unigenes with length over 5,000 bps (Supplementary Fig. S2B).We scanned the de novo transcriptome assembly using MISA software42 to identify SSRs in C. officinalis. SSRs are short DNA stretches consisting of a 1–6 nucleotide motif repeated, several times in tandem. SSRs undergo rapid mutation resulting in the genetic diversification among closely related species, and hence are considered as a marker for determining genetic variations with close and distant plant species.58,59 In total, 95,533 SSRs were identified, of which di-nucleotide repeat classes formed the largest fraction (47.9%), followed by mono- (40.4%) and tri-nucleotide (10.2%) repeat classes (Table 2). The tetra-, penta-, and hexa-nucleotide repeat classes account for only a small fraction of the total SSRs identified in C. officinalis. All the identified SSRs in C. officinalis has been listed in Supplementary Table S5. SSRs are widely used to access genetic diversity, for the development of the genetic map, and therefore, represent valuable resources being used for population genetic studies.60,61 The SSRs of C. officinalis identified in this study would serve as an important resource for the determination of functional genetic variation in future studies.3.4. Functional characterization and expression analysis using de novo transcriptome of Cornus officinalisThe assembled unigenes were subsequently used for annotation to understand their putative function within the biological system. Overall, 140,343 transcripts constituting about 46.1% of the total assembled unigenes were annotated based on their homology search against the NCBI-nr database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov, 8 May 2020, date last accessed; formatted on February 2019, Fig. 4A, Supplementary Table S6). Results obtained from Blastx-based annotation showed that the majority of the sequences had significant homology against the sequences present in the NCBI-nr database, with 79,312 unigenes having over 80% sequence-similarity with its corresponding hit (Supplementary Fig. S2C). Top-hit species distribution showed that the assembled unigenes of C. officinalis had high sequence-similarity with sequences from Vitis vinifera, Nelumbo nucifera, Theobromo cacao, Juglans regia, and Ziziphus jujube (Fig. 4B). Despite being an Asterid and from the Cornales order, the first five top-hit species based on Blastx analysis belong to Rosids or early-diverging eudicots, which could very well be due to greater representation of sequenced plant genomes from Rosids clade. The results from Blastx search were used to assign gene ontology (GO) terms, enzyme commission (EC) number, and associated KEGG pathway using BLAST2GO software.41 Of the 140,343 annotated unigenes, 117,436 unigenes were assigned with a GO-term under three major GO-categories, namely, cellular component, molecular function, and biological process. The GO-terms having the maximum number of assigned unigenes included intracellular, heterocyclic compound binding, and organic substance metabolic processes under the cellular component, molecular function, and biological process category, respectively (Fig. 4C). KEGG database-based pathway mapping of the assembled unigenes resulted in 33,590 unigenes being assigned to 144 pathways (Supplementary Table S7). Top 20 KEGG pathways based on the number of transcripts being assigned are summarized in Fig. 4D. Annotation and functional characterization of C. officinalis transcriptome assembly captured all major biosynthesis pathways and complete coverage of the active biological processes, thus confirming the suitability of this resource to perform down-stream applications, including co-expression and integrative omics analysis.Functional annotation of the de novo transcriptome assembly of Cornus officinalis.

Among the tissues, young stem with 151,729 unigenes and seed with 146,245 unigenes showed the highest number of transcriptionally active unigenes (FPKM > 0). In comparison, mature stem with 70,055 unigenes had the lowest number of transcriptionally active unigenes. The transcriptome profiling revealed that tissues undertaken in this study have relatively distinct ongoing metabolic processes with only 5,969 (1.96%) actively expressed unigenes being shared between seven tissues, while 94,183 (30.94%) unigenes were exclusively expressed in only one of the seven tissues of C. officinalis (Supplementary Fig. S3A). These results were consistent with metabolite accumulation analysis, which also showed tissue-specific accumulation of specialized metabolites (Fig. 3). Further, we performed expression-based correlation analysis to understand the global relationship between different tissues of C. officinalis at the transcriptome level. Broadly, the correlation analysis revealed two groups with mature stem forming a separate group and the rest of the six tissues forming the second group (Supplementary Fig. S3B). Within the second group, seed and pericarp formed individual groups, while young and mature leaf, as well as young stem and inflorescence, were clustered together. These results indicate that the presence of tissue-specific unigenes associated with each tissue and the overlap of unigenes’ expression can be primarily attributed to their developmental stages and tissue-types. Co-expression analysis showed that the expression for unigenes in C. officinalis captured tissue-specific features, and in extension, the biological relevance of key gene expression and associated biological processes. The transcriptome dataset reported in this study, therefore, provides a valuable framework to analyse further the candidate genes participating in the biosynthesis of pharmacologically active metabolites.3.5. Iridoids and triterpenoids showed correlated gene expression and metabolite accumulation in Cornus officinalisIridoids and triterpenoids are the two most important classes of phytochemicals that attributes to the medicinal properties of C. officinalis.3,4 Isopentenyl phosphate and dimethylallyl phosphate, derived from the mevalonate (MVA) pathway and non-mevalonate (MEP) pathway, undergoes cyclization catalyzed either by GPPS or by FPPS to form geranyl diphosphate (GDP) and farnesyl diphosphate (FDP), respectively. GDP and FDP undergo a series of reactions leading to the biosynthesis of iridoids and triterpenoids, respectively. In order to identify the candidate genes associated with the biosynthesis of iridoids and triterpenoids, the transcriptome assembly of C. officinalis was screened for transcripts annotated as enzymes involved in these two biosynthetic pathways. In total, we identified 182 and 83 transcripts for triterpenoid and iridoid biosynthetic pathways, respectively (Supplementary Table S8). Previous studies have shown co-expression for genes associated with triterpenoids and iridoids biosynthesis pathways across multiple plant species.34,46–52,62–64 In order to narrow down genes participating in the triterpenoid/iridoid biosynthetic pathway, we performed correlation cluster analysis of all the transcripts across all the seven tissues.Correlation analysis based on the expression of transcripts annotated as enzymes associated with the triterpenoid biosynthetic pathway followed by hierarchical clustering revealed a highly co-expressed gene cluster including 29 transcripts, representing eight known enzymes from the triterpenoid biosynthetic pathway (Fig. 5A and Supplementary Fig. S4). Therefore, we selected these 29 transcripts as the candidate genes associated with the biosynthesis of triterpenoids in C. officinalis. The expression of these candidate transcripts was highest in the young stem, followed by inflorescence, while low expression was detected for seed, leaf, and pericarp (Fig. 5B). The expression trends of the candidate genes were consistent with the accumulation of all the four triterpenoids, namely, ursolic acid, oleanolic acid, 2a-Hydroxy ursolic acid, and 2a-Hydroxy oleanolic acid (Supplementary Fig. S5). Therefore, we assigned these 29 transcripts as the candidate genes associated with the biosynthesis of triterpenoids in C. officinalis.Expression of transcripts assigned to triterpenoids’, and iridoids’ biosynthetic pathways across seven tissues in Cornus officinalis.

These 31 genes were selected as the potential candidate genes associated with the biosynthesis of iridoids in C. officinalis. Expression analysis of these candidate transcripts showed the highest expression in the young stem, followed by inflorescence and pericarp (Fig. 5D). Similar to the expression trend of candidate transcripts, the metabolome analysis also showed a consistent accumulation trend for the majority of iridoids identified in this study (Supplementary Fig. S7). The accumulation of loganin and morroniside, the two principal pharmaceutical compounds of C. officinalis, was highest in pericarp and is in accordance with the tissue being primarily used for medicinal purposes. While our study indicates the significance of C. officinalis fruits for medicinal purposes, it also suggests the relevance of young stem and inflorescence for use in traditional medicine formulations or for deriving important medicinal compounds from C. officinalis.3.6. Transcripts expression and metabolome analysis suggest different sites for the biosynthesis and accumulation of gallotannins in Cornus officinalisGallotannins, which contains at least one moiety each of galloyl and sugar/cyclitol, are essential constituents of the metabolite pool of C. officinalis. They are known to impart anti-oxidative, neuroprotective, and hepatoprotective properties to C. officinalis.16,17,65 In order to identify transcripts associated with biosynthesis of gallotannins in C. officinalis, the transcriptome assembly was searched for the transcripts annotated as enzymes known to be involved in the biosynthesis of gallotannins (Fig. 6A). In total, we identified 37 transcripts, correlation analysis of which revealed a highly co-expressed gene cluster of 15 transcripts, representing five known enzymes of gallotannins biosynthetic pathway (Supplementary Fig. S8 and Table S9). Therefore, these 15 transcripts were selected as candidate genes associated with the biosynthesis of gallotannins in C. officinalis (Fig. 6B). While the majority of the candidate transcripts was highly expressed in young leaf, followed by mature leaf and inflorescence, the majority of gallotannins identified in the metabolome dataset showed the highest accumulation in the seed, which is in accordance with the findings, reported earlier66 (Supplementary Fig. S9). Few of the gallotannins, including gemin D, tellimagrandin I, and 1-O-galloyl-ß-D-glucose, were significantly accumulated in young leaf and mature leaf. These results suggest that the early precursors in the biosynthesis of gallotannins are probably synthesized in the leaf tissue, which is then transported to the seeds where further synthesis and modifications occur. Generally, tannins are known to accumulate in the seeds, while the biosynthesis pathway is localized to leaves and other tissues.Expression of transcripts assigned to gallotannins’ biosynthetic pathway across seven tissues in Cornus officinalis.

Network-based integrative omics analysis reveals seven cytochrome P450s involved in the metabolism of iridoidsCytochrome P450s play a vital role in the diversification of metabolite pool via catalyzing modification reaction, including oxidation, hydroxylation, alkylation, and esterification of the core skeleton molecule.67,68 While several previous studies and our results have shown the presence of a diverse range of iridoids in C. officinalis,3,4,69–71 there exists limited information on the CYPs that may participate in its biosynthesis and diversification. Therefore, we adopted a metabolome guided approach to assign candidate CYPs to the iridoid biosynthetic pathway. The de novo transcriptome assembly was screened to identify transcripts annotated as cytochrome P450s, resulting in a total of 822 transcripts. Among these, 262 CYPs with a length of at least 500 bps and FPKM value of 5 in at least one of the seven tissues were selected for subsequent analysis (Supplementary Table S10). These selected CYPs were used to perform Spearman’s data matrix-based correlation together with the identified iridoids in our metabolome dataset, which showed 45 transcripts to be highly correlated with at least one of the 15 iridoids with R2 > 0.85 (Supplementary Fig. S10 and Table S11). Among transcripts, seven were highly correlated with at least 50% of the assigned biosynthetic enzymes, and therefore represent strong candidates with a putative function in the iridoids biosynthesis and diversification in C. officinalis. Subsequently, phylogenetic analysis of these seven transcripts was performed together with 61 CYPs representing all the known clans of cytochrome P450s across different plant species. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that three of the seven transcripts were grouped in CYP71-clan (A-type), while remaining of them were grouped in CYP72-, CYP74-, CYP711-, and CYP86-clan, respectively (Fig. 7). CYP71-clan represents the largest clan of CYP constituting over 50% of the plant CYPs, members of which are known to have a diverse range of functions, particularly in plant’s specialized metabolism. CYP71-clan is exclusive to the land plants and is reported to have undergone several successive gene duplication events resulting in the evolution of species-specific novel genes participating in plant’s secondary metabolism.67,68 Within the transcripts grouped in the CYP71-clan, two of them were phylogenetically close to CYP82C4 and CYP82G1 of Arabidopsis, and CYP81AA1 of Hypericum calycinum. CYP82C4 and CYP82G1 catalyze the hydroxylation reaction of 8-methoxypsoralen, and cleavage reaction of (E, E)-geranyllinalool to yield homoterpene volatiles, respectively.72 CYP81AA1 is known to participate in the biosynthesis of plant xanthones.73 Previous studies have reported diverse functions, including hydroxylation and demethylation with a role in alkaloid biosynthesis, for members of the CYP82 family.74–76 The wide range of activity and substrate-specificity for members of CYP82 family within CYP71-clan may suggest that three transcripts of C. officinalis grouped herein may have a potential role in the biosynthesis of iridoids in C. officinalis. Among the transcripts grouped within non-A type CYPs, Unigene106754 was clustered in the CYP72-clan. CYP72A1 from Catharanthus roseus is known to participate in secologanin biosynthesis77 and, therefore, Unigene106754 represents a prominent candidate that may participate in the biosynthesis of iridoids in C. officinalis. Phylogenetic analysis of the transcripts annotated as cytochrome P450s, as narrowed down by the metabolome guided approach, facilitated the identification of three CYPs representing potential candidates participating in the biosynthesis of iridoids in C. officinalis. Further functional characterization of the identified CYPs will help in ascertaining their role in the iridoids’ metabolism in C. officinalis.Phylogenetic analysis of the candidate transcripts annotated as cytochrome P450s in Cornus officinalis together with CYPs representing major-classes of plant CYPs.

ConclusionIn this study, we investigated the biosynthesis of pharmacologically important specialized metabolites in C. officinalis through RNA-sequencing and untargeted metabolome analyses. We identified 1,215 metabolites via mapping the mass-features on to the KEGG pathway database and reported the accumulation pattern of MS2 confirmed 49 metabolites across seven tissues of C. officinalis. Our results showed that not only the fruit, the tissue used for all major traditional medicine purposes, but also other tissues such as young leaves and stems are an equally potent source of medicinal compounds. We used multi-omics analysis to identify candidate genes involved in the biosynthetic pathway of iridoids, triterpenoids, and gallotannins, the dominant group of bioactive metabolites in C. officinalis. Correlation-based integration of the transcriptome and metabolome dataset and network-based analysis helped in the identification of 45 cytochrome P450s showing a high correlation with iridoids. Further analyses of those highly correlated CYPs strongly suggested the putative involvement of three CYPs participating in the iridoid metabolisms in C. officinalis. Besides, the transcriptome and metabolome resources being established in this study will lay the foundation for screening novel metabolites present in C. officinalis and future studies on their biosynthesis through functional characterization of associated transcripts discovered in this study.4.1.

IntroductionSaprotrophic fungi of Northern Hemisphere and tropical forests impact the carbon cycling through mineralization and alteration of C storage in wood and litter dead organic matter.1,2 White-rot (WR) fungi are wood decayers with the capacity to mineralize lignin with ultimate formation of CO2 and H2O.3. WR fungi deploy a wide arsenal of hydrolytic and oxidative enzymes to degrade wood and their genomes typically contain genes coding for glycoside hydrolases, carbohydrate esterases and polysaccharide lyases that collectively cleave cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin backbones and lateral chains, and oxidative enzymes that target the highly recalcitrant lignin, crystalline cellulose or cellulose-bound xylan.4,5 Beyond these shared features, several studies have highlighted significant polymorphism between WR fungi regarding their ability to selectively degrade lignin over cellulose6–8 and in the gene portfolios involved in lignocellulose breakdown.9–11 Scarce studies at the intra-genus level have shown that functional diversity between species may arise from diversity in gene content.12,13Among WR fungi, the genus Pycnoporus (Basidiomycota, Agaricomycetes) has been studied for the efficiency of lignin degradation, the capacity to secrete laccases and biotechnological applications related to aromatic compound functionalization, biopolymer synthesis and biomass pre-treatment in the pulp and paper industry.14 Four Pycnoporus species have been differentiated,15,16 which form a monophyletic group within the Trametes clade.17 The four species are found in different geo-climatic areas with limited geographical overlap; P. cinnabarinus is widely distributed in the Northern hemisphere, P. coccineus is found in countries bordering the Indian and Pacific Oceans, P. sanguineus is found in the tropics and subtropics of both hemispheres and P. puniceus is found in paleotropical areas.15,16 The four species are found on stumps and either standing or fallen trunks of deciduous trees.Our aim was to investigate the Pycnoporus intra-genus genomic and functional diversity focusing on lignocellulose breakdown. We examined whether divergence in distinct geographic areas had led to genomic diversity, and if there was a signature of conserved enzymatic mechanics in terms of transcriptome and exo-proteome responses to lignocellulosic substrates. We sequenced the genomes of P. coccineus, P. sanguineus and P. puniceus monokaryotic strains. We overviewed the genomic features among the three species, in comparison to the previously sequenced genome of P. cinnabarinus9 and to other evolutionarily related wood-decay fungi. Then, we captured the transcriptomic and exoproteomic responses of three Pycnoporus species to a panel of cellulosic and lignocellulosic substrates representative of Gramineae and hardwoods. The focus was the early responses to the substrates in order to minimize inter-species differences influenced by varied growth abilities on the substrates. Our omics integrative approach enabled to identify a common set of lignocellulose-degrading enzymes mobilized by the fungi at the initial stage of lignocellulose degradation, leading to discoveries of genus-wide conserved expression patterns indicative of conserved enzymatic synergies.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome sequencing and assemblyThe monokaryotic strains P. coccineus BRFM 310, P. sanguineus BRFM 1264 and P. puniceus BRFM 1868 were generated after fruiting of the parental strains BRFM 66 (IMB WOO6-2), BRFM 902 and BRFM 1856, respectively, as described previously14 (Supplementary Information). All strains were maintained at the International Centre of Microbial Resources (CIRM; https://www6.inra.fr/cirm/). The P. coccineus BRFM 310 genome was sequenced using the Illumina platform (99.4×) and assembled with AllPathsLG version R4665218 (GenBank accession number: NCSW00000000). The P. sanguineus BRFM 1264 genome was sequenced using 454 (16.8×) and Solexa (87×) technologies and assembled with CABOG19 (GenBank accession number: VOCM00000000). The P. puniceus BRFM 1868 genome was sequenced using PacBio technology (97×) and assembled with FALCON, improved with finisherSC,20 polished with Quiver (GenBank accession number: VICQ00000000). The three genomes were annotated using the JGI annotation pipeline,21 which takes multiple inputs (scaffolds, ESTs and known genes) and runs several analytical tools for gene prediction and annotation, and deposits the results in the JGI Genome Portal MycoCosm (http://genome.jgi.doe.gov/fungi). The previously sequenced and annotated genome of P. cinnabarinus BRFM 1379 was also deposited in MycoCosm.2.2. Construction of phylogenetic treeWe constructed a phylogeny based on orthologous genes among the selected fungi using FastOrtho with the parameters set to 50% identity, 50% coverage and inflation 3.0.22 The protein sequences used for the process were downloaded from the JGI fungal portal MycoCosm. We identified the clusters of orthologous genes with single copy genes, aligned the sequences of each cluster with MAFFT 7.221,23 eliminated ambiguous regions (containing gaps and poorly aligned regions) and concatenated the alignments with Gblocks 0.91b.24 We constructed a phylogenetic tree with RAxML 7.7.225 using the standard algorithm, the PROTGAMMAWAG model of sequence evolution and 500 bootstrap replicates.2.3. Comparative genomic analysisGenome completeness with single copy orthologues was calculated using BUSCO v3.0.2 with default parameters.26 The coverage of transposable elements (TEs) in genomes was calculated using a custom pipeline transposon identification nominative genome overview.27 The counts for plant cell wall (PCW)-degrading enzymes, predicted secreted auxiliary activity (AA) enzymes and fungal cell wall (FCW)-degrading enzymes were combined and visualized with custom R scripts, proteomic information navigated genomic outlook28 incorporating R packages ggplot2, ggtree and egg.29–312.4. Expert functional annotationsGenes from the A- and B-mating type loci were identified and manually curated as described in Kues et al.32 CAZymes and AA were annotated as in Lombard et al.33 Gene models from AA2 Class II peroxidases, AA3_2 glucose-methanol-choline (GMC)-oxidoreductases and AA5 copper radical oxidases were further inspected by sequence-by-sequence exhaustive analysis and phylogenetic analysis. Peptidases were annotated using Blastx searches of gene models against InterPro and MEROPS databases34,35 followed by manual curation. Glutathione transferases (GST)-coding genes were annotated with a combination of automated blastp using functionally characterized GST sequences from P. chrysosporium,36–38 phylogenetic analysis and active site comparison. Genes coding for hydrophobins, laccases, the secretory pathway and carbon catabolism were also manually inspected. Proteins were predicted secreted if they fulfilled three conditions: (i) presence of a secretion signal peptide, (ii) absence of endoplasmic reticulum retention motif and (iii) absence of transmembrane helix outside the signal peptide, as previously described.39 Predicted secreted proteins shorter than 300 amino acids were annotated as small secreted proteins (SSPs). Detailed analyses of expert annotations are provided in the Supporting Information file.2.5. CulturesMedia for cultures on agar plates contained diammonium tartrate (1.84 g/l), yeast nitrogen base (0.17 g/l), agar (15 g/l) and were supplemented with either maltose (20 g/l), Avicel (AVI) PH 101 (Fluka) (15 g/l), ground and sifted wheat straw (WS) fragments <2 mm (15 g/l), Pinus halepensis pine wood fragments <2 mm (15 g/l) or Populus tremuloides Wiley-milled aspen (Asp) fragments (180 µm < fragment size < 2 mm; 15 g/l). The plates were inoculated with one fungal disk (4 mm diameter) of 7-day-old mycelia and incubated at 30 °C. Liquid cultures were maintained at 30 °C in a rotary shaker at 120 rpm in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 ml of culture medium (Supplementary Information) supplemented with either maltose (20 g/l), AVI (15 g/l), WS fragments (15 g/l), P. halepensis wood fragments (15 g/l) or P. tremuloides fragments (15 g/l). Each culture was done in triplicate. Inoculums of the liquid cultivations were prepared as described in Herpoël et al.402.6. Integration of transcriptome and exo-proteome profilesLC-MS/MS analysis of the secreted proteins was performed as described in Navarro et al.41 Briefly, 10 µg of diafiltered proteins were loaded on SDS-PAGE gels and allowed to migrate on a 0.5 cm length. Each lane was cut into two slices for in-gel digestion according to a standard trypsinolysis protocol. On-line analysis of the peptides was performed with a Q-exactive mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific), using a nanoelectrospray ion source. Protein identification was performed by querying MS/MS data against the genome of P. cinnabarinus BRFM 137, P. coccineus BRFM 310 or P. sanguineus BRFM 1264, together with an in-house contaminant database, using the X! Tandem Cyclone software. All peptides that matched with an E value lower than 0.05 were parsed with X! Tandem pipeline software. Proteins identified with at least two unique peptides and a log (E value) lower than -2.6 were validated.For total RNA extractions, mycelia were ground in liquid nitrogen using a Freezer/Mill Cryogenic Grinder (SPEX Sample Prep, UK). Total RNA was extracted from 100 mg ground tissue in 1 ml TRIZOL (Ambion). Nucleic acids were precipitated with isopropanol, resuspended in water and treated with RNase-Free DNase I (QIAGEN). Total RNA was precipitated with LiCl and resuspended in DEPC-treated water. RNA quantity and quality were determined using the Experion RNA StdSens kit (QIAGEN). The transcriptome response of P. sanguineus to pine could not be analysed because of poor quality of the extracted RNAs. Double stranded cDNAs were synthesized from PolyA RNA and fragmented (200–300 bp) before construction of the sequencing libraries (Kapa Library Amplification Kit; Kapa Biosystems). Sequencing was done on the Illumina HighSeq-2500 JGI platform generating paired end reads of 150 bp each. Paired end 150 bp Illumina reads were trimmed for quality and aligned to the corresponding genome using TopHat 2 with only unique mapping allowed.42 Gene models for which the mean raw read counts were inferior to 5 were considered as not transcribed and their read counts were changed to 0.The counts of mapped Illumina reads from biological triplicates of each growth condition (GEO accession number GSE82486) were normalized with the DESeq2 package and log2 transformed.43 The normalized read counts of genes coding for CAZymes, peptidases, hydrophobins and SSPs from P. cinnabarinus BRFM 137, P. coccineus BRFM 310 and P. sanguineus BRFM 1264 were retrieved and combined by conducting; (i) removal of batch effects with Combat function in SVA package44 and (ii) quantile normalization with the preprocessCore package.45 We used self-organizing map (SOM) to group genes into nodes according to similar transcript levels obtained from the different substrate conditions. Self-organising maps were constructed with the R package kohonen.46 The genes showing similar transcription levels were sorted and grouped into nodes of SOMs. It was empirically found that about 35 genes in a single node of the SOM gave the best resolution of the gene clusters. In terms of the standard formula ‘X × sqrt (N)’ to calculate the number of map units, where N was the number of the rows/genes of the data, X was 1.5. The number of iterations (epochs) was 100 times more than the map units to minimize the mean distance between the weights of the neighbouring nodes. The default initialization, learning rate and radius were used. Hexagonal SOM models were constructed. The mean reads (>12 log2) of the nodes (grouped genes) with the replicates combined were calculated for each substrate.We integrated SOM with the protein secretome information analysed by peptide-LC-MS/MS, using SOM Harboring Informative Nodes with Gene Ontology.10,47,482.7. Transcription regulation of co-orthologous genesOne-to-one orthologous genes from P. cinnabarinus BRFM 137, P. coccineus BRFM 310 and P. sanguineus BRFM 1264 were retrieved using OrthoFinder v. 2.3.8.49 Heatmaps were created on the log2-fold change of transcript read counts in each growth condition when compared with growth on maltose after DESeq2 normalization using the ‘Heatmap’ function from the package ‘ComplexHeatmap’ v1.10.1 in R. Pairwise comparisons of gene expression based on Pearson correlation coefficients among all replicates was performed on CAZyme, peptidase, hydrophobin and SSP co-orthologs after read count normalization by DESeq2, batch effect removal and quantile normalization ‘cor’ function in R and visualized as heatmap with R package, ggplot2.3. Results and discussion3.1. Four Pycnoporus species share similar genomic features and CAZomesTo assess the genomic diversity in the genus Pycnoporus, the genome of P. coccineus BRFM 310 (herein named Pycco), P. sanguineus BRFM 1264 (Pycsa) and P. puniceus BRFM 1868 (Pycpun) were sequenced and compared with that of P. cinnabarinus BRFM 137 (herein named Pycci).9 The genome size of P. coccineus, P. sanguineus and P. puniceus, ranging from 30 to 36 Mb were in line with that of P. cinnabarinus (33.67 Mb) and WR relatives (Table 1; Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S1). We observed low amounts of repeat sequences (1.8–12.3%) and the absence of major rearrangements in the genomes (Supplementary Figs S2 and S3). The genes coding for mating type, Class II peroxidases, CAZymes, peptidases, GSTs, hydrophobins, proteins from the secretory pathway, the glycosylation pathway, the carbon catabolism pathway and SSPs were inspected by expert annotation (Supplementary Tables S2–S15 and Figs S4–S13). We observed a high proportion of conserved protein-coding genes across the genomes (82.3% of the P. cinnabarinus protein-coding genes) and a low proportion of species-specific genes (4–5%; Supplementary Fig. S14). Inspection of mating type genes showed high sequence identity between the alleles of the four Pycnoporus species (Supplementary Table S4). In particular, P. coccineus BRFM 310 and P. sanguineus BRFM 1264 alleles were much more similar to each other than to that of the two other Pycnoporus species, in support of the notion that these two species are closely related.15,50Features of P. coccineus BRFM 310, P. puniceus BRFM 1868 and P. sanguineus BRFM 1264 genome assemblies and annotationsThe reliability of gene structural annotations was assessed using universal single-copy orthologs (BUSCO).

The genome of P. cinnabarinus BRFM 1379 is indicated for comparison.The CAZyme gene repertoires (CAZome) in the three newly sequenced genomes were similar to that of P. cinnabarinus (mean 436 CAZymes classified into 108 CAZy families). The gene counts for FCW-degrading enzymes were similar to that of other Polyporales fungi (Supplementary Fig. S15). As a common feature of WR fungi,4,51Pycnoporus genomes contained a large number of genes coding for PCW-active CAZymes when compared with brown-rot fungi, which use Fenton chemistry in combination with a limited number of CAZymes for PCW breakdown (Fig. 1, Supplementary Figs S16–S18). The genomes were rich in lytic polysaccharide monooxygenases (LPMOs) active on crystalline cellulose and ß-(1,4)-linked hemicellulose polysaccharides (CAZy family AA9; 13–17 genes). The Class II PODs (in total 9–11 genes) were identified as manganese peroxidases (MnP), versatile peroxidases (VP) and lignin peroxidases (LiP; Supplementary Fig. S19 and Table S5). We observed a high number of predicted secreted oxidoreductases that could act as AA enzymes for the oxidative degradation of PCWs. Among them, GMC-oxidoreductases from CAZy subfamily AA3_2 (20–22 genes) have pivotal roles in PCW degradation. Secreted AA3_2 are involved in the generation of H2O2, a co-substrate for class II peroxidases and LPMOs. AA3_2 also contribute to the oxidation of saccharides and to the redox cycling of aromatic alcohols and quinones. In addition, we identified three AA5_1 glyoxal oxidase genes in each of the genomes, which encode copper radical oxidases involved in extracellular H2O2 production (Supplementary Figs S9–S13 and Table S6).

Enzymes active on FCWs, cellulose, hemicellulose or pectin were classified according to Supplementary Figs S15–S18.3.2. Pycnoporus species show diverse responses to lignocellulosic substratesTo assess the functional diversity within the genus Pycnoporus, we compared the ability of the phylogenetically most closely related species; P. cinnabarinus, P. coccineus and P. sanguineus to grow on a variety of plant-derived carbon sources on agar plate assays. In these conditions, we observed differences in fungal growth on complex lignocellulosic substrates (Fig. 2a and Supplementary Fig. S20). We next analysed the early response of the three species to cellulose, WS and woody substrates in agitated liquid culture media and compared their transcriptomes and the secreted proteins collected from the media. Maltose was used as a control, as it was shown not to induce carbon catabolic repression in ascomycetes.52 AVI was used as a cellulose-enriched substrate, and WS, pine and Asp were used as representatives of Gramineae, softwood and hardwood, respectively. At day 3, most cultures had initiated growth and consumed all maltose initially present in the medium. This time-point was therefore selected to analyse the early response of each species to the substrates (Fig. 3; Supplementary Figs S21 and S22).

Especially, P. coccineus showed the highest proportion of regulated genes with up to 7.6% of the genes up-regulated on pine (fold change in transcript abundance =4; Fig. 2b). Similarity between the transcriptomes of the three species was assessed by analysing the differential expression of one-to-one orthologous genes (co-orthologs) after 3-day growth on cellulose, WS or Asp when compared with maltose. To identify co-orthologs, in silico-deduced proteomes of the three species were clustered into 13,836 orthogroups using OrthoFinder, of which 6,524 represented co-orthologs. Similar transcript regulations were frequent between co-orthologs of two species. Surprisingly, however, we observed poor conservation of transcript regulation of co-orthologs across the three species, including for genes with high transcription induction or repression on particular carbon sources (Fig. 4a). We examined the transcript read counts of CAZyme-coding genes. Transcriptome profiles were more similar within the species cultured under the different conditions than between the species cultured on the same substrates (Supplementary Fig. S23). Also, we observed in each species that approximately half of the regulated CAZymes (41–51%) were up-regulated in response to cellulose, WS and Asp, highlighting the presence of core regulations to (ligno)cellulosic substrates with diverse compositions (Supplementary Fig. S24).

Conserved gene regulations in response to lignocellulosic substratesIn search for conserved enzymatic mechanisms involved in the initiation of lignocellulose breakdown, we analysed the gene sets sharing similar transcription profiles at the onset of the response to cellulose, WS or Asp. We focused on genes coding for proteins typically found in fungal exo-proteomes, i.e. CAZymes, peptidases, SSPs and hydrophobins.53 A total of 2,227 manually curated genes from the genomes of P. cinnabarinus, P. coccineus and P. sanguineus were analysed. In order to combine all RNA-seq data in a single cross-species analysis, transcript read counts were normalized using the DESeq2 package,43 the normalized read counts were log2 transformed and subjected to removal of batch effects and to quantile normalization. We checked the impact of each normalization step on the distribution of the data (Supplementary Figs S25–S28). Inspecting the one-to-one co-orthologs from this set of genes (405 orthology groups), we observed low conservation of the normalized transcript read counts across the species, except for growth on maltose and cellulose, and for P. coccineus and P. sanguineus grown on Asp, indicating that complex lignocellulosic substrates induced more diverse responses across the species (Fig. 4b).We grouped genes with similar transcript profiles into nodes (clusters of co-regulated genes) using the SOM unsupervised learning method. SOM is a data-driven clustering method constructing a topographic organization of nodes in which neighbouring nodes share similar transcriptome patterns, and thereby alleviates the requirement for arbitrary clustering thresholds. SOM allows the co-localization on the SOM map of genes with similar transcript levels. We used SOM on the normalized read counts from the three species in order to identify both the co-regulated genes within each species and the genes with similar transcript patterns across the species. We produced 72 nodes containing on average 31 genes per node (Fig. 5a and b). Exo-proteome data (Supplementary Tables S16–S18) were combined to the SOM map to integrate gene transcription and protein secretion information.

(c) Gene content and transcript profiles of nodes 57, 39 and 58. AA8-AA3-1: cellobiose dehydrogenase.We first examined the transcriptional response to cellulose. We identified 19 nodes containing 250 genes highly transcribed (mean normalized log2 read count =12) or up-regulated (mean fold change =4 compared with maltose; Supplementary Table S19). Inspecting the gene content for these nodes (e.g. Fig. 5c), we looked for shared gene differential expression across the three species. In the three species, we found up-regulation for CAZyme-coding genes involved in ß-(1,4)-glucan linkage breakdown including endoglucanases from family 5 subfamily 5 (GH5_5), GH45 and GH131, cellobiohydrolases (GH6, GH7), cellobiose dehydrogenases (CDH) and AA9 LPMOs (Fig. 6a). Also, there was a wide panel of enzymes active on hemicelluloses from families GH10, GH74, GH5_7, GH12, GH115, CE1, CE15, CE16, enzymes active on pectin CE8, GH28 and enzymes with promiscuous activities on glycosidic bounds GH1 and GH3. Among the 20 CAZyme families identified, 14 were represented by co-orthologous genes from the 3 species, showing conservation of their regulation in response to cellulose across the genus. Globally, 50% of the enzymes encoded by the up-regulated genes were detected in the culture medium (Fig. 6a), strengthening a role for these enzymes as key players in lignocellulose breakdown by Pycnoporus fungi.

(b) Numbers of genes with shared specific differential expression on lignocellulosic substrates, not on cellulose. The numbers of orthologous groups of genes with conserved transcription regulation and secretion across the three species are indicated.To identify the genes specifically regulated for the complex lignocellulosic substrates, we selected genes up-regulated on WS or Asp, not on cellulose, when compared with maltose. There were 13 nodes including 225 genes that met at least one of the following criteria; (i) average normalized log2 read counts >12 on WS or Asp and <12 on maltose and cellulose, or (ii) mean fold change =4 on WS or Asp, and =4 on cellulose when compared with maltose. From these nodes, we identified the gene families with homologs among the three species. These included genes coding for enzymes that target hemicelluloses (CE16 and CE4 acetylesterases, GH2 ß-mannosidases or ß-glucuronidases, GH16 xyloglucan hydrolase, GH27 a-galactosidases, GH30 ß-glucosidase/ß-xylosidase, GH51 a-l-arabinofuranosidases and GH31 a-xylosidases/a-glucosidases), enzymes that target pectin (GH28 polygalacturonases, PL14_4 ß-1,4-glucuronan lyases), AA1_1 laccases and AA3_2 GMC-oxidoreductases (Fig. 6b, Supplementary Table S20). Genes coding for glycoside hydrolases active on the FCW (GH18 chitinases, GH76 a-mannanases) and peptidases were also specifically up-regulated in the three species.The genomes of the three species encoded the three types of class II peroxidases involved in lignin breakdown; MnP, LiP and VP (Supplementary Table S5). Orthologous MnP and LiP genes (defined by protein sequence phylogeny; Supplementary Fig. S6) did not show conserved regulation across the species in response to lignocellulosic substrates (Fig. 7). The highest induction factors were found in P. coccineus and a MnP (protein ID #1468611)- and a LiP (#1431101)-coding gene reached 800- and 1,500-fold induction on Asp, respectively. For the three species, we observed no up-regulation of the VP-coding genes. Regulation of Class II peroxidase genes in response to the substrates.

Orthologous genes are grouped for comparison of their transcription profiles.3.4. Co-regulated genes indicative of enzymatic synergiesWe investigated potential enzymatic synergies conserved in the three Pycnoporus species through co-regulated gene transcription with co-secreted corresponding proteins. In each species, one single CDH gene was present in the genome, which shared a similar transcription pattern with AA9 LPMO-coding genes (nodes 39, 57 and 58; Figs 5c and 8). These AA9 LPMO and CDH genes were up-regulated on cellulose and the corresponding proteins were identified in the exo-proteomes. AA9 LPMOs oxidatively cleave glycosidic chains at the cellulose surface thereby creating new substrate-binding sites for hydrolytic cellulases.54 CDHs are composed of a flavin adenine dinucleotide-binding dehydrogenase domain (AA3_1) connected via a flexible linker to a haem b-binding cytochrome domain55 (Cytb; AA8). In vitro, CDHs behave as electron donors for AA9 LPMOs and boost LPMO activity (reviewed in Berrin et al.56). Our results suggest CDH as a biologically relevant electron donor for AA9 LPMOs.

Transcript levels are expressed as log2-transformed read counts after 3-day-growth on maltose (M), AVI, WS or Asp. CBM: carbohydrate-binding module. As indicated above, genes coding for predicted class II peroxidases (AA2s) were specifically up-regulated on WS or Asp, but not on cellulose (Fig. 5b). Node 40, 41 and 32 contained three mnp genes from P. coccineus co-regulated with the three predicted glyoxal oxidase genes identified in this genome, suggesting that glyoxal oxidases might provide these MnPs with the H2O2 required for their activity (Fig. 6). In contrast in P. cinnabarinus and P. sanguineus, we did not observe any co-regulations at the transcript level between class II peroxidases and glyoxal oxidases.3.5. Differentially regulated genes indicative of detoxificationIn natural environments, lignocellulose degradation may lead to the release of toxic degradation products and extractives (e.g. phenols, terpenoids and tannins).57,58 We investigated if the regulation of genes involved in detoxification was conserved across the three Pycnoporus species in our growth conditions. For this purpose, we examined genes coding for putative GST in the cross-species SOM analysis.We identified a GST gene from class GTT2 in P. sanguineus that was clustered in node 31 filtered for high transcript level on WS and Asp, and one GTT2 gene from P. cinnabarinus that was clustered in node 22 filtered for up-regulation on WS (Supplementary Table S20). One isoform of this class from Phanerochaete chrysosporium has been functionally characterized and has been shown to reduce high-molecular weight peroxides.59,60 In contrast, a total of four GST genes of P. coccineus were regulated on the tested substrates; two GST class A (FuA) genes were up-regulated on all the tested substrates (Supplementary Table S19) whereas one S-glutathionyl hydroquinone reductase and one GST Omega were specifically up-regulated in response to WS or Asp (Supplementary Table S20). For the case of P. chrysosporium, these classes of GSTs have potential roles in the detoxification of wood-derived molecules acting as ligandins for wood extractives or as catalysts for deglutathionylation of various substrates, including hydroquinone conjugates and terpenes.36,59,61 These findings suggest that different GST-related detoxification systems may exist in P. coccineus.Cytochrome P450 (CYP450) monooxygenases are commonly involved in the first step of eliminating toxic molecules including molecules released from lignocellulose. CYP450 can initiate the modification of these molecules via hydroxylation, epoxidation or monooxygenation.62,63 The genomes of P. cinnabarinus, P. coccineus and P. sanguineus contain 107, 132 and 113 predicted CYP450, respectively. Inspection of the transcript profiles for these genes showed that P. coccineus had the highest number of up-regulated CYP450 genes in response to the tested substrates (17 genes) compared with P. cinnabarinus and P. sanguineus (14 and 6 up-regulated genes, respectively). Some CYP450 genes were commonly up-regulated in at least two species, which were from families CYP63, CYP5035, CYP5139, CYP5144 and CYP5150 According to the Fungal cytochrome P450 database64 (Supplementary Table S13). Of these, CYP63, CYP5139 and CYP5144 were shown to be active on multiple xenobiotic compounds such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, alkylphenols and alkanes.63,65,66 CYP5035s oxidize plant chemicals (i.e. resin and flavonoids), and the number of genes for CYP5035 and CYP5150 expanded in basidiomycetes that grow on wood or litter.63 Our results suggest that these CYP450 families could be differently utilized by the species for detoxification of molecules released from the lignocellulosic substrates.4. Discussion4.1. Phenotype diversity outreaches diversity of the predicted proteome across the genus PycnoporusThe four Pycnoporus species studied here are found in different geo-climatic areas15,16 covering the Northern hemisphere (P. cinnabarinus), countries bordering the Indian and Pacific Oceans (P. coccineus), the tropics and subtropics of both hemispheres (P. sanguineus) and paleotropical areas (P. puniceus), with overlap limited to Japan and Eastern China. Accordingly, the parental strains of the monokaryons studied here were collected in Europe, China, South America and Indonesia, respectively. Here, we show that the genomes sequenced from geographically distant strains did not show any major rearrangements in structure and protein-coding gene composition. Our findings suggest that geographical isolation of the species the genus Pycnoporus has not yet lead to any noticeable genome level diversity. In addition, the high sequence identity between mating type genes of the four species, particularly between P. coccineus and P. sanguineus suggests that the speciation events are recent in this genus. In the genus Laetiporus, another group of wood-decay fungi from the order Polyporales that originated about 20 mya,67 several regional speciation events have been estimated between 9.88 and 2.89 mya. Some of these speciation events have been related to vicariance that emerged due to tectonic activity and the disconnection of the continental plates or from wind and ocean current dispersion of basidiospores.67 It is currently estimated that the genus Pycnoporus originated about 40–50 mya (Nagy LG, personal communication). Further molecular studies are needed to understand the dispersal routes and the role of regional speciation in the evolutionary history of Pycnoporus.Despite conserved CAZomes, the P. cinnabarinus, P. coccineus and P. sanguineus strains analysed here showed different abilities to grow on (ligno)cellulosic substrates. This finding demonstrates that gene repertoires obtained from genome sequencing are not sufficient to predict the ability of a strain to grow on recalcitrant raw biomass. The comparison of the early responses of the fungi to the substrates showed that gene transcription profiles better correlated with the strains rather than with the substrates. A similar trend was observed in the WR fungus Pleurotus ostreatus, between monokaryotic strains issued from a same parental dikaryotic strain. In P. ostreatus, these differences in gene regulation have been partly attributed to the presence of transposable elements near the differentially regulated genes.68 A closer analysis of transposable element localization or methylation status of each monokaryon haplotype would help understanding the transcription regulation we observed.4.2. Conserved sets of enzymes produced at the onset of wood-decay activityAs a conserved response to cellulose across three Pycnoporus species, we identified here a set of CAZyme genes with shared transcriptional regulations. For a sub-set of these genes, the corresponding enzymes were commonly found in the secretomes of the three species at the analysed time point, further strengthening a role for these enzymes as key players in lignocellulose breakdown by these fungi. These included genes coding for enzymes active on ß-1,4-glucan linkages (GH5_5 and GH131 endo-ß-1,4-glucanases, GH6 and GH7 cellobiohydrolases and AA9 LPMOs) and genes targeting the hemicellulose backbone (GH10 endoxylanases, GH12 and GH74 xyloglucan hydrolases, GH5_7 ß-mannosidases) or branched groups (CE1 feruloyl esterases) and enzymes active on pectin (GH28 polygalacturonases). In the presence of lignocellulosic substrates, additional genes were commonly induced and the corresponding CAZymes secreted, that target hemicelluloses (GH16 xyloglucan hydrolase, GH27 ß-galactosidases, GH30 ß-glucosidases/ß-xylosidases, GH51 a-l-arabinofuranosidases), peptidases and laccases (AA1_1).4.3. AA9 LPMOs and their enzymatic partnersAA9 LPMOs are known as key players in oxidative cellulose depolymerization by wood-decay fungi.56 Expansions in AA9 gene numbers is a common feature of the genomes of WR fungi,69 but whether members of the AA9 gene family play different roles during wood decay has not been elucidated. We identified 17, 16 and 11 genes coding for AA9 LPMOs in P. cinnabarinus, P. coccineus and P. sanguineus, from which 11 (64%), 13 (81%) and 10 (90%), respectively, were up-regulated during the early response to cellulose-containing substrates. In each strain, several AA9 LPMO genes shared similar transcription profiles, and several AA9 LPMOs were concomitantly secreted, indicating that several AA9 LPMOs co-secreted by the fungi might act simultaneously on the substrate.The identification of enzymatic partners for LPMOs is a very active field of research.70–73 Looking at conserved co-regulations across the three strains, we identified CDHs as invariably co-regulated with at least one AA9 LPMO gene. CDHs have been shown to reduce O2 and generate H2O2 which in turn can fuel, via the Fenton reaction, the production of hydroxyl radicals that disrupt lignocellulose polymers.74 More recently, CDHs have been shown to activate AA9 LPMOs in vitro through electron transfer75 and it has been proposed that CDHs could also activate AA9 LPMOs through the generation of H2O2, a co-substrate for the enzyme.76 Our findings support the hypothesis of synergy between AA9 LPMOs and CDHs in vivo as a conserved mechanism for cellulose degradation in the genus Pycnoporus spp.4.4. Co-secretion of extracellular H2O2-generating and -consuming enzymesExtracellular H2O2 is a central factor in oxidative lignocellulose breakdown. It was proposed that WR fungi could avoid oxidative damages due to H2O2 accumulation in the vicinity of the hyphae by the co-secretion of H2O2-generating and H2O2-consuming enzymatic partners.72 Some secreted GMC-oxidoreductases such as glucose dehydrogenases and aryl-alcohol quinone oxidoreductases (AA3_2), which generate H2O2, are able to prime AA9 LPMO activity in vitro.70,73 Similarly, glyoxal oxidases can generate H2O2 and prime MnP and LiP activity in vitro.77 A biological relevance for these synergetic activities was previously suggested from the co-occurrence in fungal secretomes of class II peroxidases with GMC-oxidoreductases10,51,78–82 or glyoxal oxidases.10,51,79,81,83–85 Here, we confirmed the co-occurrence in the secretomes of GMC-oxidoreductases and glyoxal oxidases with class II peroxidases and AA9 LPMOs as a common feature of three Pycnoporus species. However, we detected no evidence for co-regulation of the corresponding genes at the transcript level, except between three MnPs and two glyoxal oxidase encoding genes in P. coccineus. We hypothesize that independent tight regulations of gene expression for H2O2-generating and H2O2-consuming enzymes at the transcription level could allow a more flexible system to rapidly adapt extracellular reactive oxygen species concentrations and avoid oxidative damage to the hyphae.5. ConclusionAlthough WR fungi are well-studied for the diversity of enzymatic systems for lignocellulose breakdown, their intra-genus diversity has not been extensively explored so far. Here, we investigated the functional diversity within the genus Pycnoporus, a group of fungi from the Trametes clade renowned for the ecological significance and a great potential for novel biocatalysts. We introduced a new method for cross-species comparisons of transcriptomes, using the genome sequences of the four species described in the genus and expert gene functional annotations. The transcriptomic aspect of observations was validated with experimentally identified secreted proteins, supporting our hypotheses. We identified a conserved set of genes responsive to lignocellulosic substrates that outlines key enzymatic mechanics for wood decomposition activity in these fungi. We observed that the mechanisms involved in oxidative lignin breakdown were more diverse than those in polysaccharide breakdown and the fungal enzymes detoxifying lignocellulose-released products were different among the species.We are grateful to Valentin Loux from the INRA MIGALE bioinformatics platform (http://migale.jouy.inra.fr) and to Estelle Bonnin (INRA, France) for substrate composition analysis.

The sequence data thus established revealed the presence of structural variations and rearrangements in the Brassicaceae genomes. A total of 89,915 genes were identified in the ‘Okute-Sakurajima’ genome, 30,033 of which were newly found in this study. The genome information reported here will not only contribute to the establishment of a new resource for the radish genomics but also provide insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying formation of the giant root.1. IntroductionDaikon, or Japanese radish (Raphanus sativus), belongs to Brassicaceae with its root varying considerably in size and shape among different cultivars.1 ‘Sakurajima daikon’ is the name given to a group of the radish varieties developed and cultivated mainly in Kagoshima prefecture of Japan. The soil in the region of its cultivation contains volcanic ashes originated from Mt. Sakurajima which are said to be particularly suited for cultivating ‘Sakurajima daikon’. One well-known ‘Sakurajima daikon’ cultivar is named ‘Okute-Sakurajima’, which has a large round root often exceeding 20 kg in weight.1 The size and shape of ‘Okute-Sakurajima’ root are attractive traits in plant breeding, but the molecular mechanisms underpinning these characteristics remain largely unestablished. Four genome assemblies based on next-generation sequencing technologies have been reported for radish,2–5 but they do not include ‘Sakurajima daikon’, in particular ‘Okute-Sakurajima’. The sequence contiguities of the genome assemblies in these reports are relatively short and do not cover the entire radish genome.6 One reason for the short sequences in the assembly may be due to the complexity of the radish genome, because species belonging to Raphanus, like those in the genus Brassica, underwent genome triplication at a certain point after divergence from an ancestor common to Arabidopsis.7 Furthermore, together with other Brassica species, radish is self-incompatible and allogamous, resulting in a highly heterozygous genome.8Recent advances in long-read sequence technology have enabled us to obtain the genomic sequence data of highly heterozygous plant species.9 In this study, we attempted to sequence the ‘Okute-Sakurajima’ genome using the long-read sequencing technology and the sequences thus obtained were aligned to a high-density SNP genetic map to produce chromosome-scale pseudomolecule sequences. This has substantially improved the previous radish genome assemblies that contained gaps. The resultant radish genome data of better quality will provide clues as to its evolutionary history, in particular with regard to the molecular events that resulted in giant root formation.2. Materials and methods2.1. De novo assembly of the ‘Okute-Sakurajima’ genomeTotal DNA was extracted from young leaves of the ‘Okute-Sakurajima’ radish cultivar (NARO GeneBank accession number: JP27228) using a Genomic-tip kit of Qiagen (Hilden, Germany). Short-read sequence data were obtained using a MIGSEQ-2000 DNA sequencer (also known as a DNBSEQ-G400; MGI Tech, Shenzhen, China) and were used to estimate the genome size after removing adaptor sequences (AAGTCGGAGGCCAAGCGGTCTTAGGAAGACAA and AAGTCGGATCGTAGCCATGTCGTTCTGTGAGCCAAGGAGTTG) and reads from organelle genomes (GenBank accession numbers: NC_018551 and NC_024469). Subsequently, k-mer distribution analysis was performed using Jellyfish. To obtain long-read sequence data, an SMRT sequence library was constructed with an SMRTbell Express Template Prep Kit (PacBio, Menlo Park, CA, USA) and used to sequence on a PacBio Sequel system (PacBio). The long-read sequences thus obtained were assembled, and the two haplotype sequences of the diploid genome were resolved with Falcon-unzip. Errors in the resultant assembled data were corrected twice with arrow to obtain the final assembly designated as RSAskr_r1.0. The completeness evaluation of the assembly was performed with BUSCO (embryophyta odb9). The software tools used for genome assembly are shown in Supplementary Table S1.2.2. Construction of pseudomolecules based on the genetic mapAn F2 mapping population (n = 115), termed SNF2, was derived from a cross between an inbred line via self-pollination of radish cultivar ‘Shogoin Daikon’ and a line of R. sativus var. raphanistroides ‘Nohara 1’ which was collected from Nohara, Maizuru, Kyoto, Japan, and was used to establish genetic maps according to the methods of Shirasawa and Kitashiba.6 In brief, DNA was extracted from leaves of each line and used for ddRAD-Seq library construction. The library was sequenced on a HiSeq4000 sequencer (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and the data obtained were analysed as described by Shirasawa and Kitashiba.6 After discarding low-quality sequences and adapter sequences using FASTX-Toolkit and PRINSEQ, the resultant high-quality reads were mapped onto the RSAskr_r1.0 assembly, using Bowtie2 to call SNPs using the mpileup command in SAMtools followed by filtering out the low-quality data with VCFtools. In parallel, ddRAD-Seq data (DRA accession number: DRA005069) from another F2 population (n = 95) named ASF2,2 which was derived from a cross between ‘Aokubi S-h’ and ‘Sayatori 26704’, were also analysed as described above. SNP data were used for genetic map construction with Lep-Map3. The RSAskr_r1.0 sequence assembly was assigned to the genetic maps with ALLMAPS to establish pseudomolecule sequences representing the radish chromosome-scale sequences, termed RSAskr_r1.0.pmol. The structure of the ‘Okute-Sakurajima’ genome was compared with those of R. sativus,4,Brassica rapa,10 and Arabidopsis thaliana11 using D-Genies.2.3. Identification of genes and repeats in the genome sequencesAb initio gene prediction was performed with the RSAskr_r1.0.pmol sequences using Augustus and intrinsic (with start and stop codons) and partial (without start and/or stop codons) genes were selected to exclude transposable elements, pseudogenes (with in-frame stop codons), and short genes (encoding <50 amino acids) as described by Kitashiba et al.2 The genes predicted in the RSA_r1.0 assembly2 and de novo transcriptome assembled from 73.7 Gb public RNA-Seq reads (Sequence Read Archive accession numbers: SRA072125, SRA080301, SRA140538, SRA306323, SRA401451, and SRA498899) with Trinity were mapped onto the RSAskr_r1.0.pmol pseudomolecules using Minimap2. Repetitive sequences in the RSAskr_r1.0.pmol were identified with RepeatMasker, for which repeat sequences registered in Repbase and a de novo repeat library built with RepeatScout, were used. The repeat elements were classed in nine types; short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), long terminal repeats (LTR) elements, DNA elements, unclassifed, satellintes, simple repeats, and low complexity in accordance with RepeatMasker.3. Results and data description3.1. De novo assembly of the ‘Okute-Sakurajima’ genomeK-mer distribution analysis of the 99.3-Gb high-quality short-read data indicated that the ‘Okute-Sakurajima’ genome was highly heterozygous, and that the estimated haploid genome size was 498.5 Mb (Fig. 1). Subsequent long-read sequencing produced 36.0 Gb data (60.7× coverage of the estimated genome size) in 2.3 million reads with N50 length of 29.1 kb. After two rounds of data polishing, the long-read assembly consisting of 504.5 Mb primary contigs (including 1,437 sequences with N50 length of 1.2 Mb) and 263.5 Mb alternative contigs comprised of the other haplotypes with different alleles, also known as haplotig sequences (including 2,373 sequences with N50 length of 154.6 kb) (Table 1) were obtained. A BUSCO analysis of the primary contigs indicated that 71.0% and 23.1% of sequences were single-copy complete BUSCOs and duplicated complete BUSCOs, respectively (Table 1), suggesting that most of the genes were present in the primary contigs.Genome size estimation for ‘Okute-Sakurajima’ with the distribution of the number of distinct k-mers (k = 17) with the given multiplicity values.Genome size estimation for ‘Okute-Sakurajima’ with the distribution of the number of distinct k-mers (k = 17) with the given multiplicity values.Statistics of the primary contig sequences of ‘Okute-Sakurajima’Statistics of the primary contig sequences of ‘Okute-Sakurajima’3.2. Construction of pseudomolecules based on the genetic mapFrom the sequence data thus obtained, we were able to identify 5,872 and 2,830, respectively, of high-quality SNPs in the SNF2 and ASF2 mapping populations and used them for linkage analysis. The resultant genetic map for SNF2 consisted of nine linkage groups with 5,570 SNPs covering 867.2 cM, and the map for ASF2 comprised nine linkage groups with 2,680 SNPs covering 895.3 cM (Table 2). The contig sequences of RSAskr_r1.0 were assigned to the radish chromosomes in accordance with the two genetic maps mentioned above. Sequences of the nine pseudomolecules, termed RSAskr_r1.0.pmol, were found to span 349.8 Mb (69.3%) of 293 contigs (Table 3), of which 95 sequences (218.5 Mb, 43.3%) were properly oriented. The resultant nine sequences were named Rs1 through Rs9 according to the nomenclature proposed by Shirasawa and Kitashiba.6 The remaining unassigned sequences (n = 1,144, 154.7 Mb, 30.7%) were tentatively grouped into Rs0. The structure of the ‘Okute-Sakurajima’ genome thus established was found to be conserved within R. sativus, but partially deviated from the B. rapa and A. thaliana genomes as indicated previously2 (Fig. 2).

Genes and repetitive sequences in the ‘Okute-Sakurajima’ genomeWe predicted a total of 89,915 likely genes including transposable elements, pseudogenes, and short genes in the current assembly RSAskr_r1.0.pmol using an ab initio gene prediction (Table 3 and Fig. 3), which is the same method in our previous study.2 Out of them, 65,616 genes were found to be intrinsic and/or partial genes and 73,724 were supported by transcriptome data that complete BUSCO score was 97.0%. In total, 56,773 genes were intrinsic and/or partial genes supported by transcriptome data. In parallel, 80,521 genes predicted in our previous assembly, RSA_r1.0,2 were aligned to RSAskr_r1.0.pmol to find 78,645 genes aligned on the pseudomolecules. As a result of the prediction and mapping analyses, genomic locations of 59,882 (including 42,019 transcriptome-supported intrinsic and/or partial genes) of the 89,915 predicted genes in RSAskr_r1.0 were found to overlap 77,496 of the 78,645 individual mapped genes in RSA_r1.0. The remaining 30,033 genes (=89,915 - 59,882) including 14,754 transcriptome-supported intrinsic and/or partial genes were found to exist only in the assembled sequences of ‘Okute-Sakurajima’.Numbers of genes predicted with the same method from the two radish genome sequences, RSAskr_r1.0 and RSA_r1.0.Numbers of genes predicted with the same method from the two radish genome sequences, RSAskr_r1.0 and RSA_r1.0.Repetitive sequences occupied a total of 256.0 Mb (50.7%) of the RSAskr_r1.0.pmol (504.5 Mb). The repeats were consisting of nine major types with the different proportion (Table 4). Although the maximum lengths of each type were ranging from 0.9 to 100 kb (Fig. 4), the lengths of most elements were shorter than the read N50 of 29.1 kb. The genome distribution patterns were different depending on the types (Fig. 5). Out of them, the pattern of LTRs showed opposite to that of the intrinsic genes. Interestingly, the eight regions lacked in the previous study were enriched with LTRs but possessed genes as well.Distribution of repeat element lengths.

Conclusion and future perspectiveIn this study, we analysed the genome sequence of a radish cultivar named ‘Okute-Sakurajima’, a variety of ‘Sakurajima-diakon’, based on the long-read sequence technology. Advantages in this technology provided benefits to the radish genome assembly. The total assembly size of 504.5 Mb, which was roughly equal to the estimated size of 498.5 Mb, is the longest reported to date2–5 for any radish genome, suggesting that the long reads with the N50 length of 29.1 kb have obviously spanned the regions containing repetitive sequences in the radish genome (Fig. 4) and thus their presence did not hinder sequence assembly. The assembly contiguity represented by contig N50 in this study was remarkably longer than those in previous studies.2–5 Complete BUSCO score reached as high as 94.1%, among which 23.1% was duplicated BUSCOs. This was probably due to the evolutionary history of the genome triplication in this mesopolyploid species.7Map-based pseudomolecules were produced which comprised 69.3% of the assembled sequences. Unexpectedly, however, we were unable to assign 30.7% of the sequences into pseudomolecules. This was largely because sequences without any SNPs are in general difficult to assemble as our genetic map construction relied on the presence of SNPs. To overcome this limitation, optical mapping and Hi-C technologies, both of which are based on physical mapping, have been developed.9 These technologies, when combined with traditional genetic mapping, would allow an improved genome coverage of the assembly into pseudomolecules.In conclusion, through sequencing of the ‘Okute-Sakurajima’ genome, we have identified 89,915 genes, of which 56,773 (63.1%) were transcriptome-supported intrinsic and/or partial genes (Fig. 3). Among them, 30,033 genes (including 14,754 transcriptome-supported intrinsic and/or partial genes, 49.1%) were newly found in this study, while 59,882 genes (42,019 transcriptome-supported intrinsic and/or partial genes, 70.2%) were presented in the previous assembly.2 The genomic information thus expanded is expected to provide new insights into radish growth and development. Further detailed analysis in comparison with other radish cultivars will perhaps contribute to the establishment of the relevant genetic mechanisms for giant root formation as well as other useful characteristics of radish cultivars.We thank S.

IntroductionSexuality is a fundamental mechanism that acts for the maintenance of genetic diversity within a species. In contrast to animals, hermaphroditism is thought to be ancestral and most common in flowering plants. A minority of species have subsequently, and independently, evolved separated sexuality, with separate male and female individuals (dioecy).1,2 These species represent up to 5% of angiosperm species.3,4 Plant biologists have thrived to understand the evolutionary steps associated with transitions into or out of dioecy since the first findings of genetic sex determination in flowering plants.5 Typical transitions out of dioecy have been associated with domestication events in some crops. For example, in papaya6 or grape,7 the loss of function of the Y chromosome-encoded female suppressor genes, resulting in hermaphroditism, was artificially selected, presumably for stable cultivation. On the other hand, polyploidization is also thought to be a main key player in the evolution of sexuality, often causing a transition out of dioecy.8,9In dioecious diploid persimmon species (Diospyros spp.), the Y chromosome-encoded small-RNA gene OGI is responsible for expression of maleness, through the repression of its autosomal counterpart, a gene called MeGI.10 Importantly, hexaploid cultivated Oriental persimmon (Diospyros kaki) has evolved a more plastic sex determination system from the dioecious system, possibly through epigenetic regulation of OGI and MeGI.11,12 In hexaploid Oriental persimmon, genetically male individuals, carrying at least one copy of Y-chromosome (including OGI), exhibit monoecy, where both male and female flowers are produced by the same tree, although they often produce only female flowers.13 This monoecious system is based on the semi-inactivation of OGI by the presence of a highly methylated retrotransposon insertion, named Kali, within the OGI promoter region, and on the variable DNA methylation of the MeGI sequence (Fig. 1A).11 With the exception of a few genetically female cultivars, which do not carry the OGI sequence but occasionally bear male flowers,13,14 this male production is consistent with the change of epigenetic regulation on MeGI.15 Therefore, the OGI/MeGI system is thought to be conserved as the regulator of sex determination in hexaploid persimmon as in diploid persimmon, despite the fact that expression of OGI in hexaploid persimmon has never been formally observed, possibly because it is extremely restricted both temporally and spatially. Approaches used to identify the genetic factors regulating OGI activity. (A) Model of the male flower formation in monoecious hexaploidy D. kaki individuals. OGI is inactivated by the presence of a highly methylated SINE-like retrotransposon in the promoter region.11,OGI is occasionally expressed and triggers small-RNA production by MeGI. The resulting DNA methylation in the promoter region represses MeGI expression to switch to the production of male flowers. After production of the initial male flowers, the fate of flower sexuality depends on maintenance or release of DNA methylation on MeGI.11 (B) Two genotyping approaches are available for polyploid populations, that tailor to two different models for the effect of genetic inheritance: (i) in the additive model, heterozygous alleles are further characterized based on their copy number, (ii) in the diploidized additive model, only diploidized genotypes are considered (homozygous or heterozygous), irrespective of the ratio of alleles in the heterozygous states.Approaches used to identify the genetic factors regulating OGI activity.

Typically, all floral buds produced on a branch develop similarly, either into male or female flowers. The first flowering year, all branches bear female flowers. In subsequent years, female branches tend to produce female branches but there is a low frequency of transition from female to male. Once a branch is male, it typically produces male branches in subsequent years, but there is a low frequency of reversal to femaleness as well. These observations are consistent with the hypothesis that occasional activation of OGI expression results in the accumulation of small-RNA and -DNA methylation on MeGI, leading to the production of male flowers. Subsequently, maintenance of maleness is dependent on the maintenance of the DNA methylation status of MeGI.11 According to this hypothesis, the frequency of OGI activation should be directly associated with male conversion. Here, we used segregating sibling plants that carry the OGI gene to investigate the genetic factors that regulate male conversion in hexaploid Oriental persimmon.Investigating the genetic architecture of traits with multiple alleles and mixed inheritance patterns in polyploid species is challenging.16 Genotyping in polyploids is complicated by the possibility of more than two alleles at each locus, and the existence of different heterozygous states. For instance, in the case of autohexaploid persimmon with hexasomic inheritance,17 we can define five heterozygous states; AAAAAa (5:1), AAAAaa (4:2), and AAAaaa (3:3) AAaaaa (2:4) to Aaaaaa (1:5). Quantitative genotyping of such loci using qPCR is a possible solution,17,18 but it is time-consuming. Recent advances in sequencing and genotyping technologies now allow calling high-density single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), and accurate determination of allele ratio and allele dosage for polyploid genomes. Genome-wide association analysis, using quantitative genotypes, coupled with realistic genetic models19,20 could shed light on the genetic basis of complex traits.In this study, to examine the genetic factors underlying female-to-male conversion in hexaploid Oriental persimmon, we collected high-density genotype information in a segregating population exhibiting biases in male flower ratio. Considering the nature of polysomic inheritance, we developed genome-wide correlation/association analyses for polyploid persimmon using two different models (Fig. 1B): (i) an additive model using quantitative genotypes in the form of allelic ratio, and (ii) a diploidized additive model using diploidized genotypes.21 The results led to the identification of genetic regions and candidate genes potentially involved in the regulation of female-to-male conversion, providing novel insights into the genetic basis of flexible sexuality after adaptation to polyploidization or domestication.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and selection of individuals carrying OGI allelesThe segregating F1 population produced from a cross between ‘Yamatogosho’ (6 A + XXXXXX) × ‘Taishu’ (6 A + XXXXYY), named the YTF1 population, was developed in 2009, and exhibited variation in the frequency of male production since the first flowering in 2013–14. Flower sexuality from a total of 5,016 non-male (female or no flower) parental branches was assessed for 5 years, from 2014 to 2018. A male conversion branch was defined as a non-male parental branch producing male flowers on at least one branch (Fig. 2A). Two phenotypes were recorded each year. ‘Ability of male conversion’, reflects the presence or absence of male flowers on any given branch. In other words, if any branch in a tree had switched to male that year, the tree was scored as 1 for this phenotype. If none of the branches had converted, it was scored as 0. The second phenotype, ‘Male conversion rate’, was calculated by dividing the number of branches that converted to male in a specific year, by the total number of non-male parental branches. Both phenotypes were scored each year. To identify the genetic factors regulating male conversion, a total 83 individuals, each carrying at least one OGI allele were selected. To identify individuals carrying the OGI genes, genomic DNA was extracted from leaves of each individual using the CTAB method,13 and OGI was amplified by PCR using two primer pairs (Supplementary Table S1), with a programme of 95°C for 3 min followed by 32 cycles of 95°C for 20 s, 56°C for 15 s, and 72°C for 1 min.

Genome-wide genotypingddRAD-sequencing libraries were prepared according to previous reports22 using 107 individuals of the YTF1 population and their two parents ‘Yamatogosho’ and ‘Taishu’. The libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq4000 platform, and generating PE100 reads at the Vincent J. Coates Genomics Sequencing Laboratory, University of California Berkeley. The reads were aligned to the reference genome of Diospyros lotus, a wild relative close to Oriental persimmon (http://persimmon.kazusa.or.jp/index.html)23 using the Burrows–Wheeler Aligner with default parameters [version 0.7.12 (https://github.com/lh3/bwa)24; Supplementary Table S2]. Based on these parameters, it is possible that some allelic and potential paralogous polymorphisms were occasionally derived from non-specific mapping. The resulting sam files were converted to bam files and subsequently vcf format using bcf/vcftools25 and Varscan.26 For genome-wide association/correlation analyses, only the 83 individuals carrying the OGI allele were used (Supplementary Table S2). Individual genotypes were only considered if coverage > 20. A total of 95,639 heterozygous markers were selected by using bcftools with the following options: minor allele frequency within the population > 0.05 and data were available for at least 50% of the individuals. For detection of transmission ratio distortion, only the 91 individuals of the YTF1 population with total coverage > 200 Mb were used, to decrease the possibility of detecting the false transmission distortion when using low coverage data (Supplementary Table S2). A total of 39,344 loci were selected, with average coverage between 60 and 200 for each of the 91 individuals, minimum coverage in the parents > 60, and by using bcftools with the following options: minor allele frequency > 0.01 and max-missing = 1. The coverage threshold was used to filter uniquely mapped sequences. Transmission distortion ratios of alternative alleles were calculated as the log value of [allele ratio in the YTF1/allele ratio in the parents]. Here, for the ‘allele ratio in the parents’ values, we calculated the alternative allelic read coverages in the two parents independently, and averaged them. Significant transmission distortion was detected by standardizing the transmission distortion ratios using z-transformation with the threshold of P-value < 1E-10.2.3. Heritability estimation2.4. Genome-wide correlation/association analyses using additive and diploidized additive modelsAllele composition (or quantitative genotype) at each SNP locus was estimated from the frequency of alternative alleles in mapped reads. Genome-wide correlation analysis was conducted using a total 40,111 of the 95,639 SNPs, in which duplex–pentaplex genotypes were predicted in at least 23/83 YTF1 individuals (<28% individuals with at least one recessive allele). To test if a locus affected male conversion in a dosage-dependent manner, Pearson product moment correlation analysis was conducted between the ratio of alternative alleles at each locus and the phenotype values of each individual. The coefficient values were standardized using z-transformation, to estimate P-values. Significant association loci were detected with the threshold of -log(P-value) > 5.60, representing a Bonferroni-corrected significance threshold of 0.1.Diploidized genotype at each locus was defined with the threshold of 5% (and 95%) of alternative alleles in the mapped reads to call heterozygosity. Genome-wide association analysis was conducted using the R package rrBLUP, with a linear mixed model (LMM).28 Significant association loci were detected with the threshold of -log(P-value) > 5.98, representing a Bonferroni-corrected significant threshold of 0.1. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) surrounding the loci highly associated with the sex expression (P < 10E-6) was evaluated using squared Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r2) with the -r2 command in the software PLINK version 1.07.2.5. Genome-wide analyses compensated with the effect of OGI allele dosageAllele dosage of OGI was estimated with quantitative PCR using LightCycler 480 (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany), according to a previous report13 (Supplementary Table S1 for primers). Briefly, using primer sets for OGI and the control locus, L5R, quantitative PCR analyses were conducted using THUNDERBIRD SYBR qPCR Mix (TOYOBO, Osaka, Japan). For six individuals of the YTF1 population, due to the lack of DNA, allele dosage on Chr. 15, the peak of 17,052,751-bp on the sex-chromosome was used as a proxy for OGI allele dosage (around 18.12-MB on Chr. 15).233. Results and discussion3.1. Characterization of flower sex expression in the YTF1 populationWithin the YTF1 population, 53 of 83 individuals only produced female flowers despite carrying at least one copy of the OGI gene (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Table S3). The monoecious individuals (N = 30) showed a wide range of male conversion rate, i.e. conversion from non-male (female and no flowers) parental branches producing male flowers within the 5 years assessment (Fig. 2A and C). As suggested in previous reports,13,29 the frequency of male flowers substantially increased as years went by, during the assessment (average male conversion rate are 0.07, 0.13, and 0.15 during the first 3 years; Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S3). Most of the male parental branches also produced male flowers in subsequent years (Supplementary Table S4), which was hypothetically due to maintenance of epigenetic marks (or DNA methylation) on MeGI in the parental branches.11 Consistent with these results, the estimated narrow-sense heritability for male conversion rate, across 5 years, was 0.28. Therefore, we assessed the cumulative ability to produce male branches from female branches throughout the 5 years, to compensate for the limited number of replicates, and reflect the effect of environmental inputs.3.2. No large-scale transmission distortion in the YTF1 populationPlants, which have recently polyploidized, often show unbalanced chromosome/genome compositions, such as frequent aneuploidy or unstable inheritance patterns,18,30,31 as also observed in hexaploid Oriental persimmon.17,32 The distribution of the alternative allele ratios per individual of the YTF1 population delineated seven peaks, putatively corresponding to nulliplex to hexaplex genotypes in each individual (Supplementary Fig. S2A). The distribution of mean alternative allele frequency in the YTF1 population as a whole and at each SNP loci, exhibited 13 potential peaks, putatively corresponding to 13 allelic combinations in an hexaploidy F1 cross (Supplementary Fig. S2B). We documented transmission ratio distortion throughout the genome, in the YTF1 population, but did not detect any large-scale distortion in allele ratio from the expected values based on the observed parental genotypes (Fig. 3). For example, our observed inheritance of OGI was consistent with mendelian heredity pattern of OGI in the progeny of a cross between a nulliplex and a duplex individual (<U+03C7>2 test P = 0.62). Although some SNP loci exhibited significant transmission distortion (P < 1E-11), other loci within the same haploblocks did not exhibit this distortion (Supplementary Table S5). We assumed that these loci were incorrectly genotyped due to ambiguity in parental genotyping with no replicates. Genome-wide transmission distortion of allelic ratios compared with the parental alleles. Dynamic (or fragmental) transmission ratio distortions were not detected. A value of ‘0’ for the log [F1/parents] (white line) is expected from complete lack of transmission distortion. Green lines indicated the threshold (P = 1E-10, see Section 2).Genome-wide transmission distortion of allelic ratios compared with the parental alleles.

Green lines indicated the threshold (P = 1E-10, see Section 2).3.3 The Y chromosome contributes to male conversion in a dosage-dependent mannerGenome-wide correlation analyses based on quantitative genotypes using an additive model resulted in several peaks, the strongest of which was located on the sex-chromosome (Chr. 15).23 This was true both for the ability of male conversion and the male conversion rate traits (Fig. 4A and B). Although the male-specific region of the Y-chromosome (MSY) is not included in the reference pseudomolecule (DLO_r1.0.pseudomolecule), it has been genetically anchored within Chr. 15 (around 18.12 Mb).23 Two highly associated peaks flanked the MSY that includes OGI (Fig. 4E and FSupplementary Table S6A and B). Some loci within the sex chromosome commonly showed significant correlation with the ability of male conversion and the male conversion rate (Fig. 4E and F), suggesting that these two traits were regulated by the same allele combinations. When using the diploidized additive model based on diploidized genotypes, the region surrounding the MSY showed a weak association to male conversion rate (Fig. 4C and D and Supplementary Table S6C). The location of the haploblock including MSY, based on diploidized genotypes (Fig. 4G), was consistent with the peaks based on quantitative genotypes (Fig. 4E and F).

(H) Correlation between allele ratio at the peak (17,052,751-bp) on the sex chromosome (Chr. 15, see E and F), and OGI allele dosage, as detected by qPCR. (I) Association between male conversion rate and the OGI allele dosage. The individuals carrying duplex OGI alleles exhibited significantly higher male conversion rates (t-test P-value shown).OGI allele numbers, as determined by quantitative PCR, were highly correlated with the numbers of alleles in the nearest peak produced using the additive model (r = 0.63, 78.2% of individuals exhibited identical quantitative genotypes, Fig. 4H and Supplementary Table S7), and with male conversion abilities (Fig. 4I;P = 0.003 for male conversion rate with Student t-test, Supplementary Table S8; P = 0.004 for ability of male conversion). Multiple regression tests with the loci quantitatively associated with male conversion abilities indicated that, amongst these loci, OGI exhibited the strongest effect (P < 0.0002, Supplementary Table S9). These results supported the idea that the OGI locus significantly contributes to male conversion ability in a dosage-dependent manner, and suggested that cis-elements within or close to OGI can play important roles for the activation of OGI. This concept is similar to the dosage sex-chromosome systems in Rumex and Humulus,33 where dioecious sex determination is dependent on X/autosome balance. In these systems, individuals with intermediate sexuality, bearing hermaphrodite flowers, also appear in association with irregular X/autosome ratios between 0.5 and 1.0.333.4. Identification of candidate loci activating OGIAfter compensating for the effect of OGI allele dosage (see Materials and methods, Section 2.5 for the details), the peaks on the sex chromosome, both with quantitative and diploidized genotypes, was significantly reduced (Fig. 5A–D). Although the trends were almost identical to those in the original analysis (Fig. 4A–D), some peaks, especially those associated with the male conversion rate (Fig. 5B and D), became sharper than in the original model. Some of the original putative peaks were also reduced after compensation for the OGI dosage effect, presumably because their genotypes were accidentally similar to those of OGI. Some of the major peaks, especially on Chr. 5, 8, and 9, were common to the two models (Fig. 5A–D). On the other hand, peaks on Chr. 1, 2, and 4 were specific to additive model (Fig. 5A and B). Here, we focussed on the common candidate loci on Chr. 5, 8, and 9. To understand the combination effect of OGI and these three loci, multiplex regression tests were performed between the male conversion rate and the quantitative/diploidized genotypes (Supplementary Table S10), resulting in r2 values of 0.611 and 0.548 for the quantitative and diploidized genotypes, respectively. Importantly, the accuracy of the regression was significantly increased in comparison to the test without compensation for the OGI allele dosage ( r2 = 0.561 and 0.492 for quantitative and diploidized genotypes, respectively, Supplementary Table S9B and C). These results highlight the importance of quantitative genotyping and compensation for allele dosage in GWASs in polyploids.

Genotypes (Homo: homozygous, Het: heterozygous) of the most significant loci on Chr. 5 (H), Chr. 8 (I), and Chr. 9 (J).Both the additive and diploidized additive models showed consistent associations between Chr. 5 and male conversion rate (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Fig. 5E, respectively). The haploblock including the peak summit was maintained over a 3 Mb region (ca 8.6–11.8 Mb), and contained 184 genes (Fig. 5E). For Chr. 8, the peak spanned the region between 3.8 and 8.8 Mb, included 433 genes (Fig. 5F), and was associated with male conversion rate in both the additive and diploidized additive models (Supplementary Fig. S4 and Fig. 5F, respectively). The quantitative genotypes for the peak summit of the Chr. 9 peak observed in the additive model (Chr9:1,287,557, Supplementary Fig. S5A) ranged from nulliplex to duplex (Supplementary Fig. S5C). The peak covered 4 Mb of the sub-telomeric region and contained 262 genes (Fig. 5G). For all three of these peaks identified from the diploidized additive model analysis, nulliplex individuals showed significantly higher male conversion rate than heterozygous individuals (Fig. 5H–J), suggesting that loss of that particular allele is associated with positive regulation of male conversion. This is consistent with the results from the additive model on Chr. 8, which indicated that fewer copies of the alternative alleles were positively correlated with male conversion rate as well (Supplementary Fig. S5B). The genotypes of the male parent ‘Taishu’ and the YTF1 individuals with high male conversion were consistent (recessive homozygosity) in the highest peak on Chr. 5 (Supplementary Table S11). On the other hand, the peaks of Chr. 8 and Chr. 9 showed inconsistent genotypes between the male parent ‘Taishu’ and the YTF1 individuals with high male conversion rate (Supplementary Table S11). These suggested that Chr. 5 might reflect the characteristics of ‘Taishu’ for male production (or OGI activation), whereas the other two loci might act for OGI activation independently.Significant LD was maintained over ~2–5 Mb of the peaks on Chr. 5, 8, and 9 (r2 > 0.15; Fig. 5E–G). These regions included 184, 433, and 262 genes, respectively (Fig. 5E–G and Supplementary Table S12). Next, we aimed to detect potential candidate with the genes underlying these peaks that hypothetically regulate the activation of OGI, which is normally silenced via SINE insertion on the promoter and the resultant DNA methylations.11 Considering that, in all cases, homozygous genotypes act recessively for OGI activation loss-of-function of genes regulating DNA/histone methylation to silence transcription would be good candidates. Histone remodelling genes such as Chromatin remodelling 4,34 SET domain protein 25,35 and histone deacetylase 19, thought to be involved in jasmonic acid and ethylene signalling in Arabidopsis,36 are all located under the Chr. 5 peak (Supplementary Table S12, Sheet1). Candidate regulators within the Chr. 8 peak included SWADEE homeodomain homolog 1,37 histone deacetylase 2,38 and Jumonji family39 (Supplementary Table S12, Sheet 2), while the peak of Chr. 9 included the PHD finger protein40 and SET domain protein 3841 (Supplementary Table S12, Sheet3). Future in-depth sequence analysis of these candidates might help in the identification of candidate polymorphisms potentially involved in OGI activation/repression.3.5. Examination of GWAS in polyploid genomeGenome-wide analyses in polyploid genomes are often challenging in terms of (i) genotype calling, and (ii) haplotype phasing.42 For genotyping, we adopted the allele ratio per locus with high coverage for quantitative genotypes, as previously reported in potato and in blueberry.21,43 This approach, combined with the Pearson correlation was successful at detecting the effect of Y-chromosome dosage for OGI activation and other potential candidates. Furthermore, the compensation with OGI allele dosage with two approaches, (i) partial correlation (in correlation analysis using quantitative genotypes), and (ii) rrBLUP with the covariate of OGI dosage (in GWAS using diploidized genotypes), improved our ability to detect candidate loci. On the other hand, issues involving haplotype phasing still remain to be solved, since polyploids have more than two haplotypes per reference region, which are generally difficult to define, not only for conventional binary genotypes but also for quantitative genotypes. For instance, in our hexaploidy samples, the presence of many (>2) homologous haploblocks caused LD inconsistent with the order of the SNPs markers, despite of the F1 segregation line in which LD decay completely depends on recombinations (Fig. 5E), as observed in autotetraploid blueberry as well.43 In autohexaploid sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) with 90 chromosomes (2n = 6x = 90), 96 linkage groups (LGs) were generated, using only double-simplex SNPs showing a Mendelian segregation ratio in an F2 progeny.44 Such construction of well-separated LGs would allow QTL analysis with conventional tools, but the targets would be limited to simplex loci and, unless the genomes were significantly different, much of the genomic space would not be included. Here, we were able to include multiplex alleles in our genome-wide association analysis, and our results suggest that a simple GWAS approach can be used to identify polysomic candidates, if sufficient markers are available.Our results indicated that, in the additive model based on quantitative genotypes, individuals with higher dosages of OGI have a higher probability of male conversion. If we hypothesize that male conversion is associated with OGI activation, we can propose the following two hypothesis for cis-regulation of OGI to maintain OGI silencing (Fig. 6A): (i) multiple trans-acting factors can access the OGI promoter, each with slightly different sequence specificity, or (ii) epigenetic cis-factors of OGI, such as DNA/histone methylation, are modified independently, and thus, more copies of OGI alleles result in higher probability of OGI expression release. On the other hand, in both the additive and the diploidized additive models, all the loci on Chr. 5, 8, and 9 significantly affects male conversion rate (Fig. 5). This suggests that, although recessive alleles at these loci lack the function to maintain OGI suppression, the other alleles also vary in their ability to suppress OGI and/or have additive effects for silencing of OGI (Fig. 6B). Such a complex situation is not uncommon when dealing with polysomic genetic factors, and exemplifies how they can contribute to the acquisition or fine tuning of traits in a way that is not possible in a diploid situation. Hypothetical model for the mechanisms underlying OGI regulation in hexaploid persimmon. (A) Two hypothesis can be proposed for the dosage-dependent cis-regulation of OGI (see Fig. 4I): (i) variation in cis-factors within the OGI promoter sequences modulate the effect of the transcription factors accessing to the OGI promoter, or (ii) variation in the OGI promoter sequence results in a variation in epigenetic status. Both of these scenarios can be consistent with varying probability OGI activation, depending on the environmental conditions. (B) Model for the action of candidate genes on Chr. 5, 8, and 9, acting in dosage-dependent manner. Since recessive homozygosity had the highest effect on male conversion (OGI activation) in all three cases (Fig. 5H–J), the model predicts that the dominant (functional) alleles act to suppress OGI. The dosage-dependent effect (Fig. 5B) could originate either from multiple dominant alleles (A’ and A”) with slightly different ability, or additive action of a single A allele to suppress OGI expression.Hypothetical model for the mechanisms underlying OGI regulation in hexaploid persimmon.

IntroductionSpecies in the Rubiaceae family produce a wide range of specialized metabolites including alkaloids, terpenoids, and flavonoids.1–6 The most well-known compounds include the stimulatory alkaloid caffeine from Coffea species and the anti-malarial alkaloid quinine from Cinchona, a compound on the World Health Organization’s List of Essential Medicines.7 Lesser known is the medicinal shrub, Chiococca alba (L.) Hitchc. (Fig. 1A; also known as snowberry, ‘cahinca’, West Indian milkberry, and other regional names), that occurs naturally in tropical regions of North and South America.8 In Brazilian traditional medicine, C. alba is used to treat a wide variety of ailments. Its roots are used as a diuretic, an anti-viral, an anti-inflammatory, and as a treatment for rheumatism, hysteria, and snakebites.1,9 Although the use of the leaves is less frequent, leaves have been used to treat asthma, headaches, and diarrhea.10 Contemporary research has validated the use of C. alba as a folk medicine by confirming its anti-inflammatory11 and anti-microbial3 properties. Tests with the DNA-repair deficient Saccharomyces cerevisiae mutant, RS321, suggests that C. alba may have anti-cancer activity.4Chiococca alba.

It is potentially synthesized from a diterpene scaffold, followed by ring cleavage, carbon loss and lactonization. Ribenone has an unusual heteroatom-containing ring with demonstrated activity against Leishmania and potential anti-cancer activity.14,Chiococca alba also makes a number of kaurene type diterpenes like 1-hydroxy-18-nor-kaur-4,16-dien-3-one; 15-hydroxy-kaur-16-en-3-one, kaur-16-en-19-ol; kaurenoic acid; ent-17-hydroxy-16a-kauran-3-one and merilactone.10,12 Although considerable work has been done on the phytochemical and pharmacological aspects of C. alba, genes involved in the biosynthesis of merilactone, ribenone, and other ent-kaurene-derived C. alba diterpenes have not been identified.Terpene compounds are prevalent throughout the Plant Kingdom and are classified based on the number of isoprene units in the scaffold; diterpenes have four isoprene units and are typically derived from geranylgeranyl diphosphate (GGPP) via diterpene synthases (diTPSs) yielding the diterpene skeleton, which can then undergo further modification by cytochromes P450, acyl transferases, or other enzymes.15–19 Bioactive diterpenes from C. alba fall into the labdane-related superfamily, whose biosynthesis is characterized by initial bicyclization of GGPP by a Class II diTPS from the TPS-c subfamily into a bicyclic prenyl diphosphate intermediate [e.g. copalyl/labdadienyl diphosphate (CPP)].20 The resulting intermediate undergoes further cyclization and/or rearrangement catalysed by Class I diTPS from the TPS-e subfamily that acts to remove the diphosphate moiety and can form additional rings, double bonds, or hydroxyl groups.21–23Despite the diverse biochemical profiles of Rubiaceae species and their medicinal importance, genome assembly efforts within the Rubiaceae family have been limited beyond those with Coffea.24,25 Here, we present a de novo draft-quality genome assembly for C. alba, which has a basic chromosome number between 12 and 14, consistent with a 2n = 2x ploidy level.26 We assembled 10× Genomics linked reads using the Supernova assembler, an approach that has recently been implemented in several systems including a soybean relative, a pepper F1 hybrid, wild perch fish, and human.27,28 This assembly and other genomic analyses facilitated the identification and functional characterization of five diTPSs (CaTPS1-5) involved in the biosynthesis of C. alba diterpenes. Access to the C. alba genome sequence along with validated terpene biosynthetic pathway genes will enable improved understanding and discovery of specialized metabolites in this medicinal plant species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and growth conditionsMature C. alba plants were procured from Sweet Bay Nursery (Parrish, FL, USA) and grown in a greenhouse under ambient photoperiod and 24°C day/17°C night temperatures. Nicotiana benthamiana plants were grown in a plant growth room under 16-h light (24°C) and 8-h dark (17°C) regime.2.2. DNA and RNA library preparation and sequencingGenomic DNA was isolated from young leaves of a mature plant following a modified cetyl trimethylammonium bromide method.29 Illumina-compatible whole-genome sequencing (WGS) libraries were made from young leaf and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) in paired-end mode to 150 nt. Young leaf mate-pair libraries were prepared using the Nextera Mate Pair Library Prep Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) with a gel size selection of 3 and 4 kb. Libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 in paired-end high-output mode to 150 nt. A young leaf 10× Genomics Long Range library was made using the Chromium Genome Reagent Kit v2 (10× Genomics, Pleasanton, CA, USA) at the Van Andel Research Institute and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 in paired-end mode to 150 nt. All sequencing was performed at the Research Technology Support Facility at Michigan State University. All genomic DNA libraries generated in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1.Total RNA was isolated from mature root and mature leaf as described previously.30 Mature leaf and root RNA-Seq libraries were constructed by first purifying mRNA using the Dynabeads™ mRNA DIRECT™ Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) followed by the KAPA Stranded RNA-Seq Kit (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) with NEBNext® Multiplex Oligos for Illumina® (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA, USA). RNA-Seq libraries were sequenced on either an Illumina HiSeq2500, HiSeq 4000, or NextSeq500 in paired-end mode to 150 nt. Total RNA was extracted from leaf and root of three independent mature C. alba plants using the Spectrum™ Plant Total RNA Kit (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). Residual DNA contamination was removed using the TURBO DNA-free™ kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). RNA-Seq libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Preparation Kit with IDT for Illumina Unique Dual Index adapters. All libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4000 in single end mode to 50 nt. All RNA-Seq libraries generated in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S2.2.3. Genome size estimation and k-mer analysis of the C. alba genomeGenome size of C. alba was determined using flow cytometry at the Benaroya Research Institute at Virginia Mason in Seattle, WA, USA. Paired-end whole-genome shotgun sequencing reads for the ALLPATHS-LG assembly (RUB_AI, RUB_AI_02 and RUB_AZ) were error-corrected using ALLPATHS-LG (v52488)31 and the counts of canonical k-mers in the sequencing reads was generated using Jellyfish (v2.2.0).32 Analysis of the k-mer counts was performed using GenomeScope (http://qb.cshl.edu/genomescope/).332.4. Genome assembly and scaffold filteringFor the ALLPATHS-LG assembly (hereafter referred to as the AP assembly), paired-end and mate-pair reads were trimmed using Cutadapt (v1.11)34 with a quality cut-off of 15 and minimum read length of 25 nt. Mate-pair library reads were further processed with NextClip (v1.3.1)35 and only categories A, B, and C (R1 and/or R2 contained the junction adapter) were retained for assembly. ALLPATHS-LG (v52488)31 was run with default parameters with three WGS libraries with total reads equivalent to 86× coverage and two mate-pair libraries, with total reads equivalent to 30× coverage.For the 10× Genomics assembly (hereafter referred to as 10×), Supernova (v2.0.0)36 was run with 310 M 150 nt reads from a single 10× library, equivalent to 70× raw coverage and 48× effective coverage after accounting for duplicated reads, as calculated by Supernova. FASTA files were extracted from the raw assembly using the ‘mkoutput’ function (Supernova v2.0.1) with the ‘pseudohap2’ style and minimum scaffold size of 1 kb; pseudohap 1 was chosen for downstream analysis. Redundant scaffolds were removed using the ‘redundancy reduction’ module of Redundans,37 which performs all-versus-all self-alignment of scaffolds using LAST.38 Redundans was run multiple times to identify optimal identity and coverage cut-offs, which were specified using ‘–identity’ and ‘–overlap’, respectively.Mean scaffold read depth values were calculated from alignments of the 10× library to the different genome assemblies using BWA-MEM (bwa v0.7.12)39 with the ‘-M’ option followed by removal of duplicate reads using MarkDuplicates (picardTools v2.9.2; http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/); the total read bases aligned to each scaffold were calculated using SAMtools (v1.4)40 bedcov and divided by the length of each scaffold minus gaps. Identity and coverage cut-offs that best balanced collapsing split haplotypes without collapsing paralogous regions (see Results) were chosen for the final filtered 10× assembly. To complement the mean scaffold read depth analysis, self-alignments of the genomes were also used to visualize the decrease in inter-scaffold hits as redundant scaffolds were removed; these genome alignments were performed using nucmer (MUMmer v3.23)41 with the parameters ‘–maxmatch’ and ‘–minmatch 200’, followed by filtering for alignment length and identity using the ‘delta-filter’ function.Scaffolds in the filtered 10× assembly were queried against the NCBI nt database (downloaded 1 May 2018) using blastn (BLAST+ v2.6.0)42 with default parameters except ‘-max_target_seqs’ was set to 100000. Despite using a relatively lenient filter of E-value < e-40 and Query Coverage Per Subject > 10%, only one non-Viridiplantae scaffold which was the PhiX sequencing control (NC_001422.1) was detected. To remove chloroplast sequences, scaffolds were queried against Rubiaceae chloroplast genomes downloaded from NCBI (Supplementary Table S3) and a nucleotide BLAST search was performed using filters of ‘Query Coverage Per Subject’ > 97, ‘Query Coverage Per HSP’ > 50 and identity > 97.2.5. Genome assembly quality assessmentStandard sequence content and contiguity metrics were obtained using the ‘assemblathon_stats.pl’ from Assemblathon 243 using gaps of 2 or more Ns to delineate contigs within scaffolds. BUSCO (v3.02.2b)44 was run using the ‘embryophyta_odb9’ database (1440 BUSCO groups) in genome mode for the AP assembly, the unfiltered 10× assembly and the filtered 10× assembly, and in transcript mode for the longest ORF transcript of each gene annotated in the filtered 10× assembly.Genomic WGS DNA reads were aligned as described above. RNA-Seq reads were aligned to the genome assemblies using HISAT2 (v2.1.0).45 Alignment metrics were obtained using SAMtools flagstat and Picard CollectAlignmentSummaryMetrics (picardTools v2.9.2; http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/).2.6. Gene annotationA C. alba custom repeat library (CRL) was created with RepeatModeler (v1.0.8; http://repeatmasker.org) using the unfiltered 10× assembly. The CRL was searched against a curated library of plant protein-coding genes and sequences, removing matches with ProtExcluder (v1.1)46 and then combined with the RepBase (v20150807)47 Viridiplantae repeats to create a final CRL. The filtered 10× assembly was then masked with RepeatMasker (v4.0.6; http://repeatmasker.org) using the CRL with the ‘-s’, ‘-nolow’, and ‘-no_is’ options, resulting in 260.89 Mb (47%) of masked sequence.For subsequent gene annotation steps requiring RNA-Seq alignments, only paired-end RNA-Seq libraries were used. Read alignments to the filtered 10× assembly were obtained using TopHat2 (v2.1.1)48 with the parameters ‘–min-intron-length 20’ and ‘–max-intron-length 20000’ in stranded mode, merging the alignments for the root libraries. Genome-guided transcript assemblies were constructed with these alignments using Trinity (v2.3.2)49 with the parameters ‘–genome_guided_max_intron 10000’ and ‘–SS_lib_type RF’, filtering away transcripts shorter than 500 bp.Ab initio gene prediction was performed by training AUGUSTUS (v3.2.2)50 on the soft-masked assembly using the leaf RNA-Seq alignments. Initial gene predictions were then generated using AUGUSTUS and the hard-masked assembly. The initial gene predictions were then refined using PASA251 (v2.0.2) utilizing the genome-guided transcript assemblies as evidence. High-confidence gene models were defined as transcripts with a best PFAM (v31)52 hit with sequence E-value < 1e-5 and domain E-value = 1e-3 as identified using HMMER (v3.1b2)53 or having Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads (FPKMs) > 0 in either the root or the leaf dataset as calculated using Cufflinks2 (v2.2.1)54 with the parameters ‘–multi-read-correct’ and ‘–max-intron-length 20000’ in stranded mode. Transcripts with a significant (based on above thresholds) best PFAM hit that was a transposable element-related domain were also removed.Expression abundances from replicated leaf and root RNA-Seq libraries were generated to examine terpene synthase (TPS) expression profiles (Supplementary Table S2). RNA-Seq reads were trimmed using Cutadapt (v1.18)34 with a quality cut-off score of 20 and a minimum read length of 30 nt. The RNA-Seq reads were then aligned to the filtered 10x assembly using HISAT2 (v2.1.0)45 in stranded mode with a minimum intron length of 20 and a maximum intron length of 60,000. FPKMs were generated using Cufflinks (v2.2.1)54 and SAMTools (v1.9)40 with the parameters ‘–multi-read-correct’, ‘–min-intron-length 10’, and ‘–max-intron-length 60000’ in stranded mode.2.7. Comparative genome analysesTo identify homologous genes for synteny analysis, BLASTP (BLAST+ v2.6.0)42 was run using the longest peptide isoform for each gene, comparing C. alba to itself, Coffea canephora to itself and C. alba versus C. canephora in both directions. BLAST hits were filtered for E-value = 1e-5 and only the top five hits (based on bit score) for each query sequence were retained. These BLAST results were used to identify syntenic blocks using MCScanX v2017032255 with default parameters and visualized using SynVisio (https://synvisio.github.io). The longest predicted peptide isoforms of C. alba, C. canephora,24,Vitis vinifera (grapevine),56,Arabidopsis thaliana,57 and Amborella trichopoda58 (grapevine, Arabidopsis, and Amborella data were downloaded from Phytozome v1259) were analysed using Orthofinder v2.2.760 with default settings except ‘-M msa’. Overlapping orthogroups membership was visualized using UpSet v1.3.3.61 Gene ontology (GO) terms were annotated using InterProScan v5.28.67.0.62 GO term enrichment for genes in C. alba-specific orthogroups (including orthogroups containing only one C. alba gene) was tested using Fisher’s exact tests implemented in topGO v2.34.0.63 Peptide sequences were aligned using Clustal Omega (v.1.2.1) and a maximum likelihood tree was generated using MEGA version X.64 The Poisson correction parameter and pairwise deletion of gaps were applied. The reliability of branching was assessed by the bootstrap re-sampling method using 1000 bootstrap replications.2.8. Identification and cloning of candidate genes involved in C. alba diterpene biosynthesisInitial efforts to identify TPS genes in C. alba utilized de novo transcript assemblies generated by trimming RNA-Seq reads using Cutadapt (v1.11)34 with a quality cut-off of 30 and minimum read length of 50 nt and running Trinity (v2.3.2)49 with ‘–normalize_max_read_cov 50’ and ‘–SS_lib_type RF’, retaining only transcripts that were >500 bp. To identify terpene synthesis-related genes in C. alba in the intial de novo transcript assemblies and the C. alba genome, we utilized reference TPS peptides (mono-, sesqui-, and di-TPS) curated from multiple plant species by Terzyme65 and a list of P450s known to be involved in terpene synthesis (Supplementary Table S4). Reference terpene synthesis genes were compared with predicted peptides in C. alba using BLASTP (BLAST+ v2.6.0) and the results were filtered for E-value = 1e-10, subject coverage = 80%, and identity = 40%. To identify the precise genome coordinates for the TPS de novo Trinity transcripts in the C. alba genome, GMAP (v20160401)66 was used to align the longest isoform from each ‘gene’ as determined by Trinity to the genome assemblies; ‘–no-chimeras’ was set to avoid chimeric alignments, ‘–trimendexons 0’ was used to prevent trimming of alignment ends, and coverage and identity cut-offs were set using ‘–min-trimmed-coverage’ and ‘–min-identity’ respectively. Candidate genes were amplified from single-stranded cDNA generated from total root RNA using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) with oligo(dT) primers. Putative TPS cDNAs were cloned into pJET1.2 vector (Thermo Fisher, USA). All primers used are listed in Supplementary Table S5.2.9. Functional characterization of C. alba TPS candidates in N. benthamianaFor functional characterization of putative TPS genes in N. benthamiana, full-length coding sequences (CDS) of sequence-verified TPS genes were cloned into the pEAQ-HT vector67 (kindly provided by Prof. G. Lomonossoff, John Innes Centre, UK) using In-Fusion® HD Cloning Plus (Takara Bio, CA, USA). The N. benthamiana system is considered to be highly efficient for characterization of TPSs largely due to native codon usage, presence of subcellular compartment for localization of diTPS, synthesis of the common precursor GGPP, and flexibility of using different combinations of TPSs as well as the ease of upscaling the infiltration process for production of milligram scale terpenoid compounds for structural elucidations.22,68–70 Thus, TPSs were transiently co-expressed in N. benthamiana together with the suppressor of gene-silencing p19,71,Coleus forskohlii (syn. Plectranthus barbatus) enzymes 1-deoxy-d-xylulose 5-phosphate synthase (CfDXS) and GGPP synthase (CfGGPPS), according to a previously established protocol72; coexpression of the upstream genes, CfDXS and CfGGPPS substantially increase the level of the substrate GGPP.22Five to eight days post-infiltration, metabolites of three leaf disks (3-cm diameter, 1 disk per leaf) were extracted in 1 ml n-hexane with 1 mg/l 1-eicosene as internal standard at room temperature overnight in an orbital shaker at 200 rpm. Plant material was collected by centrifugation and the organic phase transferred to GC vials for analysis. As controls, p19, CfDXS, and CfGGPPS were co-expressed with and without individual candidate genes. The functionally characterized reference diTPSs ZmAN2 (Zea mays),73 NmTPS2 (Nepeta mussinii),22 TWTPS21 (Tripterygium wilfordii),68 ZmSKL4 (Z. mays),74 EPTPS3,68 as well as CfTPS2 and CfTPS3 (C. forskohlii)70 were included for comparison.2.10. Analytical proceduresAll gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analyses were performed on an Agilent 7890 A GC with an Agilent VF-5ms column (30 m × 250 µm × 0.25 µm, with 10 m EZ-Guard) and an Agilent 5975C detector. The inlet was set to 275°C splitless injection of 1 µl, He carrier gas with column flow of 1 ml min-1. The detector was activated after a 4-min solvent delay. The oven temperature ramp was either (A) 80°C hold 0.5 min, increase 50°C min-1 to 250°C, increase 10°C min-1 to 280°C, increase 50°C min-1 to 320°C hold 4 min or (B) 40°C hold 1 min, increase 40°C min-1 to 200°C, hold 5 min, increase 10°C min-1 to 280°C, increase 40°C min-1 to 320°C hold 3 min.For GC-MS-based root and leaf metabolomics, 500 mg of finely ground fresh roots and leaves were extracted for 24 h in 5 ml n-hexane. The extracts were concentrated to 1 ml under N2 and analysed by GC-MS using Method B as described above.For ultra-high-performance liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (UHPLC/MS) metabolomic analysis, 500 mg of fresh leaf and root tissues were finely ground and extracted with 10 ml 80% methanol by incubating in the dark at room temperature for 24 h. The extracts were concentrated down to 1 ml by blowing in N2 gas. A 10 µl volume of each extract was subsequently analysed using a 15 min gradient elution method on an Acquity BEH C18 UHPLC column (2.1 × 100 mm, 1.7 µm, Waters) as previously described.752.11. Compound purification and NMRFor the production of diterpene compound sufficient for structural analysis by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), we used a large-scale N. benthamiana agroinfiltration system as previously described.68 Briefly, 25 N. benthamiana plants were vacuum co-infiltrated with a combination of CaTPS1/CaTPS5 and CfGGPPS/CfDXS. After 5 days, 250 g (fresh weight) of agroinfiltrated leaves were finely ground using a blender and subjected to two rounds of overnight extractions in 500 ml hexane. The extract was dried on a rotary evaporator. The diterpene compound was purified from the resin using silica gel flash column chromatography with a mobile phase of 5% ethyl-acetate in hexane.NMR experiments were performed on an Agilent DDR2 spectrometer operating at 499.90 MHz equipped with a PFG OneNMR Probe or on a Varian Inova spectrometer operating at 599.73 MHz equipped with an indirect PFG HCN probe. Experiments were performed without spinning and at ambient temperature unless otherwise noted. The following parameters were used for 2D NMR experiments: NOESY: 16 transients, 200 increments, 500 ms mixing time; gCOSY: 8 transients, 256 increments; gHSQCAD: 8 transients, 128 increments; gHMBCAD: 8 transients, 256 increments. Standard vendor supplied processing was performed on all datasets including zero filling, linear prediction, baseline correction, and apodization. CDCl3 peaks were referenced to 7.26 and 77.00 ppm for 1H and 13C spectra, respectively.Optical rotation was measured with a Perkin Elmer Polarimeter 341 (Überlingen, Germany) using a microcell (pathlength 100 mm, volume 1 ml). Measurements were carried out at 20°C, wavelength 589 nm.3. Results and discussion3.1. Genome assembly and removal of redundant scaffoldsThe haploid genome size of C. alba determined by flow cytometry was 567 Mb. k-mer analyses predicted a smaller genome size varying from 480 to 537 Mb with heterozygosity rates ranging from 0.37% to 0.49% depending on the k-mer size (Supplementary Fig. S1). Two genome assembly approaches were performed: a traditional approach using paired-end and mate-pair read assembly with the ALLPATHS-LG assembler31 and a newer method using a 10× Genomics linked read assembly using the Supernova assembly algorithm.36As expected, the 10× assembly outperformed the AP assembly across all basic contiguity metrics, achieving a scaffold N50 of 1.75 Mb versus 103 kb in the AP assembly, and a longest scaffold length of 10.1 Mb versus 727 kb (Table 1 andSupplementary Table S6). The 10× assembly had a total assembly size of 656 Mb compared with 534 Mb in the AP assembly, whereas flow cytometry estimated the genome as 567 Mb, suggestive that the 10× assembly has retained ‘split haplotypes’. We tested this by performing self-alignments of the assemblies (Supplementary Fig. S2). The 10× assembly had visibly more self-homology compared with the AP assembly, with duplicated sequences more prevalent in shorter scaffolds. Assessment of mean scaffold read depth revealed a bimodal distribution in the 10× assembly, with the more prominent peak (collapsed haplotypes) at roughly double the read depth of the secondary peak (split haplotypes), further confirming the presence of split haplotypes in the 10× assembly.Assembly and annotation metrics of the C. alba genomeAssembly and annotation metrics of the C. alba genomeSequence redundancy was also observed in a Supernova assembly of perch, in which 66.19 Mb of scaffolds was removed from an initial assembly of 1,024.4 Mb using filter thresholds of = 99% identity and = 95% coverage in alignments with other scaffolds in the assembly.28 Thus, we implemented a similar approach for C. alba, by first removing scaffolds smaller than 5 kb then self-aligning the 10x assembly and filtering out redundant scaffolds. In addition, we added read depth analyses to inform the selection of identity and coverage cut-offs (Supplementary Fig. S3). Thresholds of 80% identity and 95% coverage provided a balance between reducing the split haplotypes and limiting the collapsing of paralogous regions (evidenced by read depth higher than the more prominent peak). From this assembly, we also removed three scaffolds composed of only ns totalling 9,000 bp, an 8,200 bp scaffold corresponding to the PhiX sequencing control, and three chloroplast scaffolds totalling 138,637 bp; subsequent references to the ‘filtered 10× assembly’ refer to this assembly unless otherwise noted.3.2. Assessing genome assembly completenessAligning WGS and RNA-Seq reads indicated comparably high levels of completeness in the AP assembly and the filtered 10× assembly with alignment rates of ~98% for the WGS libraries and between 92% and 95% for the RNA-Seq libraries when aligned to either assembly (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8). However, rates of properly paired read alignments emphasized the superior contiguity in the 10× assembly, at ~98% for the WGS libraries and 89% for the 10× library (Supplementary Table S7).To assess if informative scaffolds were inadvertently removed by efforts to filter out redundant scaffolds in the 10× assembly, read alignment rates were also obtained for the pre-filtered assembly. Comparison of the raw 10× assembly to the filtered 10× assembly, yielded a reduction of alignment rates by 0.6–1%. Conversely, high-quality alignments (MAPQ = 20, as defined by PicardTools) were increased by 0.8–0.9% for the WGS libraries, presumably due to the removal of highly similar, redundant target sequences in the filtered 10× assembly. Interestingly, high-quality alignments of the 10× library were decreased by 1% in the filtered 10× library. This decrease in high-quality alignments may be connected with a 2.4% decrease in properly paired reads compared with a 0.05–1.1% decrease for the WGS libraries; we speculate that the larger insert size of the 10× library may make paired alignments more haplotype-specific. Overall, alignment rates of RNA-Seq reads were reduced by 1.5–2.8%, but high-quality alignment rates decreased by only 0.4–1.1%. Consistent with the hypothesis that the scaffold filtering had minimal impact on the gene content of the 10× assembly, alignment of de novo assembled transcripts were a mere ~1% lower in the filtered 10× assembly, and missing BUSCOs increased by 0.7% (Supplementary Table S9). As to genic content, 92.2% complete, 2.0% fragmented, and 5.8% missing BUSCO orthologues support that the 10× assembly is robust (Supplementary Table S9). Overall, the metrics for the filtered 10× assembly indicate high quality and completeness for a draft genome assembly.3.3. Genome annotation and orthologous relationships with other plant speciesThe filtered 10× assembly was annotated using an ab initio gene finder trained with RNA-Seq alignments followed by refinement of gene models using genome-guided transcript assemblies as evidence. A total of 34,878 genes composed of 49,586 gene models were annotated (Supplementary Table S10). The mean gene length and mean CDS length were 3.4 and 1.2 kb, respectively, with a mean of 5.55 exons per gene model. Filtering of the high-confidence gene set based on expression and protein domain signatures (see Materials and methods) led to a set of 28,707 high-confidence genes encoding 43,217 gene models. BUSCO analysis on the annotated genes raised the score to 93.2% complete, 2.6% fragmented, and 4.2% missing (Supplementary Table S9).We identified syntenic blocks between the snowberry scaffolds and the C. canephora genome; a total of 750 blocks with 21,697 syntenic gene pairs were identified (Fig. 2A). To explore conservation of the caffeine N-methyltransferase (NMT) cluster24 on Chromosome 9 in coffee, we searched for C. alba regions with synteny to the coffee NMT genes. C. alba scaffolds 327 and 265 harboured syntenic blocks of 24 and 11 genes, respectively (Fig 2B andSupplementary Table S11) in which syntelogs of the NMT genes are absent. In fact, C. alba NMT orthologues predicted by OrthoFinder2, g2037.t1 and g34221.t1, are on separate scaffolds (343 and 560, respectively). Instead of Chromosome 9 of C. canephora, the longest syntenic blocks for scaffolds 343 and 560 were both matches to Chromosome 8 (Supplementary Table S11). Together, these results suggest that the caffeine NMT cluster is absent in C. alba reflecting the unique evolution of caffeine synthesis in the Coffea genus within the Rubiaceae family.76Synteny between C. alba and C. canephora.(A) Syntenic regions between C. alba scaffolds (ca) and C. canephora Chromosome 9.

Consistent with evolutionary relatedness, the next highest intersections were between the two Rubiaceae species, C. alba and C. canephora, and between all four non-Amborella species at 888 and 797 orthogroups, respectively. GO term analysis of paralogous groups specific to C. alba, totalling 4,765 genes, highlighted genes that may be involved in C. alba-specific plant architecture and specialized metabolism, with enrichment in terms including ‘oxidation-reduction process’, ‘amine metabolic process’, ‘cellulose microfibril organization’, ‘quinone binding’, and ‘iron ion binding’ (Supplementary Tables S12 and S13). Additionally, there was an enrichment of ‘viral capsid’ and ‘viral process’ genes, which had homology to geminivirus protein domains. Extensive collinearity of two scaffolds harbouring these genes compared with the C. canephora genome indicated that these are viral integration events and not due to a contaminated sample (Supplementary Fig. S5).Among orthogroups containing C. alba TPS genes, gene counts were similar between C. alba and C. canephora both when summed across orthogroups based on TPS type and within individual orthogroups (Fig. 3). Mild gene family expansions were observed in C. canephora in a monoTPS orthogroup (OG0003358) and a sesquiTPS orthogroup (OG0006883), with four coffee paralogues to one C. alba orthologue in both cases. For both orthogroups, the C. canephora expansion was driven by tandem duplication (Supplementary Table S14). The most remarkable result among all species was a dramatic expansion in a sesquiTPS orthogroup (OG0000030) in V. vinifera, with 45 genes compared with 11 in both C. canephora and C. alba, the next highest species. Interestingly, previous studies in grapevine identified distinct sesquiterpene profiles in different cultivars that are speculated to be caused by TPS variants77; expansion in the OG0000030 sesquiTPS orthogroup may have facilitated this functional diversity.Gene counts of orthogroups containing C. alba genes predicted to be involved in terpene synthesis. Orthogroups were classified as mono-, sesqui-, or diTPSs by collapsing the TPS annotation for C. alba gene members.

Terpene synthases in C. albaTo gain a deeper understanding into the biosynthesis of bioactive diterpenoids in C. alba, we mined its genome for TPSs using the previously described phylogeny-guided gene discovery strategy.69,78–81 We identified 27 putative TPS genes, of which, ten were classified as diTPSs (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S15). Of the identified diTPS genes, four (CaTPS1, 2, 6, and 7) were predicted as Class II diTPSs (TPS-c subfamily) based on the presence of characteristic DxDD signature motif.82 Conversely, CaTPS3, 4, 5, 8, and 9 were classified as Class I diTPSs (TPS-e subfamily) as they featured the conserved DDxxD and NDX2(S/T)X3E motifs known to be relevant for catalysis in Class I diTPSs. CaTPS10 was predicted to be a member of TPS-f sub-family, members of which are involved in the biosynthesis of linear chain diterpenes including geranyllinanool (TPS4; Fig. 5).83 Of the ten diTPSs identified in the C. alba, only the Class II diTPSs, CaTPS1, and CaTPS2 and the Class I diTPSs, CaTPS3, CaTPS4, and CaTPS5 could be retrieved as full-length cDNA for further functional analysis based on presence of a start and stop codon and alignments to other known, validated TPSs. To determine the enzymatic activity of these diTPSs, we conducted in vivo combinatorial assays using the transient Agrobacterium-mediated co-expression in N. benthamiana.22,68Phylogenetic tree of TPSs.

(A) Following the common framework of labdane biosynthesis in angiosperms, pairs of monofunctional Classes II and I diTPSs were identified that produce distinct diterpene scaffolds in C. alba. First, CaTPS1 and CaTPS2 transform the central precursor GGPP (0) into the bicyclic prenyl diphosphate intermediates ent-CPP (1) and ent-LPP (2), respectively. Second, Class I diTPSs CaTPS3/CaTPS4 act on 1 to produce ent-kaurene (3), precursor to ent-CPP derived general [Gibberellic acid GA12; (9)] and specialized metabolites (10–13) in C. alba. CaTPS3/CaTPS4 also use 2 as substrate to produce (13R)-ent-manoyl oxide (4). We hypothesize 4 to be the immediate precursor of Ribenone (7) via sequential oxidation at C3 to Ribenol (6), presumably by a cytochrome P450 enzyme. CaTPS5 catalysed the formation of 13-epi-dolabradiene (5), a possible committed step in the biosynthesis of the C19 diterpene, merilactone (8).

Functional characterization of C. alba diTPSsCombinatorial expression of Classes II and I diTPSs has been widely used to determine the identity and stereochemistry of enzyme products.22,68,81 Taking advantage of this modular pairwise activity of Classes II and I diTPSs in angiosperm labdane biosynthesis, we tested the C. alba diTPSs in combination with functionally characterized Classes II and I reference diTPSs.To investigate the function of CaTPS1 and CaTPS2, we transiently expressed them in combination with the Class I diTPS N. mussinii ent-kaurene synthase which converts ent-CPP to ent-kaurene (1),22,68,C. forskohlii miltiradiene synthase (CfTPS3), catalysing cyclization of (+)-CPP into miltiradiene,70 and Salvia sclarea sclareol synthase (SsSS), a promiscuous enzyme converting ent-CPP to ent-manool, (+)-CPP to (+)-manool or labdenol diphosphate (LPP) to sclareol.22,84 As a reference and for product identification, we also expressed a suite of known Class II diTPS, (+)-CPS (CfTPS1),70,Z. mays ent-CPS (ZmAN2),85,T. wilfordii ent-8-LPP (TwTPS21),68 and C. forskohlii (+)-8-LPP (CfTPS2).70 This comparison enabled verification of the stereo-selectivity of CaTPS1 and CaTPS2.CaTPS1 yielded a diterpene with identical retention time and mass spectrum to the product of ZmAN2, illustrating that the primary product of CaTPS1 is CPP [(1), Fig. 5]. The stereochemistry of CaTPS1 was investigated by co-expression of CaTPS1 with NmTPS2, CfTPS3 or SsSS. Combination of CaTPS1/NmTPS2 yielded a single major peak (Supplementary Fig. S6a) that matched the ZmAN2/NmTPS2 product (Supplementary Fig. S6b), ent-16-kaurene (3), establishing CaTPS1 as ent-CPP synthase (Supplementary Fig. S6). CfTPS3 is a Class I diTPS specific for diphosphate substrates in normal (+) configuration. The combination of CaTPS1 co-expressed with CfTPS3 did not yield a diterpene product. When co-expressed with SsSS, which has broad substrate specificity, the activity of CaTPS1 yielded manool in ent-configuration (Supplementary Fig. S7). The product was identified by comparison with the authentic standard afforded by the reference diTPSs ent-CPP synthase (ZmAN2) and SsSS.22 These results establish CaTPS1 as ent-CPP synthase.The product was identified by comparison with the authentic standard afforded by the reference diTPSs ent-CPP synthase (ZmAN2) and SsSS.22,Ent-CPP synthases are involved in the biosynthesis of gibberellins and ent-kaurene-derived specialized metabolites.20Co-expression of CaTPS2 and NmTPS2 generated a product with a retention time and mass spectra matching to that of the reference combination TwTPS21/EpTPS1 product, (13R)-ent-manoyl oxide (4) (Supplementary Fig. S8c and d). To support the stereochemistry, we compared against the combination of CfTPS2/CfTPS3 yielding the stereoisomer, (13R)-manoyl oxide in normal configuration (Supplementary Fig. S8e). The retention time of the CfTPS2/CfTPS3 was distinct, indicating that CaTPS2 affords stereoselectively (5R, 8S, 9S, 10S)-labda-13-en-8-ol diphosphate [ent-8-LPP (2)] (Fig. 5 andSupplementary Fig. S8).Class I diTPSs, CaTPS3-5 were tested in combination with CaTPS1, CaTPS2, and four reference Class II enzymes. Substrates accepted by each enzyme and the products are given in Supplementary Figs S6–S8. When combined with either of the ent-CPP synthases, (CaTPS1 or ZmAN2), CaTPS3 and CaTPS4 resulted in the formation of ent-kaurene (3) as identified by comparison to the reference combination of ZmAN2/NmTPS222 (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S6c–f), supporting a function of CaTPS3 and CaTPS4 as ent-kaurene synthases. The diTPSs CaTPS3 and CaTPS4 share over 95% identity and their genes seem to have evolved as a result of local tandem duplication as they are directly adjacent in the snowberry genome (Supplementary Table S15). Expression of CaTPS3 and CaTPS4 is partially overlapping. CaTPS3 is equally expressed in both leaf and root tissues (mean FPKM leaf 6.2 vs. root 5.8) whereas mean FPKM values for CaTPS4 were higher in root compared with leaf tissue (root 8.5 to leaf 6.3; Fig. 5). Since C. alba produces a suite of ent-kaurene-derived specialized metabolites in the roots (Fig. 5), it is possible that both diTPS contribute to their biosynthesis. Since C. alba produces a suite of ent-kaurene-derived specialized metabolites in the roots (Fig. 5), it is possible that both diTPS contribute to their biosynthesis, as well as the formation of gibberellin phytohormones, sharing the same diterpene scaffold.3.6. CaTPS2 yields access to the precursor of ribenoneThe combinatorial assay of CaTPS2 (ent-8-LPP synthase) with CaTPS3 and CaTPS4 yielded (13R)-ent-manoyl oxide (4) identified by comparison with the reference product formed by TwTPS21/EpTPS1 (Supplementary Fig. S8a and b). The configuration and stereochemistry of (13R)-ent-manoyl oxide is consistent with ribenone [3-keto-(13R)-ent-manoyl oxide, (7)]—a major C. alba diterpene, indicating that the biosynthetic route for ribenone may involve the combination of CaTPS2 and either CaTPS3 or CaTPS4. Accumulation of (13R)-ent-manoyl oxide (4) in C. alba, or Rubiaceae, has not been reported. We analysed root and leaf extracts of C. alba by GC-MS and confirmed the presence of (13R)-ent-manoyl oxide (4) in the root tissues alone (Supplementary Fig. S8f), consistent with the presence of ribenone and biosynthesis proceeding through ent-16-kaurene (3; Supplementary Fig. S9).10 CaTPS2 was highly expressed in leaves and moderately in root tissues of C. alba (Fig. 5) indicating that the encoded diTPS CaTPS2 may also supply ent-8-LPP to yet unidentified diterpenes in C. alba, beyond the biosynthesis of ribenone in C. alba roots through CaTPS4.3.7. CaTPS5 is a Class I diTPS catalysing formation of epi-dolabradieneCaTPS5 only showed substantial activity with ent-CPP as substrate. When co-expressed with CaTPS1 or the reference enzyme ZmAN2, CaTPS5 converted ent-CPP into a single product (5) with a fragmentation pattern that matched retention time and mass spectrum of dolabradiene, product of a recently identified TPS (ZmSKL4) from Z. mays74 (Fig. 5 and Supplementary S10b). Dolabradiene is known to occur in two configurations, the 13(S)-dolabradiene and its 13(R)-epi-dolabradiene stereoisomer, which have been reported across different families including Araucariaceae, Euphorbiaceae, Rubiaceae, Cupressaceae, and liverworts.86–89 To determine the configuration at C-13, we scaled up the N. benthamiana transient expression. Hexane extract from about 250 g (fresh weight) N. benthamiana leaves infiltrated with constructs carrying CaTPS1, CaTPS5, and CfDXS/CfGGPPS enabled us to purify the product by silica chromatography. Chemical shift assignments were determined through analysis of 1H, 13C, gHSQC, gHMBC, gCOSY, and NOESY NMR data (Supplementary Table S16 and Figs S11–S17). Relative stereochemistry was determined by inspection of NOESY data, energy minimized 3D structural models, and 13C chemical shift data. Key to relative stereochemical assignment were nuclear Overhauser effect (NOE) correlations between protons on C19 and C20 (1.07 and 0.75 ppm, respectively), establishing a cis configuration for those methyl groups. The relative stereochemistry of the vinyl group (C15/16) and methyl (C17) was determined by the presence of a NOE cross-peak between the vinylic proton (5.80 ppm, H15) and the methyl (0.75 ppm, H20; Supplementary Fig S17). Further evidence of this configuration is a strong NOE interaction of H15 and H16a, b (larger cross-peak on H16a) with H14b (1.35 ppm). The large (12.7 Hz) coupling constant to H8 is consistent with an axial position of H14b and H8, and consequently a position of H14b on the same face as C20 due to large NOE correlation to H15. Finally, the carbon chemical shifts of the vinyl and methyl groups (151.5/108.5 and 23.03 for C15/C16 and C17, respectively) are consistent with an axial methyl group and equatorial vinyl, and the stereochemical configuration as 13-epi-dolabradiene.90 Polarimetric analysis yielded the optical rotation of [a]D + 86.25° (c. 0.0016, dimethyl sulfoxide [DMSO]), in consonance with the earlier reported value of [a]D + 86,88 while the optical rotation for dolabradiene was reported as [a]D -70.88 This configuration is consistent with the earlier described stereochemistry of merilactone.134. Summary and conclusionsWe generated a high-quality draft genome sequence of the medicinal plant, C. alba, using 10× Genomics linked read technology. Annotation of the genome revealed 27,707 high-confidence genes with robust synteny with the caffeine-producing coffee genome. We were able to annotate 27 TPSs and identify genes that encode for plausible intermediates in the biosynthesis of the structurally unique antimicrobial diterpene natural products, merilactone and ribenone. As the second species in the Rubiaceae with a genome sequence, the C. alba genome provides a new resource to identify genes involved in specialized metabolism in a family with rich chemical diversity.Data availabilityRaw read sequences for the genome and transcriptome analyses are available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information under BioProject ID PRJNA543280.

IntroductionWhole-genome sequencing (WGS) has become a crucial technique for investigation of the outbreaks and genomic evolution of pathogens.1–3 Technological advances have enabled large-scale studies that involve the surveillance of hundreds to thousands of isolated microbes.2,4–6 In addition, high-resolution variant analyses have been used to distinguish isolates whose genomes differ only by a few bases.1,7–10 The resulting phylogenomic information is, therefore, expected to help trace the infection route of pathogens.Short-read sequencing is a fundamental technology for large-scale WGS analyses owing to its advantages of low error rates (<1%), high throughput, and low cost per isolate.11 Technically, some variant-calling tools, based on read mapping, were reported to output several false results, 12 and de novo assembly was found to be an effective method to improve such analyses for complex genomes.13,14 Even for bacterial genomes, read mapping or reference-guided assembly methods were reported to be influenced by the use of reference genomes15; de novo assembly can reduce biases that stem from the differences of richness of reference genomes among lineages.Nanopore long-read sequencing is a powerful technology for assembling circular genomes16 and has been applied for the surveillance of outbreaks owing to its portability.17,18 However, the fine-scale (base-level) accuracy of long read-only assemblies could be inferior to that of hybrid assemblers that utilize short reads.11,19Single-molecule real-time (SMRT) sequencing by Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) is also considered effective in assembling gap-free genomes. Nonetheless, there are small and cheap units (flow cells) such as Flongle (Oxford Nanopore Technologies; throughput, ~2 Gbp) for the nanopore sequencers, and they can be run without outsourcing the procedures. Because of these features, the nanopore sequencers may be cost- and time-efficient when targeting microbes with small genomes compared with the SMRT sequencers.From the end of 2019 to February 2020, early investigations of the novel corona virus associated with the global outbreak employed the short read and de novo assembly.20,21 Nanopore long reads were also applied, but combined with short reads to improve the accuracy of the assembled sequences in certain studies.22 In other words, the short-read genomic sequencing is still a practical method in the emergent circumstances at present. Although the targets of these investigations are viral genomes of ~30 kb in length, de novo assembly may be employed to capture variable genomic regions; similar situations will occur in bacterial genomes containing variable genomic regions derived from prophages and other types of mobile genetic elements that often encode drug-resistance genes and virulence-related genes.Thus, to satisfy the stringent requirement of accuracy, especially the fine-scale accuracy, for high-resolution bacterial WGS analyses, short-read-based de novo assemblers require further improvement. Therefore, we developed an accurate assembler named Platanus_B.2. Materials and methods2.1. Overview of Platanus_BIn this section and the following ones, the overview and specific functions of Platanus_B are described. The other miscellaneous procedures are described in the Supplementary Methods. The overview of Platanus_B and the differences between Platanus_B and related assemblers, Platanus23 and Platanus-allee,24 are illustrated in Fig. 1. These two related assemblers target diploid genomes, which do not principally exist in bacterial genomes, and try to merge (Platanus) or separate (Platanus-allee) heterozygous genomic regions. Although some elementary functions for de novo assembly, such as contig-assembly and scaffolding, are derived from these tools, the overall procedure is different and many specific functions are implemented (Fig. 1).Workflow of Platanus_B and the related assemblers. Orange- and blue-framed boxes correspond to error-correction and Platanus_B-specific processes, respectively.Workflow of Platanus_B and the related assemblers. Orange- and blue-framed boxes correspond to error-correction and Platanus_B-specific processes, respectively.The key features of Platanus_B are as follows: first, it employs multiple types of error-removal processes, and is thus expected to effectively handle a wide range of errors. Second, several functions can be iterated, which may be impractical for large eukaryotic genomes when considering the calculation cost.Platanus_B first assembles short reads into contigs using de Bruijn graphs. This function is derived from Platanus but skips the bubble-removal step that is required for diploid genome assembly. Platanus_B primarily utilizes the paired ends of short reads and iterates the following steps six times:Error detection and split of sequences based on k-mersUntangling the cross-structures in a (gapped) de Bruijn graphScaffoldingError detection and split of sequences based on physical coverageError detection and masking of sequences based on read mappingGap closing and edge extension.When the process returns to Step (1) from (6), scaffolds and local contigs are then merged through the de Bruijn graph. Internally, Steps (2)–(4) are iterated further (Fig. 1). After these iterations of (1)–(6), the error-removal Steps (4) and (5) are applied again, and extension and gap closing are performed using the intermediate iteration results. Platanus_B can also use long reads in Steps (2)–(4) assisted by the Minimap2 aligner25; however, this function is optional.2.2. Error detection and split of sequences based on k-mersThis function can remove small-scale misassemblies avoiding the issues derived from ambiguities in read mapping. The input comprises short reads and contigs assembled through the de Bruijn graph. k corresponds to the maximum value used in the previous contig-assembly step, and the numbers of k-mers in short reads are counted. A contig is split at a position where the k-mer coverage (number of occurrences in short reads) is <1/10th of the median value for the contig.2.3. Untangling the cross-structures in a (gapped) de Bruijn graphTo simplify a de Bruijn graph and extend contigs, Platanus_B untangles the cross-structures that are generated from repetitive sequences in a genome in a de Bruijin graph. This untangling function is also applied to a gapped de Bruijn graph, which is a de Bruijn graph that allows gaps between contigs. This function is derived from Platanus-allee.24 However, Platanus_B uses the mean coverage depth instead of the depth of heterozygous regions to determine whether a cross-structure should be solved. This function is iterated twice within the outer loops (Fig. 1).2.4. ScaffoldingTo determine the arrangements of contigs and obtain long sequences (scaffolds) allowing gaps, Platanus_B performs a scaffolding step. This function is derived from Platanus and Platanus-allee, and can handle long reads and mate pairs in addition to paired-end reads. As a modification, sub-functions related with heterozygous regions, such as removal of bubbles in a scaffold graph, are omitted. This function is iterated twice within the outer loops (Fig. 1).2.5. Error detection and split of sequences based on physical coverageThis function can remove relatively large-scale misassemblies. Physical coverage (the number of paired ends that span a position) is calculated by mapping the paired ends and/or other types of libraries to input scaffolds. In addition, for each position, the number of paired ends that are linked to a neighbouring position and another scaffold are counted and stored as the ‘diff-coverage’ value. Positions that indicate low physical coverage and high diff-coverage are then detected as misassembly candidates and the scaffolds are split at these positions. Specifically, a split will be performed if all the following conditions are satisfied:diff-coverage/physical coverage > 2physical coverage < median physical coverage/2median physical coverage > 2diff-coverage > 2.2.6. Error detection and masking of sequences based on read mappingThis function can remove base-level errors. The reads are mapped to the input scaffolds using ungapped alignments (seed size, 32 bp), and the highest sequence identity and a corresponding position is calculated for each read, discarding results with multiple highest identities. Mapping results are categorized according to the threshold of identity (97%) and coverages, both are calculated for each category. If low-identity coverage exceeds high-identity coverage, the corresponding position is masked (the base is changed to ‘N’).2.7. Gap closing and edge extensionPaired ends are mapped to the scaffolds. Reads corresponding to the gaps (‘N’s) and edges of scaffolds are collected and locally assembled. If the resultant contigs overlap the adjacent regions, the gaps are closed or the edges are extended. This function is derived from Platanus with the following modifications:The k values of de Bruijn graphs for local assemblies are 20 and 80 rather than 24 and 72. In this step, contigs are generated from the two de Bruijn graphs of the two k values, and the two contig sets are merged.A k-mer coverage cut-off of 2 instead of 3 is used for local assemblies.If a gap is partially closed, it is filled and the gap size is reduced.Edges of sequences are extended.2.8. Reconstruction of a de Bruijn graph when starting the next iterationTo reduce redundancies and improve the lengths of contigs, scaffolds, and local contigs are merged through a de Bruijn graph. Local contigs represent the contigs that are assembled in the gap-closing step but are not used to close gaps. k is increased according to the progress of iterations, where k = mean read length × [1 + (current number of iterations - 1)/6]. Short branches are excluded from the graph in a similar manner as performed in the contig assembly step; sequences with errors can be excluded.2.9. Benchmarks using actual bacterial genome dataPlatanus_B and the existing assemblers were benchmarked with sequence data from five strains of four bacterial species26–30 (Table 1), using seven preparation kits for paired-end reads of MiSeq (Illumina, CA, USA; Supplementary Table S1). MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK) with a flowcell of R9.4.1 chemistry was used for long reads of two strains (Supplementary Table S1). The read length of the MiSeq sequencing was 300 bp, and the nominal insert sizes ranged from 300 to 600 bp. Although MiSeq has been one of the most popular sequencers so far, newer short-read sequencers such as NovaSeq are generally run with read length of 150 bp. To simulate the reads from the new sequencers, we additionally trimmed the reads of MiSeq and generated 150-bp reads. For details of sample preparation procedures, including culturing of Escherichia coli strains, sequencing, public data collection, pre-processes of reads, refer to Supplementary Methods. The complete genome sequences of all these strains were available and used for evaluation. As an indicator of the repetitiveness (i.e. difficulty) of the genomes, the occurrences of 100-mers in the reference genomes were counted. The rate of repetitive (occurrences =2) 100-mers is shown in Table 1. Escherichia coli O157 Sakai and Porphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 exhibited a high repetitive 100-mer rate, which may reflect the presence of highly similar prophages27 and transposable elements,28 respectively.Strains used in the benchmarksThe reference genomic data were downloaded from the RefSeq database. Repetitive 100-mer rate indicates the rate of 100-mers that occur more than 1 time in a reference genome.

The RefSeq assembly accessions of the reference genomes were GCF_000008865.2,27 GCF_000005845.2,26 GCF_000829175.1,30 GCF_000828775.1,29 and GCF_000010505.1.28The popular assemblers, MaSuRCA,31 SPAdes,32 Unicycler,33 Canu,34 Flye,35 Wtdbg2,36 and miniasm37 were compared with Platanus_B. The first three assemblers accept either a single short-read library or a mixed (short and long reads) library. The last four assemblers accept long-read library. As miniasm does not have a function to construct consensus sequences, polishing with long reads was performed for its results by Racon38 three times. Additionally, we benchmarked DISCOVAR de novo,14 which is designed for paired ends whose read lengths =250 bp, for the 300 bp reads. A polishing tool, Pilon,39 was also tested for all assemblies. For long-read-based assemblers (Canu, Flye, Wtdbg2, and miniasm+Racon), Pilon was executed three times for each result.Indicators to benchmark accuracy and contiguity of assemblies were measured by QUAST40 using reference genomes. Variable read coverage was tested using random sampling of reads. For each case, 10 replicated inputs were generated and indicators were averaged. Details of samples, preparation, and analysis are provided in the Supplementary Methods.3. Results and discussion3.1. Benchmark using short- and paired-end readsAs a representative of the application of Platanus_B, Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table S2 show results for paired-end reads obtained from the TruSeq PCR-free kit. The nominal insert size was 600 bp. The coverage bias of this kit was similar to that of the relatively new kits.41 In most of the cases of 300 bp reads (24/25), among all assemblers tested, Platanus_B obtained the largest NGA50 values which are indicators of contiguity corrected for misassemblies. DISCOVAR provided the best lowest base error rate [(mismatches + indels)/100 kbp] and number of misassemblies in majority of the cases (16/25 and 17/25, respectively), which might reflect the effect of the special function for read length =250 bp. Among the versatile assemblers (Platanus_B, MaSuRCA, SPAdes, and Unicycler), Platanus_B provided the lowest values for these indicators in majority of the cases (13/25 and 15/25, respectively). For a repeat-rich strain, E. coli O157 Sakai, the base error rate advantage of Platanus_B was even more notable. The same trend was observed when polishing with Pilon (Supplementary Fig. S6 and Supplementary Table S3) or using 150-bp reads (Fig. 2B andSupplementary Table S4). To validate the effect of the error-correction functions of Platanus_B, the version in which these functions were deactivated were also benchmarked (Fig. 2C andSupplementary Table S5). NGA50 values of Platanus_B were comparable to the deactivated version for all strains, therefore rejecting the possibility of a poor effect on sequence contiguity. Base error rates and the number of misassemblies were approximately halved or lesser than those of the deactivated version for the repeat-rich strains, E. coli O157 Sakai and P. gingivalis. Consequently, the effectiveness of error corrections was validated especially for repeat-rich samples. With respect to the run time, in most cases, Platanus_B consumed less CPU and real time when compared with Unicycler [Table 2(A and B); 25/25 and 19/25, respectively]. Peak memory usages are shown in Table 2(C). Memory usage of Platanus_B depends on a value specified as an option (-m), and Platanus_B could assemble all the samples with memory usage <3 GB (-m 1). Therefore, Platanus_B shows good practicability in terms of both accuracy and time. As Platanus_B was designed to improve assemblies by introducing more steps than there are in Platanus and Platanus-allee (Fig. 1), it was expected to consume several-fold more real time than these; however, all real times of Platanus_B were <22 min (Table 2; the number of threads, 4), further confirming its practicability.Contiguity and accuracy of the short-read-based assemblers, and effects of the error-correction function in Platanus_B.

This kit was reported to have biased read coverage41; however, the results indicate that Platanus_B is robust to such bias. Similar results were obtained for other sequence library preparation kits (Fig. 3; Supplementary Figs S6 and S7 and Supplementary Tables S9–S13). Among the versatile assemblers, the benchmarks for all cases of 300-bp reads, Platanus_B provided the best NGA50 values and base error rates in 99 and 84 cases, respectively, out of 158 cases. The trend was found to be similar to that for 150-bp reads (Fig. 3B and D, Supplementary Fig. S5, and Supplementary Tables S8 and S11), which supports the versatility of Platanus_B.Benchmark using multiple preparation kits for short reads.

Benchmark using nanopore long-read sequencingFor benchmark of nanopore (R9.4.1) long-read inputs (Supplementary Figs S8–S11 and Supplementary Tables S15–S18), the long read-only assemblers (Canu, Flye, Wtdbg2, and miniasm+Racon) showed high base error rates and never achieved the best NGA50 values, even when Pilon was applied, confirming the importance of short reads for base-level accuracy. Although Platanus_B showed the best base error rate in many cases (49/120), the other hybrid assemblers were superior with respect to the other indicators (NGA50 and the number of misassemblies).To test the feasibility of Platanus_B as a module in a hybrid assembler, we combined the results of Platanus_B into MaSuRCA and Unicycler using the integrated function of Platanus_B (‘combine’ command). This combination improved the base error rate in majority of the cases, and the Platanus_B + MaSuRCA combination resulted in the best NGA50 values in 65 out of 120 cases (Supplementary Figs S12–S15 and Supplementary Tables S20–S23). Therefore, Platanus_B is also expected to be used as a module for short reads in a hybrid assembler or a pipeline (e.g. SPAdes in Unicycler) to enhance the final sequence lengths and accuracy.Additionally, we tested to assemble reads from MinION with new chemistry, R10.3. The targeted strain was E. coli K-12 MG1655. The reads are public data (SRA accession, ERR3890216) and the base-called reads (tool, Guppy v3.4.5) were downloaded from https://figshare.com/articles/Ecoli_K12_MG1655_R10_3_HAC/11823087. As a result (Supplementary Table S19), although base error rates of the long-read-based assemblers were lower than those of the R9.4.1 chemistry, the rates were still much higher than those of the short-read-based assemblers.3.3. Comparison between short- and long-read-based assemblies using coding sequencesTo verify the practicability of short-read-based assemblers and compare them with long-read-based assemblers, we calculated the success rate of constructions of protein-coding sequences (CDSs) for each assembly result. The target strains were E. coli O157 Sakai and E. coli K-12 MG1655 (the number of CDSs, 5291 and 4357, respectively), and we counted the number of the reference CDSs that were exactly matched to the assembled sequences to calculate the success rate (exact-match rate).Platanus_B achieved the exact-match rates of over 90% in 10 case and over 95% in 9 other cases (out of 10 cases; 2 strains; coverage, 10–50; Fig. 4). Although the other short-read-based assemblers (MaSuRCA, SPAdes, Unicycler, and DISCOVAR) also had high exact-match rates, the number of high exact-match rates (=90%, =95%) of Platanus_B was higher. Note that some tools are not designed to handle low-coverage data and we tested the data to investigate the limits of the tools. Although MaSuRCA exhibited the highest exact-match rates for K-12 MG1655 when coverage depths were =20, it indicated several-times higher base-level error rates and more misassemblies for many cases (Figs 2 and 3), suggesting that it produced many false sequences. We defined Platanus_B-specific CDS as a CDS of which the mean exact-match rate from Platanus_B was =80% while the values from the other assemblers were <50% for 10 random replicates. Among the versatile short-read-based assemblers for the E. coli O157 Sakai strain, there were 107 Platanus_B-specific CDSs, 55 of which contained the word ‘phage’ in their description. Considering that this strain contains multiple prophages similar to each other and these prophages encode genes associated with toxicity,27 the exact-match rates of Platanus_B were noteworthy.Coding sequence exact-match rates of short- and long-read-based assemblies for E. coli strains. With mixed input of long and short reads followed by polishing with Pilon a coverage depth corresponding to the column names, ×10–50, is obtained for each library. For example, the total coverage depth is 20 (long reads, 10; short reads, 10) if the coverage depth is denoted as ‘×10’. Pilon was executed three times for each long-read-based assembly (Canu, Flye, Wtdbg2, and miniasm+Racon).Coding sequence exact-match rates of short- and long-read-based assemblies for E. coli strains.

When short-read-based polishing (Pilon) was applied to these results, the exact-match rates increased and often exceeded the values of short-read-only assemblies, inferring the high contiguity and low fine-scale accuracy of the long-read-based assemblers. In other words, the long-read-based methods require additional short-read sequencing and the short-read-based methods are cost-effective when collecting exact CDSs. To summarize, short-read-based assemblers exhibited good practicability and comprehensiveness in terms of CDS-construction, and it is recommended to combine long-read-based assemblers with short-read-based polishing.3.4. ConclusionFrom the benchmark results above, Platanus_B’s advantages of contiguities and accuracies for short-read inputs will be useful to proceed large-scale projects, which target hundreds of isolates and focus on a few variant sites between genomes. Short-read sequencing is still being utilized for many studies. Although it is difficult to estimate exact sequencing costs due to variations in market channels, there is remarkable improvement in the cost-performances of short-read sequencers. The sequencing costs of NovaSeq (Illumina) and MGISEQ-2000 (current name, DNBSEQ-G400; MGI Tech, Shenzhen, China) were reported to be 12–18 USD/Gbp and 10 USD/Gbp, respectively.42 Although read lengths of these sequencers are generally 150 bp, we confirmed the high performance of Platanus_B for the 150-bp reads (Figs 2B, 3B, and D, Supplementary Fig. S5, and Supplementary Tables S4, S8, S11, and S14), and the tool is expected to work for the reads from the new sequencers. We demonstrate that the combination of Platanus_B and short-read sequencers can be used for comprehensive scans of bacterial genomes. If sufficient data such as 95% of CDSs and/or core-genomic regions for a project are obtained using this tool, costs are reduced. For example, long-read sequencing is performed only if targeted regions or an appropriate fraction of a genome (judged using core-genes) are not assembled by the short-read-based method. Additionally, the fine-scale accuracy of Platanus_B can be utilized for high-resolution phylogenomic analyses that have not been discerned.Supplementary data are available at DNARES online.We thank Dr Yasuhiko Horiguchi and Dr Mariko Naito for providing the genomic DNA of B. bronchiseptica S798 and P. gingivalis ATCC 33277, respectively.DDBJ/ENA/GenBank BioProject PRJDB9013.This work was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) KAKENHI grant numbers 15H05979 and 18K19286.None declared.Platanus_B is implemented in C++ and Perl and is freely available at http://platanus.bio.titech.ac.jp/platanus-b/ or GitHub (https://github.com/rkajitani/Platanus_B) under GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) version 3.

IntroductionThe growth rate in the exponentially growing phase is the most important parameter representing both genetic and environmental influences on bacterial growth dynamics. Predicting the growth rate of a growing bacterial population according to the intrinsic status and/or extrinsic conditions is highly desirable. To date, extensive studies involving the systematic quantitative investigation of bacterial growth have been performed. By using systematic manipulation or engineering, e.g. single-gene knockout1 and genome reduction,2,3 the contributions of single genes and large genomic fragments to bacterial growth were quantitatively evaluated.4–6 The correlation identified between the genome size and the growth rate strongly suggests that population fitness is linked to genome-wide features (e.g. transcriptome, mutation rate) in vivo.5,7The transcriptome, which illustrates a global view of the transcriptional abundance of all the genes in the genome, is reorganized constantly in response to genomic and environmental perturbations.8–10 As the transcriptome is known to be associated with population fitness,11–13 the contribution of the transcriptome to population fitness is of great interest. Our previous studies revealed the coordination of gene expression with the growth rate13 and the linkage between transcriptome reorganization and increases in fitness in adaptation and evolution.14,15 These findings indicated that the transcriptome, rather than the specific regulation of limited gene groups, increased population fitness. However, whether and how the transcriptome is linked to population fitness remains unknown.A single parameter representing the transcriptome is critical for determining the linkage if it exists. Previous studies demonstrated that the power law (Zipf’s rule) was a universal principle governing the transcriptome in living organisms;16,17 however, we failed to find the linkage between this law and the growth rate.18 As an alternative global feature representing the transcriptome, the chromosomal periodicity of transcriptome has been proposed,19,20 which is determined using the Fourier transform, a mathematical method used to estimate the periodic patterns in an entire data set according to the sinusoidal wave.21 Applying the Fourier transform to the transcriptome data set could estimate the periodic patterns of gene expression levels across the entire chromosome. Computational analyses identified some particular periods associated with bacterial transcriptomes22 of distinctive spatial patterns across the chromsomes.19,20 These chromosomal periodic patterns were proposed to be contributed by the chromosomal topology, which related to either the chromosomal domain structure or the specific DNA contents.23–25 These findings of chromosomal periodicity were used to obtain static snapshots of the transcriptome, but whether and how the chromosomal periodicity of the transcriptome is linked to the growth rate are unknown.In the present study, a total of 213 growth profile-associated transcriptomes were analysed that represent an assortment of E. coli strains growing under or responding to various environments. This study seeks to determine whether the chromosomal periodicity of the transcriptome is robust or variable in response to environmental and genetic perturbation and whether and how chromosomal periodicity is coordinated with bacterial growth.2. Materials and methods2.1. Escherichia coli strains and growth conditionsThree types of E. coli genomes were included in the transcriptome analyses: the full-length genomes of MG1655 and DH1 and the reduced genome of MDS42.2 A number of genetically engineered strains were comprised of genomes of types DH114,26 and MDS42,13 which led to an assortment of genetic backgrounds. The growth media were all based on the minimal medium M63;27 if required, the medium was supplemented with nutritional ingredients, such as, leucine and histidine, to compensate for the lost gene function resulting from genetic engineering. In addition, the growth temperature was varied from 37°C to 45°C. The E. coli cells either in the exponential growth phase or at the stress response phase were subjected to the analyses. In brief, a total of 72 combinations of the genetic and conditional variations were acquired, which were summarized in Supplementary Table S1. The details of the genetic manipulation and the experimental conditions can be found in previous reports.13–15,18,26,28,292.2. Transcriptome data setsThe transcriptome data sets used in the present study were obtained from the microarray raw data assigned with the GEO access numbers of GSE33212, GSE49296, GSE55719, GSE52770 and GSE61749 by using the customized platform EcFS.30 The finite hybridization model31 was applied to determine the gene expression levels, which were calculated as the log-scale mRNA concentrations (pM). Data filtering, normalization and averaging of the biological replicates for the subsequent transcriptome analyses were described previously.13,28 The resulting transcriptome data sets were associated with the growth profiles (e.g. growth rate and growth phase), genomic backgrounds and environmental conditions. The details were previously described in the corresponding studies.13–15,26,28 A total of 213 transcriptome data sets, comprising 72 combinations that varied in terms of the genomic background and environmental conditions as described above (Supplementary Table S1), were included in the analyses. For correlation analysis, we only used the transcriptome data sets that were obtained at the exponential growth phase and thus linked to precise growth rates.2.3. Computational analysesAll computational analyses were performed with R.32 The gene expression levels on a logarithmic scale were used for the analyses as described previously.18,33 The transcriptome data sets obtained at the exponential growth phase (Supplementary Table S1) were subjected to correlation analysis, that is, the correlations with the growth rate (r) and the periodic parameters (a, b and c). The parameters of a, b, and c represented the amplitude of the period, the phase of the period and the mean transcriptional level, respectively. The statistical significance of the Pearson correlation coefficients was evaluated by the t-test. The Z-score was used for the standardization of the MG1655 transcriptomes obtained from the present data sets and the GyrA Chip-seq data for MG1655 obtained from another study.20 The Z-scores of both the gene expression and the GyrA binding were calculated and averaged for 100-kb bins with a sliding distance of 1 kb for the correlation analysis and the Fourier transform. To compare the chromosomal periodicities of all transcriptomes, the genome position was normalized in the range of 0~1, simply by dividing the respective length of genome sequence, because the transcriptomes were from different E. coli strains of varied genome sizes. In addition, the start points of the genomes were according to the genomic sequences deposited in DDBJ and were identical for all transcriptomes.2.4. Evaluation of chromosomal periodicityA standard Fourier transform was employed to determine the chromosomal periodicity of the transcriptomes and the GyrA binding activity by using the periodogram function in R. All 213 transcriptomes were subjected to the Fourier transform, in which the expression data for 4,393, 3,760 and 4,377 genes in the E. coli strains with the genomic backgrounds of MG1655, MDS42 and DH1 were used, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). The CDS information for MG1655, MDS42 and DH1 were obtained from the DDBJ databank under the accession IDs U00096, AP012306 and AP012030, respectively. The sizes of the genomes used for the Fourier transform were 4,642, 3,976 and 4,622 kb for MG1655, MDS42 and DH1, respectively. The chromosomal periodicities of both the transcriptomes and the GyrA binding activity were evaluated with a sliding distance of 1 kb and are shown in 100-kb bins. The approximate curves of the periodicity were calculated using the highest peak of the periodogram and were fitted by minimizing the square error of the approximate curve and the series of expression values. The statistical significance of the periodicity was assessed with Fisher’s g test,21 which was performed using the GeneCycle package in R.3. Results and discussion3.1. The common chromosomal periodicity of the transcriptomeTo investigate whether the growth conditions and the genomic background influenced the chromosomal periodicity of the transcriptome, a total of 213 E. coli transcriptome data sets, which were associated with the growth profiles and were acquired with the same microarray platform, were used in the present study. The growth conditions were varied in terms of temperature, nutrition level and osmotic pressure, and there was a large variation in the genomic backgrounds (Supplementary Table S1, as described in Materials and methods). Fluctuations in gene expression across the entire genome were confirmed (Fig. 1A), and chromosomal periodicity was evaluated with the Fourier transform.Chromosomal periodicity of the transcriptome.

(D) Overlapping periods of the transcriptomes. The chromosomal periodicity of 202 transcriptomes showing six periods (orange in C) were plotted together. The colour variation corresponds to that shown in (A).Intriguingly, the analysis results showed the highly conserved chromosomal periodicity of the transcriptomes, which was independent of the growth conditions and the genomic backgrounds. For instance, the most significant spectral powers (i.e. the max peak of the predicted wavelength) identified in two transcriptomes associated with different growth rates (r) were exactly the same (Fig. 1B, left panels). Consequently, this resulted in an identical chromosomal periodicity (Fig. 1B, right panels), although the two transcriptomes represented the E. coli cells growing at different temperatures. Overall, 202 out of 213 transcriptomes presented a common chromosomal periodicity of six periods (Fig. 1C) as the highest priority in the Fourier transform. Of note, all 11 exceptions showed a chromosomal periodicity of six periods as the second priority and that of a single period as the first priority (Supplementary Fig. S1). Neither specific genetic background nor particular growth condition was detected in these exceptions. As the statistical significance of the chromosomal periodicity was further proven by Fisher’s g test for all transcriptomes (Supplementary Fig. S2), the determination of the common chromosomal periodicity of transcriptomes, which consisted of six periods, was highly reliable. This result agreed with those of previous studies reporting the periodic transcriptomes of six or more periods either in wild-type E. coli strains or under regular growth conditions.20,22,28In addition, the chromosomal periodicity of the transcriptomes was somehow synchronized. Despite the large variation in both the genomic backgrounds of the E. coli strains and the environmental conditions of the population growth, the six periods of a total of 202 transcriptomes almost overlapped (Fig. 1D), which indicated the similarity in the phase of periodic transcriptome. Such similar directional changes in gene expression among the genomic positions (i.e. overlapped phase of periods) further demonstrated the universality of the chromosomal periodicity of the transcriptomes irrespective of genetic and environmental disturbances. This was the first finding that revealed that neither the number of the periods nor the wavelength was linked to bacterial growth condition.3.2. Correlation between the growth rate and the amplitude of the periodic transcriptomeHere, the parameters a, b, and c represented the amplitude of the period, the phase of the period (i.e. the genomic position of the period initiation), and the mean transcriptional level, respectively (Fig. 2A). The estimation of the three parameters was performed by minimizing the square error in the curve fitting. The constant T was the wavelength of the period of the highest spectral power estimated by the Fourier transform.

The vertical axes stand for the frequencies of the corresponding parameters in varied scales.The theoretical fitting successfully identified a significant correlation between the growth rate and the amplitude of the periodic transcriptome. The values of a, b and c were calculated by curve fitting with Equation (1), and subsequently averaged among the biological repeats. Note that parameter b was further normalized because of the variation in the genome length. The parameter a was positively correlated with the growth rate (Fig. 2B), whereas such a correlation was not detected for the parameters b and c (Supplementary Fig. S3). The analysis clearly determined a simple correlation between the growth rate and the amplitude of the period, although the transcriptomes/combinations largely differed in terms of the genotypes and environments (Supplementary Table S1). This correlation strongly suggested that population fitness was associated with the magnitude of differential transcription along the chromosome. This finding provided an intriguing linkage between the bacterial growth and the significance of transcriptomic changes.Investigations of the contributions of the genomic background and the environmental conditions failed to observe any significant relationship with the growth rate. According to previous reports,13–15,18,26 four types of environmental variations were roughly categorized as regular (no stress) conditions and conditions with changes in temperature, nutrition level and osmotic pressure. The distributions of the four parameters representing the growth and the periodicity of the transcriptome were largely dissimilar among the four categories (Fig. 2C), which reflected the properties of the data sets. No environment-dependent feature or correlation among the parameters a, b, and c was found (Fig. 2C). Additionally, genetic engineering might affect the phase of the period (i.e. normalized b), as a difference was detected between the wild-type genome and the other genomes (Supplementary Fig. S4). The genetic reconstruction possibly changed the genomic position of the period initiation, although more data sets were required to support this assumption.3.3. Mechanisms of the conserved chromosomal periodicity of transcriptomesTo understand the universality of the periodicity of transcriptomes, a simple assumption was made that the essential genes determined the six periods. A total of 302 genes were experimentally determined to crucial for E. coli in common (https://shigen.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/pec/).34 Such essentiality might have determined the chromosomal periodicity. However, neither deleting the essential genes from the transcriptome nor substituting the true expression values with zero altered the common periodicity of the transcriptome (Supplementary Fig. S5). This result indicated that the periodicity of the transcriptome was not simply due to the genomic localization of the essential genes.As the domain structure of chromosome might contribute to transcriptional activity,33,35–37 whether the common chromosomal periodicity of the transcriptome was attributed to the chromosomal organization was determined. The macrodomain model was proposed for the E. coli chromosome, with four structured domains and two non-structural regions.38–41 The normalized periodicity of the transcriptomes showed that the six periods were roughly positioned within the six domain regions of the E. coli chromosome (Fig. 3A), which was consistent with previous findings that showed the similar six periods.20,22,28 As the six periods of transcriptome linked to the six domain regions of the chromosome, the highly overlapping phases of the periodic transcriptome (Fig. 3A) suggested that the chromosomal macrodomain structure remained conserved, regardless of the genomic and environmental disturbances.Comparison of the common periodicity of the transcriptomes to chromosome structures.

Ori and dif are indicated by the broken lines in black.Moreover, the DNA topology-related molecular mechanisms may play a role in determining the chromosomal periodicity of the transcriptome. Bacterial chromosomal structures are highly dynamic and compacted in association with nucleoid-associated proteins (NAPs). Previous studies indicated that the chromosomal supercoiling of ~10-kb domains20,23 was potentially attributed to the chromosomal localization of NAPs, e.g. H-NS,42 and the chromosomal supercoiling of 600~800-kb domains might be triggered by DNA gyrase.20 As the common period identified in the present study was ~700 kb, which was similar to the domain size triggered by DNA gyrase, whether GyrA, the functional subunit of DNA gyrase, participated in the chromosomal periodicity of transcriptome was analysed. A weak but statistically significant correlation was verified between the transcriptome of the wild-type strain MG1655 in the present study and the abundance of chromosomally bound GyrA in the exponentially growing MG1655 in a previous report20 (Fig. 3B). Such a correlation seemed to be common in all transcriptomes (Supplementary Fig. S6) if the properties of the binding of GyrA to the genome remained unchanged. So far, it was unknown whether the variation in either the genomes or the growth phases caused any changes in the GyrA binding activities. This weak correlation between gene expression and binding activity suggested somehow the similarity of the chromosomal periodicity of GyrA binding and that of the transcriptome. Although the six periods were not the first priority for GyrA binding (Supplementary Fig. S7), the chromosomal periodicities of GyrA binding activity and the transcriptome in MG1655 were somehow coordinated (Fig. 3C). As the chromosomal macrodomain structure was reported to be relaxed in the stationary phase,42 the high-throughput experiments directly linking the growth phase, genome, transcriptome and the GyrA binding activity are required for the precise verification of the correlations. Additionally, the imperfect positioning (coordination) of the ori/dif domains to the corresponding periods of transcriptomes might be resulted from either the divergence of the experimental and computational approaches or the difference of genome size.3.4. Linking the periodicity of the transcriptome to population fitnessThe present study successfully found a direct linkage between population dynamics and the transcriptome (Fig. 4). The transcriptome is influenced by both the genomic background and the environmental conditions; consequently, it determines bacterial growth. Previous studies of transcriptomes successfully classified the genes into diverse categories that functioned either specifically in response to environmental changes or generally in relation to the growth rate.11–13 These achievements linked the individual gene function and/or gene expression to the growth. However, whether there was any quantitative relationship directly linking the transcriptome to the growth remained unaddressed.Scheme of the correlation between the growth rate and the chromosomal periodicity of the transcriptome. Shadowed boxes indicate the profiles of the transcriptome and the corresponding population dynamics. The broken and solid curves in the upper box indicate the small and large amplitudes of the periodic transcriptomes, respectively, and those in the bottom box indicate slow and fast growth, respectively.Scheme of the correlation between the growth rate and the chromosomal periodicity of the transcriptome. Shadowed boxes indicate the profiles of the transcriptome and the corresponding population dynamics. The broken and solid curves in the upper box indicate the small and large amplitudes of the periodic transcriptomes, respectively, and those in the bottom box indicate slow and fast growth, respectively.The present study first identified a single parameter (i.e. the parameter of a) that represented well the overall feature of the transcriptome. That is, the amplitude of the chromosomal periodicity of the transcriptome represents the magnitude of the changes in gene expression across the genome. Moreover, fast growth was linked to a large amplitude of the periodic transcriptome (Fig. 4, solid curves). The correlation between the growth rates and the amplitudes of periodic transcriptomes was independent of the environmental conditions and the genomic backgrounds. This novel finding was a breakthrough for understanding how the transcriptome determined population fitness because it was the first demonstration that the magnitude of chromosomal differentiation of gene expression was correlated with the growth rate. The additional analysis failed to find the correlation between the genomic sequence (the GC-content) and the chromosomal periodicity of transcriptomes (Supplementary Fig. S8). It is currently unknown whether the genome replication links to the periodic transcriptome, what the benefits are for the E. coli to possess the conserved chromosomal periodicity of transcriptomes, and whether the six-period is an evolutionary consequence. These are highly intriguing questions required to be addressed in the future.The growth rate was the only global parameter representing the adaptiveness of a growing bacterial population. The amplitude of the periodic transcriptome could be considered as an alternative to the growth rate, which is a global parameter for evaluating the population fitness. Further studies are required to investigate the mechanisms for such a periodicity and its physiological role. In addition to network reconstruction,43 the assessment of the global pattern of the transcriptome might be applied for predicting population fitness, which would be beneficial for industrial applications to microbial production of various chemicals and biological materials and the fundamental investigation of living principles.Supplementary data are available at DNARES online.We thank Shigeto Seno for the programming assistance.

IntroductionThe roots of most plants are colonized by mycorrhizal fungi. This symbiotic interaction is ancient, perhaps dating back to the origin of land plants, and many of its genetic components have been co-opted to allow symbiotic nitrogen fixation in legumes.1 Much of the overlapping genetic framework, as well as components specific to both types of symbioses, have been uncovered using the model legumes Lotus japonicus (Lotus) and Medicago truncatula (Medicago).2 Lotus is a perennial legume that has a short generation time, abundant flowers, and a small diploid genome with an estimated size of ~500 Mb.3 In addition, Lotus is self-compatible and amenable to tissue culture and Agrobacterium transformation.4 It has been used very successfully for forward genetic studies, resulting in the first identification of a plant gene (Nin) required for nodulation,5 and the discovery of receptors for rhizobium Nod factors (NFR1 and NFR5)6 and exopolysaccharides (EPR3).7Lotus is also interesting from a legume phylogenetic point of view, as it is a member of the Robinoid clade, which lacks other species with comprehensive genetic and genomic resources. The Robinoids are part of the larger Hologalegina clade, which also includes the IRLC clade that comprises Medicago and important crops such as pea (Pisum sativum), chickpea (Cicer arietinum), alfalfa (Medicago sativa), and white clover (Trifolium repens).8 The Hologalegina clade is sister to the Indigoferoid/Milettioid clade that includes soybean (Glycine max), common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), pigeon pea (Cajanus cajan), and cowpea (Vigna unguiculata).8 All these species engage in symbiotic nitrogen fixation, but their root nodule morphology differs. The Indigoferoid/Milettioid species soybean and common bean and the Robinoid species Lotus produce round, determinate nodules, while the IRLC legumes instead form elongated, indeterminate nodules with persistent meristems.9High-quality genetic and genomic Lotus resources will thus nicely complement those of other well-characterized legume species, facilitating functional, comparative, and phylo-genomic studies of symbiotic nitrogen fixation, arbuscular mycorrhization, and other legume traits of interest.The genetic resources already available for Lotus include sequenced natural accessions10 and recombinant inbred lines (RILs),11,12 as well as extensive populations of TILLING lines13 and LORE1 insertion mutants.14 In addition, large volumes of Lotus expression and LORE1 data have been integrated in the online portal Lotus Base15 (https://lotus.au.dk). Two Lotus accessions, MG-20 and Gifu B-129 (Gifu), have been especially frequently used.16 So far, genome sequencing efforts have focused exclusively on MG-20, resulting in the release of version 1.0, 2.5, and 3.0 MG-20 assemblies17 (https://www.kazusa.or.jp/lotus/ and https://lotus.au.dk/). MG-20 version 3.0 is a hybrid assembly based on Sanger and Illumina data that comprises 132 scaffolds covering 232 Mb aligned to the six Lotus chromosomes and an additional 162 Mb of sequence in 23,572 unanchored contigs. This MG-20 assembly has proved very useful for genetic mapping and for genome-wide transcriptome, methylation, and insertion mutant analyses,7,14,18,19 but it remains incomplete. Gifu originates from central Japan and is closely related to most of the sequenced accessions,10 whereas MG-20 is an atypical Lotus accession that originates from Miyakojima Island in the far south of Japan close to Taiwan. Considering also that the LORE1 insertion mutant collection14 was generated in the Gifu background, a high-quality Lotus Gifu reference genome would not only facilitate comparative genomics studies, but also serve to underpin improvement of functional genomics and intraspecific diversity resources in Lotus.Here, we present a high-quality Lotus Gifu reference assembly constructed based on ~100× PacBio read coverage and scaffolded using Hi-C and high-resolution genetic map data. We use this high-quality assembly to explore the positional clustering of putative orthologs of Medicago lncRNAs and compare nodule-regulated gene clusters between Lotus and Medicago. Conserved gene regulation was found for root and nodule samples, but evidence supporting conservation of the symbiotic islands discovered in Medicago did not emerge.2. Materials and methods2.1. PacBio data generation and assemblyLotus Gifu high-molecular weight DNA was extracted as described20 and sent to Earlham Institute and Takara Bio Inc. for PacBio sequencing. A total of 11.8 million reads with an average length of 8 kb were generated. The PacBio reads were assembled using Canu (version 1.3)21 with the parameters: corOutCoverage = 100, errorRate = 0.015, corMhapSensitivity = normal, corMaxEvidenceErate = 0.15, oeaMemory  = 15, cnsMemory = 40. The assembled contigs were then polished using PacificBiosciences’ GenomicConsensus package using Quiver (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/GenomicConsensus).2.2. Constructing genetic maps based on data from two RIL populationsPaired-end reads from RILs of Gifu × Lotus burttii and Gifu × MG-20, as well as those from their respective parental lines (Lotus Gifu, Lotus MG-20, and L. burttii), were mapped to the polished assembly using BWA-MEM.22 Picard (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) was used to dedupe the generated BAM files, followed by variant calling using mpileup provided by SAMtools.23 The resulting VCF files were filtered based on the following criteria: (1) minimum quality of 30, (2) minimum depth of 50, (3) must be biallelic, and (4) cannot contain missing genotypes. To improve the quality of the genetic map, further filtering was performed using a Python script to select solely for single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are homozygous in the Gifu parent and homozygous alternative in the second RIL parent (MG-20 or L. burttii). To generate a consensus genotype call pattern for each contig across each RIL population (Gifu × L. burttii and Gifu × MG-20), the most commonly occurring genotype across all positions was selected.2.3. Assembly scaffolding based on genetic maps and Hi-C dataGifu leaf tissue was sent to Phase Genomics (https://phasegenomics.com), where Hi-C sequencing was carried out and a draft proximity-based (Proximo) scaffolding generated. Chromatin conformation capture data were generated using a Phase Genomics (Seattle, WA) Proximo Hi-C.24 Intact cells from two samples were crosslinked using a formaldehyde solution, digested using the Sau3AI restriction enzyme, and proximity ligated with biotinylated nucleotides to create chimeric molecules composed of fragments from different regions of the genome that were physically proximal in vivo, but not necessarily genomically proximal. Molecules were pulled down with streptavidin beads and processed into an Illumina-compatible sequencing library. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NextSeq 500, generating a total of 175,495,827 PE150 read pairs. Reads were aligned to the draft PacBio assembly scaffoldSeq.fasta using bwa mem with the -5 option.22 Alignments were then filtered with SAMtools23 using the -F 2316 filtering flag.Phase Genomics’ Proximo Hi-C genome scaffolding platform was used to create chromosome-scale scaffolds from the draft assembly in a method similar to that described by Bickhart et al.25 As in the LACHESIS method,26 this process computes a contact frequency matrix from the aligned Hi-C read pairs, normalized by the number of Sau3AI restriction sites (GATC) on each contig, and constructs scaffolds in such a way as to optimize expected contact frequency and other statistical patterns in Hi-C data. Approximately 88,000 separate Proximo runs were performed to optimize the number of scaffolds and scaffold construction in order to make the scaffolds as concordant with the observed Hi-C data as possible. This process resulted in a set of six chromosome-scale scaffolds containing 549 Mb of sequence (>99% of the draft assembly). Chimeric contigs were identified based on genetic map, Hi-C, and PacBio coverage data and split. The initial scaffolding was then iteratively improved using genetic map data followed by re-running Proximo scaffolding until genetic map and proximity-based scaffolding results converged.2.4. Genome annotationThe annotation of the Lotus Gifu genome was performed using evidence from transcriptome data as well as homology information from related species. For the homology-based annotation, available Arabidopsis thaliana (Araport11), Glycine max (version 2.1), and Medicago (MtrunA17r5.0-ANR) protein sequences were combined. These protein sequences were mapped to the Lotus Gifu reference genome sequence using the splice-aware alignment tool GenomeThreader27 (version 1.6.6; with the arguments -startcodon -finalstopcodon -species rice -gcmincoverage 70 -prseedlength 7 -prhdist 4). In the expression data-based step, multiple RNA-seq datasets (SRP127678, SRP105404, DRP000629, PRJNA622801) were used as evidence for the genome-guided prediction of gene structures. Therefore, reads from RNA-seq datasets were mapped to the genome using Hisat2 (version 2.1, parameter –dta)28 and subsequently assembled into transcript sequences with Stringtie (version 1.2.3, parameters -m 150 -t -f 0.3).29 Next, Transdecoder (version 3.0.0) (https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder) was used to identify potential open reading frames and predict protein sequences. Using BLASTP (ncbi-blast-2.3.0+, parameters -max_target_seqs 1 -evalue 1e-05),30 the predicted protein sequences were compared against a protein reference database (UniProt Magnoliophyta, reviewed/Swiss-Prot) and used hmmscan (version 3.1b2)31 to identify conserved protein family domains for all proteins. BLAST and hmmscan results were then used by Transdecoder-predict and the best translations per transcript sequence was selected. Finally, results from the two gene prediction approaches were combined and redundant protein sequences were removed. Additionally, some symbiosis genes were manually curated (Supplementary Table S6).In order to classify gene models into complete and functional genes, non-coding transcripts, pseudogenes, and transposable elements, a confidence classification protocol was applied. Candidate protein sequences were compared against the following three databases using BLAST: PTREP, a manually curated database of hypothetical proteins that contains deduced protein sequences, from which frameshifts have mostly been removed (http://botserv2.uzh.ch/kelldata/trep-db/index.html); Fab, a database with annotated proteins from the legumes Glycine max and Medicago; and UniMag, a database of validated proteins from the Magnoliophyta. UniMag protein sequences were downloaded from UniProt and further filtered for complete sequences with start and stop codons. Best hits were selected for each predicted protein to each of the three databases. Only hits with an E-value below 10e-10 were considered. Furthermore, only hits with subject coverage above 80% were considered significant and protein sequences were further classified into high and low confidence. High-confidence (HC) protein sequences are complete and have a subject and query coverage above the threshold in the UniMag database (HC1) or no blast hit in UniMag but in Fab and not PTREP (HC2). While a low-confidence (LC) protein sequence is not complete and has a hit in the UniMag or Fab database but not in PTREP (LC1), or no hit in UniMag and Fab and PTREP but the protein sequence is complete. Functional annotation of transcripts as well as the assignment of GO terms was performed using the tool ‘Automatic assignment of Human Readable Descriptions – AHRD’. AHRD performs BLASTP search against Swiss-Prot, The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR), and TrEMBL databases to perform functional annotation based on homology to other known proteins and integrates domain search results from InterProScan as well as gene ontology (GO) terms.32 Repeats were annotated using RepeatMasker33 version 3.3 with a custom Fabaceae-library in sensitive mode. Non-coding RNAs were predicted using tRNAscan-SE (version 1.3.1),34 RNAmmer (version 1.2),35 and Infernal (version 1.1.2)36 with default parameters. The results were merged subsequently.2.5. Expression atlasRaw Lotus Gifu RNA-seq reads were obtained from either the Sequence Read Archive (SRA) for the listed accessions or generated in this study (Supplementary Table S1). For data in this study, 3-day old Lotus Gifu seedlings were transferred to filter paper covered agar (1.4% agar noble) slants. Roots were treated with M. loti R7A, 6-Benzylaminopurine (BA) (1 µM) or mock and a 1-cm segment of root tissue corresponding to the zone of emerging root hairs at time of treatment was harvested. For nodule tissue, whole nodules were harvested. Libraries were constructed and sequenced by Novogene (Hong Kong) using PE-150bp reads on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 instrument. A decoy-aware index was built for Gifu transcripts using default Salmon parameters and reads were quantified using the –validateMappings flag37 (Salmon version 0.14.1). A normalised expression atlas across all conditions was constructed using the R-package DESeq2 version 1.2038 after summarizing gene level abundance using the R-package tximport (version 1.8.0). Normalized count data obtained from DESeq2 are available in the Lotus Base expression atlas (https://lotus.au.dk/expat/).152.6. Analysis of symbiotic islandsMedicago A17 proteins associated with symbiotic islands as defined by Pecrix et al.,39 were blasted against Lotus Gifu proteins annotated in the present assembly, and the best hit was extracted. It was then determined if there was microsynteny between the Medicago A17 genes in the symbiotic island and the best Lotus Gifu matches (Supplementary File S5). Medicago A17 RNA-seq data (Supplementary Table S2) was trimmed using trimmomatic (10.1093/bioinformatics/btu170), trimmed reads were mapped to the Medicago A17 version 5 reference sequence (MtrunA17r5.0) using the splice aware STAR aligner (version 2.5.1a).40 A read was allowed to map in at most 10 locations (–outFilterMultimapNmax 10) with a maximum of 4% mismatches (–outFilterMismatchNoverLmax 0.04) and all non–canonical intron motifs were filtered out (–outFilterIntronMotifs RemoveNoncanonicalUnannotated). In order to obtain non-unique gene-level counts from the mapping files, HTSeq (version 0.9.1)41 with the ‘nonunique all’-method was used. Normalization of read counts was performed by library sequence depth using the R-package DESeq2 (version 1.23.3).38Log expression ratios of 10 days post inoculation (dpi) nodule samples versus non-inoculated root samples were calculated for Lotus Gifu and Medicago A17 and Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). For calculation of Pearson correlation coefficients, all Medicago A17 RNA-seq samples listed in Supplementary Table S2 were used, while only Lotus Gifu root and nodule samples were used (Supplementary Table S1). When analyzing the largest possible set of genes (Fig. 3B), all Medicago A17 genes with a match to a Lotus Gifu gene anywhere in the genome were included along with one Lotus Gifu match per Medicago A17 gene, allowing many copies of the same Lotus Gifu gene. For analysis of unique Lotus genes, only a single Medicago A17 gene was included per Lotus Gifu match within the microsyntenic region and islands with less than three Lotus Gifu microsyntenic hits were not considered (Fig. 3C). All statistical analyses were carried out using R version 3.4.3. The scripts used for analysis are freely available from GitHub (https://github.com/stiguandersen/LotjaGifuGenome).2.7. Data availabilitySequencing data are available from SRA. PacBio data used for genome assembly and Hi-C data from Phase Genomics used for construction of proximity map (PRJNA498060); Illumina paired-end data from RIL resequencing used for genetic map construction (PRJNA498068); L. burttii genomic DNA reads (PRJNA635235); RNA-seq data used for annotation (PRJNA622801); RNA-seq expression atlas data (PRJNA622396). Assembly pseudomolecules are available from the NCBI nucleotide repository with accession numbers AP022629–AP022637. Pseudomolecule sequences and genome annotation information are also found in Supplementary Files S2 and S3 and are available for browsing and download at Lotus Base (https://lotus.au.dk) and LegumeBase (https://www.legumebase.brc.miyazaki-u.ac.jp) and for synteny comparisons at CoGe (https://genomevolution.org/coge/GenomeInfo.pl?gid=58121).3. Results and data description3.1 A chromosome-scale Lotus Gifu assembly including telo- and centromeric repeatsWe generated a total of 11.8 million PacBio RSII reads, which we assembled using Canu21 into 1,686 contigs with an N50 of 807 kb and a total length of 554 Mb (Table 1). We first scaffolded the contigs using 175 million Proximo Hi-C reads (Phase genomics). To validate the scaffolding, we mapped whole genome re-sequencing data from two RIL populations12 to the PacBio contigs. The vast majority of the assembly, 99.5%, was contained within contigs that had at least one polymorphic SNP marker, leaving only 2.5 Mb of sequence on markerless contigs (Table 1). We compared the Hi-C scaffolding results to the genetic maps generated based on the RIL data (Supplementary File S1) and moved contigs according to genetic linkage. We then repeated the scaffolding until the Proximo Hi-C results were concordant with the genetic maps and the contigs were arranged in six pseudomolecules corresponding to the six Lotus chromosomes (Supplementary File S2). The total length of the assembly was close to the expected genome size of ~500 Mb (Table 1), and we found canonical telomeric repeats at the ends of all pseudomolecules, except for the bottom of chromosome 3, indicating a high completeness of the assembly.

L50: at least 50% of the total length is contained within L50 number of contigs.Regarding the highly repetitive sequences, three 45S rDNA clusters and a 5S rDNA gene cluster were anchored on chromosomes 2, 5, and 6, and on chromosome 2, respectively, consistent with FISH data (Fig. 1A).42 In addition to the regions with a high density of repetitive sequences, corresponding to the pericentromeric regions of each chromosome, small regions with high densities of repetitive sequences were identified within the gene rich regions at the bottom arm of chromosomes 2 and 4 (Fig. 1A). The location of these regions corresponded to the positions of chromosome knobs reported in the previous cytological analyses.42,43 These regions with highly dense repetitive sequences tend to be composed of contigs with short length, and thus a significant number of the sequence gaps (389 out of 1,555) were found in these regions. Despite the relatively high frequency of sequence gaps in these repetitive regions, the Hi-C reads provided sufficient physical linking information to allow scaffolding.(A) Circos diagram displaying heatmaps of the numbers of genes and ncRNAs (100 Mb bins) and bases covered by repetitive elements (10 Mb bins) in the Lotus Gifu genome.

Genome annotationBased on evidence from expression data as well as homology information from related species, 30,243 genes were annotated, 21,778 of which represent HC gene models (Table 2, Supplementary File S3). Using the embryophyta_odb10 lineage 1,584 out of 1,614 (98.2%) complete BUSCO v4 orthologs44 were found in the genome assembly and 1,551 (96.1%), were identified within the annotated gene set (Fig. 1B). The HC gene set had a BUSCO score of 94%. Using AHRD,32 we could assign functional annotations to 29,429 genes (97%). Of these, 70.53% fulfilled all three AHRD quality criteria, 16.85% fulfilled two and 11.8% fulfilled one criterion. We then annotated non-coding RNAs, identifying 2,933 in total that comprised 128 micro RNAs, 851 snoRNAs, 88 tRNAs, 795 rRNAs, and others. In total, gene models covered 156,379,918 bases and coding exons covered 60,649,299 bases of the genome assembly.Genome annotation statisticsHC, high-confidence gene models; LC, low-confidence gene models.Genome annotation statisticsHC, high-confidence gene models; LC, low-confidence gene models.Repetitive elements made up 260,312,827 bases (46.96%) of the genome. Of these, long-terminal repeat retrotransposons accounted for most of the repeat content of the genome (42.51%), followed by DNA transposons and low complexity regions (Fig. 1C). Chromosomes 1, 3, 4, 5, and 6 showed centrally located pericentromeric regions rich in repetitive elements flanked by gene-rich regions (Fig. 1A). In contrast, the centromere of chromosome 2 appeared to be distally located near the top of the chromosome, which also carried a large cluster of rRNA genes (Fig. 1A).3.3. RNA-seq-based expression atlasTo produce a gene expression atlas, publicly available and new RNA-seq data from Lotus Gifu was obtained for 35 conditions across different tissues, symbiotic, and pathogenic interactions (Supplementary Table S1). The conditions available include root hair, nodule primordia, and nodules obtained after inoculation with Mesorhizobium loti R7A and root interactions with microbes across a symbiont-pathogen spectrum;18 root and shoot tissues 3 days after roots were inoculated with M. loti45; root symbiotic susceptible zone treated with cytokinin (1 µM BA) or M. loti R7A (this study); roots inoculated with the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus (AMF), Glomus intraradices46; root, leaf, immature flowers, mature flowers, pods, and seeds (SRA ID: PRJDB2436). Gene-level quantification of the data was normalized across conditions (Supplementary File S4) and is made available through Lotus Base (https://lotus.au.dk/expat/) to provide a readily accessible expression viewer. Well-described nodulation genes showed the expected expression patterns across the conditions represented in the expression atlas (Fig. 2).Expression profiles of known symbiosis genes. Expression values from the Lotus Gifu RNA-seq expression atlas are shown for the indicated genes. A full description of the conditions included is shown in Supplementary Table S1.

The heatmap was generated from https://lotus.au.dk/expat/ using the normalize by row function.3.4 Symbiotic islands are not generally conserved between Lotus and MedicagoRecently, ‘symbiotic islands’ representing clusters of genes that showed co-regulated, symbiosis-related expression profiles were identified in Medicago A17.39 Interestingly, these clusters were rich in long non-coding (lnc) RNAs, and it was proposed that the lncRNAs may be involved in regulating symbiosis-related gene expression. To investigate if the Medicago symbiotic islands were conserved in Lotus, we extracted the best Lotus Gifu BLAST hits against the Medicago A17 genes reported to reside within symbiotic islands (Supplementary File S5). Protein coding genes were generally well conserved and showed high levels of microsynteny, regardless of whether or not they were present in gene islands that showed symbiosis-related differential expression (Table 3). Out of 760 islands, 266 had at least three distinct Lotus Gifu hits in microsyntenic regions, and the region with the largest overlap comprised 12 hits. In contrast, most Medicago A17 lncRNAs had no putative orthologs in the Lotus Gifu genome, and, when identified, they were often not found within the designated microsyntenic region (Table 3). Across all 760 investigated islands, a total of six had two lncRNA hits to the Lotus Gifu microsyntenic region, and no island had more than two.Conservation of symbiotic islands between Lotus and MedicagoMt, Medicago A17; Lj, Lotus Gifu; NRU, nodule versus root upregulated; NRD, nodule versus root downregulated; NRN, nodule versus root not regulated; NDA, nodule development apical zone; NDD, nodule development differentiation zone; NDN, nodule development not regulated.Conservation of symbiotic islands between Lotus and MedicagoMt, Medicago A17; Lj, Lotus Gifu; NRU, nodule versus root upregulated; NRD, nodule versus root downregulated; NRN, nodule versus root not regulated; NDA, nodule development apical zone; NDD, nodule development differentiation zone; NDN, nodule development not regulated.The limited conservation and lack of positional clustering make it unlikely that putative orthologs of Medicago lncRNAs are generally part of symbiotic islands in Lotus. Instead, we looked further into the protein coding genes to determine if their organization into symbiotic islands could be conserved. All 760 islands contain at least one protein coding gene. Out of these, we examined the 443 islands associated with nodule-regulated genes designated ‘Nodule upregulated (NRU)’, ‘Nodule downregulated (NRD)’, and ‘Nodule non-regulated (NRN)’. First, we investigated the level of expression conservation by comparing the expression of Medicago A17 genes in symbiotic islands and their Lotus Gifu syntenic homologs in root and 10 dpi nodule samples (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 and Supplementary Files S4 and S6). The genes associated with Medicago A17 NRU islands showed strongly correlated expression responses in Lotus Gifu and Medicago A17, NRDgenes showed a less pronounced correlation, while there was no correlation for the NRN genes (Fig. 3A).Symbiotic island gene expression.

Lotus: expression data from Lotus Gifu. Medicago: expression data from Medicago A17.To quantify the level of co-regulation within putative symbiotic islands, we calculated the average Pearson correlation coefficients for each island based on the gene expression data from root and nodule samples (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). First, we included all genes in Medicago symbiotic islands that had a Lotus BLAST match anywhere in the genome along with their best Lotus match. If a Lotus gene was the best match for multiple Medicago genes, it was included multiple times in the analysis. Especially for the NRU islands, this resulted in a very pronounced skew towards high correlation coefficients as compared to the NRN islands, and this was true both for Lotus Gifu and Medicago A17 (Fig. 3B).We then repeated the analysis including only Medicago A17–Lotus Gifu syntenic homolog pairs from islands with at least three unique Lotus Gifu genes. That is, if multiple Medicago A17 genes matched the same Lotus Gifu gene, only a single Medicago A17 gene was retained and each unique Lotus Gifu gene was only included once per island. This resulted in a marked reduction in the number of islands and the large peak of near perfect correlation coefficients for NRU islands disappeared for both Lotus Gifu and Medicago A17 (Fig. 3C). Since there was no longer a major difference between the root/nodule-based correlation coefficients between the nodule-regulated NRU and NRD islands and the NRN controls, it appears that local gene amplification in MedicagoA17 is a major cause of the symbiotic island signal. This is consistent with an overall high ratio of Medicago A17 to Lotus Gifu genes in symbiotic islands (Table 3). Symbiotic islands are thus not generally conserved between Lotus and Medicago and are not general features of legume genomes. However, we did find a few examples of gene clusters that showed conserved co-regulation for root and nodule samples (Supplementary Tables S3–S5). In Lotus Gifu, NRU island SRI_NDD0105, which had the second highest Lotus correlation coefficient (Supplementary Table S3), had three very similar copies of a nodulin gene, suggesting that local gene amplification also plays a role here. In contrast, the NRU island with the highest Lotus correlation coefficient (SRI_NRU0026) comprised three very different genes, perhaps warranting further investigation (Supplementary Table S3).4. Conclusion and future perspectivesBy applying long PacBio reads, the contiguity of the assembly was improved compared to the Lotus MG-20 version 3.0 assembly that was a hybrid assembly based on Sanger and Illumina sequences. Using Hi-C paired-end reads and high-density SNP marker information generated by re-sequencing of Lotus Gifu x L. burttii RILs, 1,584 contigs were anchored onto 6 chromosomes with 42 scaffolds, providing a high-quality and well-validated assembly. The number of scaffolds was a bit larger than that of the latest Medicago A17 sequence (Mt5.0) due to manual correction of Hi-C scaffolding errors based on the SNP marker information. Typical Hi-C scaffolding errors were identified in the distal regions of each pseudomolecule and at the border regions of chromosome knobs located on chromosomes 2 and 4, presumably due to an atypical three-dimensional chromosome conformation in those regions. A total of 30,243 high and LC gene models were annotated, which corresponds approximately to the number of HC gene models in the Medicago version 4 assembly (Table 2). The total number of annotated genes is higher for Medicago versions 4 and 5 than for the current Lotus Gifu assembly. However, the number of exons per transcript is markedly lower for the full Medicago A17gene sets than for the Lotus Gifu gene and Medicago A17 version 4 HC gene sets, suggesting that the differences in gene numbers are due to different stringencies in including small genes with few exons. As expected, the paleopolyploid soybean (Glycine max)47 has a higher number of annotated genes than Lotus but retains a similar exon per transcript ratio despite more than 50,000 annotated genes.The availability of a high-quality Lotus Gifu assembly will facilitate further improvements of genetic and genomic Lotus resources. The LORE1 mutant collection, which includes more than 130,000 insertion mutant lines, is in the Lotus Gifu genetic background, but was annotated based on the Lotus MG-20 version 3.0 assembly.14 Using the new Lotus Gifu sequence, the LORE1 insertions can now be more accurately characterized. Likewise, Gifu is more closely related to the majority of the collection of natural Lotus accessions that was recently characterized,10 and the new reference assembly should allow an improved characterization of the genetic diversity. Here, we have mapped existing and new RNA-seq data to the Gifu assembly to provide a consistently normalized and updated Lotus gene expression atlas readily available through Lotus Base.15 The current atlas does not comprise as many samples as previously profiled using microarrays,48,49 but it is not limited by probe set selection and includes data on all annotated and expressed genes.The new assembly and expression atlas also proved useful in interspecific comparisons, since the complete pseudomolecules allowed us to accurately assess synteny with Medicago to investigate the level of conservation of plant symbiotic islands. Interestingly, the recently identified Medicago symbiotic islands did not appear to be conserved in Lotus. This was most evident for the Medicago non-coding RNAs, for which we could find only very few matching sequences in Lotus despite the completeness of the assembly. It should be noted that many of the transcripts classified as lncRNAs in the Medicago study39 in fact encode peptides, most notably the large family of nodule cysteine-rich (NCR) peptides. The NCR peptides are characteristic of the Inverted Repeat Lacking Clade (IRLC) legume lineage and thus not found in Lotus.50 The same appears to be the case for the other transcripts in the non-coding class, indicating that non-coding and peptide-encoding genes have evolved rapidly and are not generally required for legume-rhizobium symbiosis across determinate and indeterminate nodulators. For the protein-coding genes in symbiotic islands, we found much higher levels of conservation and microsynteny, but most of the local co-regulation appeared to be related to tandem gene duplications in Medicago. Generally, Medicago seems to have experienced not only a rapid expansion of NCR peptide genes and lncRNAs involved in symbiosis, but also of protein-coding genes with symbiosis-related expression patterns, and our results clearly indicate that symbiotic islands are not general features of legume genomes.The analysis of symbiotic islands represents only a first use case for the new high-quality Lotus Gifu genomic data, and we anticipate that it will be broadly used in genomics studies. The data will be included in comparative genomics websites such as Phytozome51 and Legume Information System52 and it is already available at CoGe (https://genomevolution.org/coge/GenomeInfo.pl?gid=58121).53 In addition, the high completeness of the assembly and the set of annotated genes makes the data well suited for phylogenomic studies that rely on precise genomic data for large-scale cross-species analyses.54Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.Author contributionsConceptualization, S.U.A., S.S. and K.F.X.M; validation, N.K., S.S., K.F.X.M and S.U.A.; formal analysis, N.K., T.M., D.R., T.Y.A., T.A., H.H., S.S. and SUA; investigation, N.S; resources, J.S., S.S., K.F.X.M., S.U.A.; data curation, N.K., S.S., K.F.X.M and S.U.A.; writing—original draft, S.U.A. and N.K.; writing—review and editing, S.U.A. and N.K. with input from all authors; visualization, N.K., S.U.A. and D.R.; supervision, S.U.A., S.S. and K.F.X.M.; project administration, J.S., S.S., K.F.X.M. and S.U.A.; funding acquisition, J.S., S.S., K.F.X.M. and S.U.A.The work was supported by the Danish National Research Foundation (grant DNRF79 to J.S.), the Genome Information Upgrading Program of the National BioResource Project in 2014 and 2015 (S.S.), a JST CREST (grant JPMJCR16O1 to S.S.), the CRISBAR grant of the German Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) (K.F.X.M.) and grant 10-081677 from The Danish Council for Independent Research | Technology and Production Sciences (S.U.A.).

IntroductionThe Lamiaceae (mint) family is among the largest angiosperm families, containing ~7,000 species that occupy a wide geographic distribution1 and are commonly recognized by their square stems, opposite leaves, and lobed inflorescences. The Lamiaceae is not only rich in species number and diversity, but also in the production of specialized metabolites. The largest class of these metabolites, terpenes, exhibit substantial chemodiversity and broad variation in abundances across Lamiaceae.2,3 Recent molecular-based phylogenetic analyses support 10 - 12 major clades within the mint family, the largest of which is the Nepetoideae that contains approximately half of all Lamiaceae species.3,4 The Nepetoideae also has the greatest diversity of monoterpenes5 among the mint clades, making it a robust clade to study the relationship between terpenoid diversity and species diversity.All terpenoids are derived from two universal precursors, isopentenyl diphosphate (IPP) and its isomer dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP), which are synthesized in plants via two independent pathways: the methylerythriol phosphate (MEP) pathway in the plastid and the mevalonic acid (MVA) pathway distributed among the cytosol endoplasmic reticulum and peroxisomes. IPP and DMAPP then serve as substrates for short-chain prenyltransferases, which produce the prenyl diphosphates, geranyl diphosphate (GPP) in the plastid and farnesyl diphosphate (FPP) in the cytosol. Finally, GPP and FPP are converted into monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, respectively, by the action of enzymes of the terpene synthase (TPS) superfamily. Product promiscuity of TPSs and enzymes modifying TPS products are the main sources of terpene structural diversity in plants.6A number of Nepetoideae species are used as culinary herbs due to their production of specialized metabolites that impart unique flavour profiles. Sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum L.), e.g. exhibits a wide range of phenotypes and chemotypes7 and is commonly used in pesto sauce. Although ploidy varies within O. basilicum, the cultivar ‘Genovese’ is tetraploid (2n = 4x = 48) with a genome size of 4.1 - 4.7 Gb estimated by flow cytometry.8,9 Rosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis L.), in contrast, is an evergreen shrub with grey-green needle-like leaves that emit a strong fragrance due to multiple aromatic volatiles.10,11,Rosmarinus officinalis and its essential oils have been widely used in cultural practices, culinary flavourings, medicinal remedies, and pest deterrents.12 Oregano (Origanum vulgare L.) and sweet marjoram (Origanum majorana L.) are both members of the Origanum genus, having a shrub-like architecture and small, ovate leaves. Their relatedness is evidenced biologically and culturally as Origanum spp. can make interspecific hybridizations13 and some regions of the world refer to oregano and marjoram interchangeably. Young leaves of both Origanum spp. are harvested, dried, ground, and added to culinary dishes to bestow a spicy, bitter-sweet flavour. Three major chemotypes have been described for O. vulgare: acyclic, cymyl, and sabinyl.14 Chemotypes of O. majorana are less-defined due to nomenclature challenges and the presence of distillation artefacts15,16 but both cymyl and sabinyl compounds have been widely documented.17,18All four species were part of the 1k Plant Transcriptome Initiative19,20 and leaf transcriptomes were generated to examine the evolution of green plants as well as for understanding the evolution of chemodiversity within the Lamiaceae.3 In addition, for O. basilicum, transcriptomes were generated for cultivars ‘Tiguillo’ and ‘Red Rubin’21 as well as ‘CIM Saumya’,22 and a genome assembly of the O. basilicum cultivar ‘Perrie’ has recently been reported although the actual sequence is not currently available.23 There is a growing number of Lamiaceae species with assembled genomes (see Supplementary Dataset S1) that have enabled identification of genes involved in specialized metabolism and a broader understanding of genome organization with respect to specialized metabolism.24 However, the genetic repertoire encoding chemical diversity within the culinary herbs remain largely unexplored. Here, we here report the genome sequence, annotation, and metabolite profiling of four culinary herbs and describe their repertoire of terpenoid biosynthetic genes that will provide a resource for data-mining not only terpenoid biosynthetic pathway genes but also other genes that function in specialized metabolism.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and growing conditionsPlant samples for O. basilicum ‘Genovese’ and R. officinalis ‘Arp’ were purchased from VanAtta’s Greenhouse and Flower Shop (Haslett, MI), whereas O. majorana and O. vulgare were obtained from Richter’s Herbs (Canada). Ocimum basilicum and R. officinalis were grown in a growth chamber under a 14-/10-h day/night cycle with a daytime temperature of 27°C and a night-time temperature of 15°C; light intensity in the chamber was 210 µE m-2 s-1. Origanum majorana and O. vulgare were grown in a greenhouse under a 15-/9-h day/night cycle at a temperature of 26.6°C. Plant management included weekly fertilizing and pesticide application as necessary. Flow cytometry was performed on leaf samples at the Benaroya Research Institute (Seattle, WA), and k-mer estimated genome sizes were determined using Jellyfish v2.2.025 with a k-mer size of 31 and adjusted for heterozygous sequences using the R package findGSE v0.1.0.262.2. DNA and RNA isolationNuclei were isolated from leaf tissue following a previously described protocol27 with an input of 1 - 2 g of ground tissue; spin speeds were used based on estimated genome size, 2,700, 3,030, 3,030, and 2,900 g for O. basilicum, O. majorana, O. vulgare, and R. officinalis, respectively. DNA was extracted using the Nanobind Plant Nuclei Big DNA Kit (Circulomics, Baltimore, MD, Cat No. NB-900-801-01). RNA was extracted from mature leaf tissue using a hot phenol protocol,28 and DNA was removed using the TURBO DNA-free™ Kit (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, Cat No. AM1907). Quality and concentrations were verified by Nanodrop, Qubit, and agarose gel electrophoresis.2.3. Library construction, sequencing, and expression abundance estimationGenomic libraries were constructed using 10× Genomics Technology (Chromium™ Genome Library Kit & Gel Bead Kit v2; Pleasanton, CA, USA) and sequenced at the Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Sequencing was performed on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 at 150 nt in paired-end mode. Libraries were pooled with an aim of 65× coverage for each species. RNA-Seq libraries were constructed using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Kit with polyA mRNA selection and IDT for Illumina Unique Dual Index primers (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA) and sequenced at the Michigan State University Research Technology Support Facility. RNA-Seq libraries were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 4,000 at 150 nt in paired-end mode. Reads were cleaned with Cutadapt v2.3,29 which trimmed adapters and 3' bases with a quality score <10, and only kept reads of at least 100 nt. After cleaning, reads were aligned to their respective genomes using HISAT2 v2.1.030 with the following parameters set: –dta-cufflinks, –max-intronlen 5000, and –rna-strandness RF. Cufflinks v2.2.131 was run in stranded mode to generate expression abundances (fragments per kilobase of exon model per million mapped reads).2.4. Genome assembly and annotationThe 10× Genomics reads were demultiplexed and assembled using Supernova v2.1.1,32 with –maxreads set to 900 million, 330 million, 259 million, and 450 million reads for O. basilicum, O. majorana, O. vulgare, and R. officinalis, respectively. Scaffolds containing only N sequences were removed from the final assemblies. Custom repeat libraries (CRL) were generated for each species using RepeatModeler v1.0.8 (http://www.repeatmasker.org; last accessed April 2020) as described previously.33 Genome assemblies were masked with their respective CRLs using RepeatMasker v4.0.6 (http://www.repeatmasker.org; last accessed April 2020). Gene prediction on the masked assembly was performed using Augustus v3.134 with a matrix trained for the Nepetoideae species, Hyssopus officinalis L.35 To refine the gene models, leaf RNA-Seq libraries were cleaned and used to generated genome-guided transcript assemblies using Trinity v2.3.236 with a maximum intron size of 5,000 and a minimum contig length of 500 nt in stranded mode. The genome-guided transcript assemblies were used with PASA2 v2.3.337 to create the working gene model set. To identify high confidence gene models from the working gene model set, the gene models were searched against PFAM v32.038 using HMMER v3.2.1 (hmmer.org) with search cut-offs–domE 1e-3 -E 1e-5, and gene abundances of the leaf RNA-Seq library were calculated using Kallisto v0.46.0.39 Gene models that were not partial models, did not contain an internal stop codon, not transposable element-related, and had a PFAM domain match or a TPM > 0 were selected as high confidence models. Functional annotation of the high confidence gene models was generated as described previously.33 Gene ontology (GO) terms were assigned to the representative high confidence gene models using IPRscan v5.34.73.0.402.5. Genome sequence and annotation quality assessmentTo assess the completeness of the assembly, whole genome shotgun libraries were processed using Cutadapt v2.329 and reads were aligned to their respective assemblies with BWA-MEM v0.7.16a.41Paired-end RNA-Seq libraries constructed from leaf tissue were aligned to the assemblies using HISAT2 v2.1.030 using stranded mode with a maximum intron length of 5,000 bp. Coverage of the genic space was assessed using BUSCO v3.0.2b42,43 with the Embryophyta odb9 dataset (creation date: 2016-02-13, number of species: 30, number of BUSCOs: 1,440) to detect conserved orthologs in the assemblies.2.6. Extraction and analysis of terpenoids by gas chromatography-mass spectrometryThe same leaf tissue harvested for RNA extraction was used for terpenoid profiling. Tissue from each species (0.2 g) was ground in liquid nitrogen and extracted overnight with shaking at room temperature with 5 ml of dichloromethane containing 6.6 µg of the internal standard naphthalene. After centrifugation, the solvent containing the extracted metabolites was transferred to a new glass tube and concentrated to ~180 µl under nitrogen gas.44 Subsequently, gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis was performed on an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (Agilent Technologies) equipped with a HP-5MS column (30 m, 0.25 mm, 0.25 µm; Agilent Technologies) and coupled to an Agilent 5975B insert MSD quadrupole mass spectrometer (Agilent Technologies). Each sample (2 µl) was injected at a pulsed splitless mode at 250 °C. The column temperature was held at 50 °C for 2 min, followed by increased to 320 °C at 20 °C min-1, and held at 320 °C for 4.5 min. Helium was applied as a carrier gas at a flow rate of 1 ml min-1. MS ionization energy was set at 70 eV, and the mass spectrum was scanned from 50 to 300 amu. Three biological replicates were used for metabolite profile analysis for each species. Compounds were identified by comparing retention times and mass spectra with those of commercially available authentic standards including a-pinene, ß-pinene, a-phellandrene, a-terpinene, cis-ß-ocimene, <U+03B3>-terpinene, terpinolene, linalool, geraniol, ß-caryophyllene, and caryophyllene oxide as well as by comparing mass spectra to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Mass Spectral Library v2.2. Quantification of terpenoids was performed using the Mass Hunter quantitative software (Agilent Technologies, v. B. 07.01) using response factors relative to the internal standard determined experimentally for the commercially available authentic standards a-pinene (representative monoterpene for a-thujene, a-pinene, camphene), ß-pinene (representative monoterpene for ß-pinene and ß-myrcene), a-phellandrene (representative monoterpene for a-phellandrene and ß-phellandrene), a-terpinene (representative monoterpene for a-terpinene, <U+03B3>-terpinene, o-cymene, cis-ß-ocimene, terpinolene), geraniol (representative monoterpene alcohol), ß-caryophyllene (representative sesquiterpene), and nerolidol (representative sesquiterpene alcohol) and normalized to the fresh weight of the tissue.2.7. Comparative genome analysesRepresentative peptides from teak (Tectona grandis L.f.)33 and Arabidopsis thaliana Col-045 were included in comparative genome analysis as outgroups for Nepetoideae and Lamiaceae, respectively. Predicted teak peptides were downloaded from GigaDB (http://dx.doi.org/10.5524/100550) on 26 November 2019 and A. thaliana peptides were downloaded from Araport11 on 13 November 2019. Orthofinder2 v2.3.746 was run using default settings to identify orthologous and paralogous TPSs in each species. Orthologous groups represented by all species were used to construct and root a consensus species tree with the STAG47 and STRIDE48 algorithms, respectively. Gene family expansion and contraction were determined with CAFE v4.2.149 using default settings and an ultrametric tree rooted at 125 million years ago based on estimates from multiple studies.50–53 Enrichment of GO terms was performed using the Bioconductor package TopGO v2.38.1.542.8. Identification of TPS orthologsManually reviewed cloned TPS genes from Lamiaceae were retrieved from SwissProt (Supplementary Table S1). TPSs were selected to include species within and outside the Nepetoideae subfamily of interest, as well as discrete clades within the Nepetoideae. Lamiaceae TPSs were used along with annotated A. thaliana TPSs to identify putative orthologs in the predicted proteomes of the four culinary herbs.2.9. Data availabilityRaw sequences are available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive under BioProject PRJNA592145. Large files associated with the genomes including genome sequence, annotation, gff, and expression matrices are available in the Dryad Digital Repository under doi https://doi.org/10.5061/dryad.jwstqjq6t.3. Results and discussion3.1. Genome assembly and annotationFlow cytometry of the four culinary herbs revealed estimated haploid genome sizes consistent with previous studies. The flow cytometry haploid genome estimation of the tetraploid O. basilicum var. ‘Genovese’ was 2.34 Gb which is within previous estimates of 2.04 Gb8 to 2.37 Gb.9 The flow cytometry estimate of haploid genome size for O. majorana (880.2 Mb) is comparable to a recent estimate of 846 Mb,55 and estimates for O. vulgare (694.38 Mb) and R. officinalis (1198.05 Mb) are remarkably similar to previously published flow cytometrical estimates of 684.6 Mb56 and 1198.05 Mb,57 respectively. The k-mer estimated genome sizes for O. basilicum, O. majorana, O. vulgare, and R. officinalis were 2.15 Gb, 760.95, 665.08, and 1013.85 Mb, respectively (Supplementary Table S2 and Fig. S1); overall, estimation of genome sizes between flow cytometry and k-mer frequency were comparable. We utilized Supernova32 to assemble the genomes of the four species. As shown in Table 1, reconstituted molecule lengths ranged from 36.91 kb (O. vulgare) to 83.47 kb (R. officinalis). Assembled contig N50 lengths ranged from 21.82 kb (R. officinalis) to 48.30 kb (O. basilicum), while scaffold N50s ranged from 368.74 kb (R. officinalis) to 1.51 Mb (O. basilicum). The GC content of the assemblies varied from 38.12% (R. officinalis) to 40.32% (O. vulgare). Detection of heterozygous SNPs by the Supernova assembly process ranged from 192 to 1,490 bp in R. officinalis and O. basilicum, respectively. For the final genome assembly, scaffolds <10 kb were removed resulting in final assembly sizes of O. basilicum (2.07 Gb), R. officinalis (1.01 Gb), O. majorana (760.89 Mb), and O. vulgare (630.04 Mb).Assembly metrics of four culinary herbsCarovic-Stanko et al.8Rice et al.58Assembly metrics of four culinary herbsCarovic-Stanko et al.8Rice et al.58Although the Supernova assembler was originally designed for human genomics applications, it has been used to assemble non-human animal species like perch59 and rice coral,60 as well as diploid plant species such as pepper,61 snowberry,62 and maize.63 Supernova assemblies have been generated for polyploid species including proso millet (Panicum miliaceum), an allotetraploid,63 and potato (Solanum tuberosum subsp. andigena), an autopolyploid.64 Our successful assembly of O. basilicum further supports the use of Supernova to generate quality assemblies of polyploid species.To assess the completeness and representation of genic sequences, whole genome shotgun and RNAseq reads were aligned to their cognate genome assembly. At least 95.8% of whole genome shotgun reads aligned to the assemblies (Supplementary Table S3); properly paired reads with correct orientation ranged from 79.0% (R. officinalis) to 85.1% (O. basilicum). Leaf RNA-Seq reads had overall alignment rates ranging from 82.7% (O. basilicum) to 89.4% (O. majorana) (Supplementary Table S4). BUSCO analysis of the O. majorana, O. vulgare, and R. officinalis assemblies revealed 89.5 - 90.1% complete orthologs while the O. basilicum assembly contained 86.7% of complete orthologs (Table 2). Approximately half of the O. basilicum orthologs were present as multiple copies, consistent with its tetraploidy.8Representation of genic space in four culinary herb genome assemblies as revealed through Benchmarking Single Copy Orthologs (BUSCO)aSimão et al.43; Waterhouse et al.42Representation of genic space in four culinary herb genome assemblies as revealed through Benchmarking Single Copy Orthologs (BUSCO)aSimão et al.43; Waterhouse et al.42Of the species assembled in this study, a previous assembly was reported for O. basilicum cultivar, ‘Perrie’23 while the present study assembled the cultivar ‘Genovese’. Both cultivars are tetraploid (2n = 4x = 48) yet flow cytometry estimates of haploid genome size differ; ‘Perrie’ was estimated at 1.59 Gb,59 while our flow cytometry estimate of ‘Genovese’ was 2.34 Gb is in agreement with previous estimations8,9 and estimated size using k-mer frequency as well as from the Supernova programme. The ‘Perrie’ assembly was 2.13 Gb and the ‘Genovese’ assembly size generated in this study was 2.07 Gb; these differences may reflect variation in genome size among and within Ocimum spp.8 as well as the level of heterozygosity in the sequenced genomes. Dudai et al.23 report ‘Perrie’ as highly homozygous while our ‘Genovese’ sample was heterozygous. The ‘Genovese’ N50 contig length was slightly larger than the Dudai et al. ‘Perrie’ assembly (48.30 - 45.71 kb, respectively), although the N50 scaffold size was substantially smaller (1.51 - 19.30 Mb) (Supplementary Table S5). Assessment of genic completeness using 1,440 BUSCO genes revealed 93.0 and 86.7% of complete genes in ‘Perrie’ and ‘Genovese’, respectively; however, our ‘Genovese’ assembly contained 30.5% of these genes as single-copy compared with 18.5% for the ‘Perrie’ assembly.The four genomes were annotated using the gene finder Augustus34 and the resulting gene models were refined with PASA237 using the genome-guided transcript assemblies. The initial working gene model sets were filtered for high confidence genes using expression evidence and/or PFAM domains, resulting in high confidence gene models for O. basilicum (n = 78,990), O. majorana (n = 33,929), O. vulgare (n = 32,623), and R. officinalis (n = 51,389) (Supplementary Table S6). The annotation data sets were assessed for completeness using BUSCO, revealing a high proportion of complete single copy orthologs. Specifically, single copy orthologs were considered complete in the high confidence representative gene model set at frequencies of 88.3% (O. basilicum), 90.6% (O. majorana), 89.7% (O. vulgare), and 89.2% (R. officinalis). As expected, the tetraploid O. basilicum gene model sets contained substantially more duplicated orthologs compared with the three other diploid species.Repeat-masking was performed on the culinary herb genome assemblies to mask repetitive elements (Supplementary Table S7). The proportion of masked bases was not dependent on genome assembly size, as R. officinalis (54.7%) and O. basilicum (61.6%) had a similar proportion of masked bases compared with O. majorana (65.5%) and O. vulgare (65.4%). Long terminal repeats (LTRs) were the most common repetitive elements, though the proportion of LTRs varied among the culinary herbs. LTRs represented 31.6% of the R. officinalis assembly compared with 47.8 and 49.3% of the O. majorana and O. vulgare assemblies. DNA elements were the second-most common classified element and represented 3.9% of the O. vulgare assembly up to 5.3% of the R. officinalis assembly. The proportion of long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs) identified in the assemblies ranged from 0.28% (O. majorana) to 1.2% (O. vulgare). Instead, O. majorana had noticeably higher amounts of short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) identified (n = 3,469) compared with the other assemblies containing 209, 420, and 600 SINEs for R. officinalis, O. basilicum, and O. vulgare, respectively. The number of satellite repeats was associated with assembly size, though they did not represent >1.1% of the assembly size in any culinary herb.3.2. Mono- and sesqui-terpene profiles of culinary herbsAs terpenoids are produced primarily in the leaves,60 metabolite profiling of leaf terpenoids from the four species was performed by GC-MS (Fig. 1). Spectrometric analyses revealed that these plants produce both monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes, with monoterpenes contributing to a higher degree (Supplementary Table S8). A total of 25 different monoterpenes were identified with only ß-myrcene produced in all cultivars. Ten monoterpenes were species-specific (e.g. carvacrol was found only in O. vulgare), while the others, such as <U+03B3>-terpinene, were shared by two or three species. The highest monoterpene diversity was detected in R. officinalis, which produced 17 monoterpenes, while the other cultivars synthesized 10 - 11 compounds. The total amounts of produced monoterpenes also varied between the species, ranging from 8.99 µmol g FW-1 in O. vulgare to just 0.52 µmol g FW-1 in O. majorana (Supplementary Table S8). The obtained metabolic profiles were generally consistent with literature reports.61–64Terpenoid profiles in four culinary herbs.

Leaf tissue from four culinary herbs was subjected to targeted metabolite profiling. Terpenoid levels are the average of three replicates, measured in nmol per gram of fresh weight. (A) Distribution of metabolites including carvacrol. (B) Distribution of metabolites excluding carvacrol.In contrast to rich chemical diversity observed for monoterpenes, the amount and spectrum of sesquiterpenes was significantly lower. A total of eleven sesquiterpenes were detected, five of which were unique to a single species. There was no sesquiterpene shared by all four species, although ß-caryophyllene was produced by three species. While O. basilicum produced the most diverse spectrum of sesquiterpenes, the highest amount of sesquiterpenes was found in O. vulgare, suggesting that this species is the highest producer of both mono- and sesquiterpenes. Comparative analysis of the most abundant compounds revealed that in species with relatively high levels of terpenoids, O. vulgare and R. officinalis, these are mostly monoterpenes, while in low terpene producers, such as O. basilicum and O. majorana, sesquiterpenes contribute to the overall terpenoid profile. This analysis also revealed that the spectra of most abundant compounds are mostly species-specific (Fig. 2).Unique terpenoid profiles in leaf tissue of four culinary herbs. The five most detected terpenoids are indicated for each culinary herb, and remaining terpenoids are classified as ‘Other’.

Orthologous and paralogous clusteringOrthofinder2 is a software programme that partitions genes according to their phylogenetic ancestry46 and clusters them into orthologous (orthogroups) and paralogous clusters. Identification and comparison of orthologs within orthogroups may reveal gene duplication or loss over evolutionary time. Thus, we performed this type of analysis for the four Nepetoideae species used in this study along with two additional species included in the analysis as outgroups. Tectona grandis (teak) was used as a non-Nepetoideae Lamiaceae species along with the model species A. thaliana, a member of the Brassicaceae. High confidence representative predicted peptides for these six species, along with curated Lamiaceae TPS obtained from SwissProt, were used as input for Orthofinder2; in total, 219,047 predicted peptides were included. Of these, 200,920 (91.7%) were assigned to 25,660 orthogroups (Fig. 3A;Supplementary Dataset S2).Orthologous relationships between four culinary herbs.

Changes to gene family sizes for each lineage are indicated by pie charts, where green indicates expansion, blue indicates neutrality, and red indicates contraction.Orthogroup occupancy by species was similar for the Lamiaceae species, ranging from 65.5% (T. grandis) to 76.6% (O. basilicum), while orthologous genes from the non-Lamiaceae outgroup A. thaliana were only present in 53.9% of orthogroups. A rooted species tree47,48 revealed a topology in agreement with a previous Lamiaceae cladogram (Fig. 3B).3 As expected, O. majorana and O. vulgare were closely related, and teak and A. thaliana were more distantly related to the rest of the Nepetoideae species.In total, 10,407 orthologous groups contained orthologs from all 6 species (Supplementary Dataset S2). Genes in these groups were enriched in core biological processes and molecular function such as translation (GO : 0006412; p < 1e-30), intracellular protein transport (GO: 0006886; p < 1e-30), and structural constituent of ribosome (GO: 0003735; p < 1e-30). Lamiaceae members shared 2,368 orthologous groups containing genes involved in oxidation-reduction (GO: 0055114; p < 1e-30), protein phosphorylation (GO: 0006468; p < 1e-30), regulation of transcription (GO: 0006355; p < 1e-30), defence response (GO: 0006952; p < 1e-30), and TPS activity (GO: 0010333; p = 2.3e-13), among others. Of the orthologous genes unique to the culinary herbs and their singletons (Supplementary Table S9), the most-significant biological processes were recognition of pollen (GO: 0048544; p = 1.5e-28) and translation (GO: 0006412; p = 3.6e-06). These genes were associated with cellular locations such as the ribosome (GO: 0005840; p = 1.7e-07) and nucleosome (GO: 0000786; p = 0.00056). The most significant molecular functions for this subset of genes were protein serine/threonine kinase activity (GO: 0004674; p = 7.3e-16), ADP binding (GO: 0043531; p = 1.2e-14), and TPS activity (GO: 0010333; p = 5.80e-11). Considering that divalent metal cofactors have been shown to influence TPS activity and specificity,65,66 other notably enriched terms among the culinary herb-specific orthologous genes included magnesium ion binding (GO: 0000287; p = 5.6e-05), manganese ion binding (GO: 0030145; p = 0.00068), and copper ion binding (GO: 0005507; p = 0.00994).3.4. Gene family analysisOf the 25,660 orthologous groups identified by the Orthofinder analysis, 12,615 were inferred to be present in the most recent common ancestor and were used in the CAFE analysis along with the ultrametric tree. The number of gene families in the observed Lamiaceae species was found to be generally consistent over evolutionary time (Fig. 3C). Compared with the rest of the culinary herbs, a noticeable gene family contraction occurred in the Origanum genus, while O. basilicum shows significant gene family expansion, likely due in part to its tetraploidy. Both non-Nepetoideae outgroups share a similar number and proportion of contracted gene families.To better understand evolutionary relationships of these four culinary herbs among the ever-growing list of sequenced Lamiaceae spp., we conducted an Orthofinder analysis for all available Lamiaceae predicted proteomes (Supplementary Dataset S1 and Fig. S2), characterizing 34,998 orthologous groups. Approximately 30% of the orthologous groups contained at least one ortholog from each species. Intra-genus orthologous groups for the Origanum spp. and Nepeta spp. contained the second- and third-most number of non-encompassing intersections. Orthologs from Pogostemon cablin, an octoploid, were represented in the most orthologous groups. The species tree derived from ancestral gene families was in agreement with previous cladograms,3,4,67 confirming the monophyly of Nepetoideae subfamily and the polyphyly of the Salvia genus, as described previously.683.5. Identification of precursor genes and TPS in four culinary herbsTerpenes are synthesized from common IPP and DMAPP precursors via the MEP and MVA pathways. To examine the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway in the culinary herbs, orthologous groups were queried for genes belonging to A. thaliana MEP and MVA pathways, as identified previously (Supplementary Table S10).3 All 22 of these A. thaliana MEP/MVA genes clustered into 17 orthologous groups (Supplementary Table S11). Six additional A. thaliana genes also clustered with the MEP/MVA orthogroups OG0001733 and OG0006021, representing five geranylgeranyl phosphate synthases and a putative 1-deoxyxylulose 5-phosphate synthase, respectively. A total of 148 culinary herb orthologs were present among the MEP/MVA orthologous groups. In 13 of the 17 orthogroups, each culinary herb contained equal to or greater numbers of orthologs than A. thaliana. However, the difference in the number of MEP/MVA orthologs across all species was small as each culinary herb contained one to ten MEP/MVA orthologs, compared with one to six orthologs in A. thaliana and one to three orthologs in T. grandis (Fig. 4A).Orthologous gene clusters in the terpenoid biosynthetic pathway.

Orthologous groups specific to A. thaliana are shown to the right of the red divider line; singletons are denoted by an ‘*’ following the gene ID.TPS enzymes synthesize terpenoids from the GPP and FPP end products of the MEP and MVA pathways. To identify TPS genes in the four culinary herbs, orthogroup occupancy of previously published A. thaliana TPSs3 as well as curated Lamiaceae TPSs was investigated. The A. thaliana TPSs (n = 34) belong to TPS subfamilies TPSa, TPSb, TPSc, TPSe/f, and TPSg; these genes clustered into 12 orthologous groups and 6 singletons (Table 3; Supplementary Table S12). Six of the 12 orthologous groups containing A. thaliana TPSs were unique to A. thaliana; the other 6 orthologous groups contained a total of 151 putative TPSs from the four culinary herbs. Curated Lamiaceae TPSs (n = 26) were also included in the analyses to identify Lamiaceae-specific TPSs (Supplementary Table S1); these ‘bait’ Lamiaceae TPS genes clustered into 7 orthologous groups containing a total of 212 putative TPS across the culinary herbs (Table 3). Within these orthogroups, O. basilicum contained the most TPSs (n = 128) of the culinary herbs, followed by R. officinalis (n = 35), O. vulgare (n = 26), and O. majorana (n = 23). In these same orthogroups, 57 orthologs from T. grandis were detected along with 8 orthologs from A. thaliana. Orthologous groups OG0000008, OG0000079, and OG0001915 contained TPSs from both A. thaliana and Lamiaceae bait TPSs, representing TPS subfamilies TPSa, TPSb, and TPSc, respectively.Orthogroup occupancy of Arabidopsis thaliana and Lamiaceae terpene synthase genesGenes below the line were unique to A. thaliana.Orthogroup occupancy of Arabidopsis thaliana and Lamiaceae terpene synthase genesGenes below the line were unique to A. thaliana.Overall, the culinary herb genomes encoded a total of 235 putative TPS occupying ten orthologous groups with TPS from A. thaliana or the Lamiaceae bait. Nearly four to five times as many TPSs were found in O. basilicum (n = 137) compared with the diploid culinary herbs that contained substantially fewer TPSs: R. officinalis (n = 38), O. vulgare (n = 33), O. majorana (n = 27) (Fig. 4B). Consistent with the relatively high levels and rich chemical diversity of monoterpenes in these culinary herbs (Supplementary Table S8), these TPSs were mainly represented by members of the TPSb subfamily, which includes most of the angiosperm monoterpene synthases.69Among the six orthogroups jointly occupied by A. thaliana TPSs and culinary herb orthologs, five orthogroups contained Lamiaceae orthologs in the same or greater quantity than the A. thaliana TPSs (Table 3). Whereas A. thaliana contained one to six orthologs in both the MVA/MEP and TPS related orthogroups, the culinary herbs generally contained more TPS orthologs compared with MEP/MVA orthologs (Fig. 4; Supplementary Table S11). For example, orthogroup OG0000008 contained six A. thaliana TPSs, all belonging to the TPSb subfamily, while all other mint species were represented by 12 (O. majorana and R. officinalis) to 38 (O. basilicum) orthologs. In OG0000079, a single A. thaliana sesquiterpene synthase gene, TPS21 (AT5G23960) was present along with one and two orthologs in O. majorana and O. vulgare, respectively, and 32 orthologs in O. basilicum. However, this trend did not hold for all orthologous groups. For example, the highest number of orthologs in orthogroups OG0003155 (n = 7) and OG0001915 (n = 4) belonged to T. grandis; the A. thaliana TPSs in these orthogroups were associated with TPSe/f and TPSc subfamilies, respectively. Lineage-specific A. thaliana TPS orthogroups included OG0016169 (n = 5), OG0018766 (n = 3), OG0018926 (n = 3), OG0020906 (n = 2), OG0020971 (n = 2), and OG0021104 (n = 2) in addition to the six singletons.3.6. Physical clustering of specialized metabolite pathwaysPhysical clustering within the genome has been reported for numerous specialized metabolism biosynthetic pathways,70 thus to identify putative clusters of enzymes involved in secondary metabolite synthesis, plantiSMASH v1.0 analysis71 was performed on each culinary herb genome assembly with its high confidence representative gene set (Supplementary Table S13). The quantity and classification of clusters detected varied by species. In total, there were 104 clusters detected in O. basilicum, 36 clusters detected in O. majorana, 38 clusters detected in O. vulgare, and 22 clusters detected in R. officinalis. In particular, the four species were enriched in clusters related to terpene and saccharide production. Among the culinary herbs, the most terpene clusters were found for the O. basilicum assembly, with 226 genes located across 24 clusters. The O. majorana and O. vulgare assemblies contained eight and nine terpene clusters, with 65 and 83 corresponding genes, respectively. The smallest number of terpene clusters was found in R. officinalis, with 26 genes in 2 clusters. In comparison, A. thaliana had 7 putative terpene clusters containing 129 genes, and T. grandis had 6 clusters with 72 genes. Other secondary metabolite clusters were represented by a combination of terpene-related genes along with other secondary metabolites such as alkaloids, lignans, and polyketides.4. ConclusionPlants in the mint family are used worldwide for their unique chemical profiles conferred by specialized metabolites such as terpenoids. In this study, we focussed on four mint species commonly utilized as culinary herbs: O. basilicum, O. majorana, O. vulgare, and R. officinalis. Genome sequencing, assembly, and annotation of these herbs revealed a diversity of genes involved in terpenoid biosynthesis. In addition, targeted metabolic profiling revealed the diversity of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes in these species and exemplified unique terpenoid profiles for each species. Our study showcases the genomic and metabolomic characterization of these four herbs that can be used to further explore terpene biosynthesis.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.We thank Brieanne Vaillancourt with her assistance in sequence data management.FundingFunding for work on specialized metabolism was provided in part by a grant to C.R.B. and N.D. from the United States National Science Foundation (IOS-1444499), the United States Department of Agriculture Hatch Act (C.R.B), and the United States Department of Agriculture National Institute of Food and Agriculture Hatch Project number 177845 (N.D.).Accession numbersNational Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive under BioProject PRJNA592145.Authors’ contributionsC.R.B. and N.D. conceived the study.

Origin of genomic diversity in barleyBefore barley (Hordeum vulgare ssp. vulgare) was domesticated, hunter–gatherers used the ancestral wild form (H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum) of domesticated barley as a human food source. Both wild and domesticated barley were found in archaeological sites in the Fertile Crescent dating back about 10,000 years,1 which is believed to be the origin of barley domestication. Wild barley kernels can be distinguished from those of domesticated barley by their brittle and smooth rachis.2 The ancestral wild form of barley shares the same genome as domesticated barley and is classified as a barley subspecies.3 Millions of generations of this wild barley provide a source of diversity to the present-day cultivated form, although domestication partially narrowed the diversity. Soon after domestication, mutations responsible for agronomically valuable traits, such as the jump from two to six row spike,4 spring growth habit,5 and hull-less caryopsis,6 were selected for and spread quickly to all cultivated barley within a few thousand years. Allelic diversity at these loci corresponds with ecological conditions and with different uses of the cereal (human food, animal feed, and malt production) and made barley landraces well suited for cultivation throughout the world in most conditions, except in the tropics. Naturally occurring diversity in locally adapted landraces was the only source of available diversity until barley crossbreeding and mutation induction started in the early 20th century.72. Relationships of plant species within the Poaceae familyBarley ranks fourth among grain cereals (Poaceae species) after maize (Zea mays), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and rice (Oryza sativa) in terms of global production. Barley is self-pollinating with a diploid genome consisting of seven chromosomes (2n = 2x = 14). Barley, common wheat, rye (Secale cereale), and their wild relatives (e.g. Aegilops spp.) are closely related and are included in the Triticeae tribe, which evolved some 12 million years ago within the Pooideae subfamily of the Poaceae (grasses).8 The estimated barley genome size is 5.1 Gbp9 with >80% of repetitive elements. Each sub-genome of hexaploid wheat is characterized by the same genetic components as barley in terms of genome size, gene content, and repetitive elements.10 Although it has a large genome, barley can be considered a good genomic model for cultivated hexaploid wheat due to its simple diploid genome. Large differences in genome sizes exist among Poaceae species. Both Brachypodium distachyon (272 Mbp) and rice (430 Mbp) have small genomes and share a common ancestor with the Triticeae tribe, with divergence times of 32–39 and 40–53 million years ago, respectively.11 Their evolutionary relationships reflect the sequence similarity within Poaceae species and facilitate the identification of orthologous genes of importance across crop genomes. Among Poaceae species, barley has been well studied genetically. Several mutant traits have practical importance and can be used as model traits in cereal crops. In particular, many barley and wheat genes exhibit similar functions: information about a gene in barley can therefore be readily applicable to estimating the genes responsible for similar traits in wheat.3. Genetic and genomic resources3.1. Seed collection for barleyBarley is the only cultivated species of the genus Hordeum, which includes about 32 species and about 45 taxa.3 More than 485,000 accessions for the genus Hordeum are preserved at more than 200 different institutions worldwide.12 These collections include 299,165 accessions of H. vulgare ssp. vulgare (primarily new and old cultivars and landraces), 32,385 accessions of H. vulgare ssp. spontaneum, 4,681 accessions of wild species, and a substantial representation of genetic stocks, breeding lines, and mapping populations.13 Many accessions are duplicated between gene banks for safety or to avoid quarantine problems. The world’s largest seed storage facility is the Svalvard Seed Vault, which preserves over 1 million crop-related accessions, including 92,075 Hordeum accessions as of July 2020 (https://www.nordgen.org/sgsv/). As an East Asian Center of barley genetic resources, Okayama University maintains 10,980 cultivars and landraces, 2,498 genetic stocks, and 628 wild barleys. Their collection, preservation, and distribution are partly supported by the National Bioresource Project (nbrp.jp). These materials have been collected since the 1940s for crop evolutionary studies at Okayama University. About 5,300 cultivated barley accessions have been intensively characterized both by genomic markers and for some agronomically relevant traits, such as resistance to powdery mildew. The data sets are available online from Barley DB (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/barley/).These collections are part of the South and East Asian subset of the international barley core collection, which constitutes the entire ex situ (stored) barley genetic diversity. Okayama University is responsible for the distribution of the South and East Asian subset, comprising 380 accessions. Other materials can be requested from the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) small grain collection (Americas), the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA, West Asia and North Africa and ssp. spontaneum), Leibniz-Institut für Pflanzengenetik und Kulturpflanzenforschung (IPK, Germany), and the Nordic Genetic Resource Center in Sweden (for wild Hordeum).Barley has been the subject of much mutation research and breeding. These mutants have been mainly collected at the USDA small grain collection, located in Aberdeen, Idaho, USA, and at the Nordic Genetic Resource Center, in Alnarp, Sweden.14 To enhance the utility and accessibility of these mutants, >400 mutant alleles have been introgressed into the cultivar Bowman.15 Information on the Bowman introgression lines is available in the Barley Genetics Newsletter, Vol. 26 (http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ggpages/bgn/26/bgn26tc.html). These historical mutants provide a rich resource for functional studies and gene cloning.Okayama University also maintains mutants, tetraploid lines, linkage testers, and near isogenic lines for barley. These lines were largely developed through the research activities at Okayama University and used for the development of linkage maps and genetic analysis of mutant traits.15 Tetraploids helped to develop a series of trisomic lines that can be used to identify the chromosome location of a given locus of interest. Currently, three mapping populations16–18 have been deposited from the North American barley genome mapping project. Another mapping population (Haruna Nijo × H602) was developed at Okayama University.19 These populations were instrumental in developing molecular genetic maps for barley and are being exploited for high-throughput mapping by single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. Recombinant chromosome substitution lines (backcross introgression lines) are also useful resources to identify genes in specific genomic regions to precisely study and map a locus of interest. Several sets of populations are available for distribution.20,213.2. Genomic resourcesMultiple genomic resources have been developed to analyse partial or total genomic sequences and their associated functions in barley.Since 2000, several large barley expressed sequence tag (EST) projects have generated large numbers of sequences from expressed genes (http://harvest.ucr.edu/). Eight different genotypes provided the material for these projects. The polymorphisms identified between genotypes contributed to promoting high-throughput SNP genotyping, genetic mapping, and marker generation. The first comprehensive barley full-length cDNA (FL-cDNA) sequences were collected by Sato et al.22 mRNA samples were isolated from 15 organs and treatments from the Haruna Nijo cultivar and later pooled to develop a FL-cDNA library using the Cap-trapper method.23 A total of 5,006 clones were sequenced (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/barley/). Another set of about 25,000 clones was generated and sequenced from the same cultivar, from 40 different organs and treatments.24 These sequences have allowed the annotation of genes on contigs25 or chromosome-scale genome sequences.26,27Barley geneticists have developed high-quality genetic maps, based on mutant phenotypes, using classical three-point linkage tests.15 These efforts are being updated and complemented with genome-wide genetic maps generated from molecular markers. Stein et al.28 developed a consensus barley map with 1,032 EST-based loci assayed using a combination of marker assays. Sato et al.19 developed a high-resolution barley EST map with 2,890 loci using a single-mapping population. High-throughput and high-quality multiplex PCR-based genotyping assays based on Golden Gate technology (Illumina Inc., CA, USA) involve the allele-specific detection of SNPs. A consensus genetic linkage map containing >2,900 gene-based SNP markers has been developed (http://harvest.ucr.edu/).29,30Several bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) libraries have been constructed. The first library was developed from the Morex cultivar31; it has been joined by other five Morex BAC libraries that collectively cover >25 genome equivalents.32 A library from the cultivar Haruna Nijo consists of 294,912 clones with an average insert size of 115.2 kbp and a coverage of about 6.6 genome equivalents.33 Another BAC library from wild barley accession H602 was developed at Okayama University (unpublished). Libraries from Haruna Nijo (coded as HNB) and H602 are available from the National Bioresource Project (nbrp.jp).4. Genome sequencing4.1. The nuclear genomeThe International Barley Genome Sequencing Consortium (IBSC) was established in 2006 to generate a high-quality barley genome sequence.34 Two general approaches have been undertaken for the analysis of genome structure in barley: (i) identifying a minimum tiling path of 87,075 genetically mapped BAC clones and sequencing these clones (BAC-by-BAC strategy) and (ii) performing whole-genome shotgun sequencing.The development of a BAC-based physical map for genome sequencing is a large-scale and worldwide effort. Madishetty et al.35 developed a high-throughput approach to use overgo probes to identify gene-containing BAC clones. They used >10,000 overgo probes derived from EST sequences to identify 83,381 gene-containing clones from the initial Morex BAC library.31 Fingerprinting of these clones resulted in contigs that comprise roughly two-thirds of all barley genes. Four new Morex BAC libraries have been prepared that cover an estimated 25 haploid genome equivalents.34 From these libraries, approximately 550,000 clones (covering about 14 genome equivalents) have been fingerprinted and assembled in contigs.32 To complement these efforts, BAC-end sequencing will be conducted on 350,000 BACs. In addition, there are efforts to integrate the resulting BAC contigs with the SNP-based genetic maps. Thus, a robust BAC-based physical map was integrated with the genetic map.Of the 5.10 Gbp of the barley genome, IBSC developed a physical map of 4.98 Gbp, with more than 3.90 Gbp anchored to a high-resolution genetic map.9 Projecting a deep whole-genome shotgun assembly, EST, FL-cDNA, and newly developed RNA-seq data onto this framework supports 79,379 transcript clusters, including 26,159 high-confidence genes with homology support from other plant genomes.9 More than 80% of the genome is occupied by repeat sequences.For chromosome-scale, high-quality assembly, each BAC clone from the minimum tiling path was barcoded and sequenced by Illumina short-read sequencing. Then, a high-resolution genetic map created by population sequencing methodology36 and a highly contiguous optical map were combined to construct super-scaffolds composed of merged assemblies from individual BACs. Finally, chromosome conformation capture sequencing (Hi-C) was used to order and orient BAC-based super-scaffolds. The final chromosome-scale assembly represents 4.79 Gbp (~95%) of the genome.37 Mapping of transcriptome data identified 39,734 high-confidence loci and 41,949 low-confidence loci on the basis of sequence homology to related species.4.2. The organellar genomesMiddleton et al.38 determined that the chloroplast sequences from cultivated and wild barley were closely related (sequence identity 99.98%). The divergence time of these haplotypes is estimated to be 80,000 ± 20,000 years using semi-penalized likelihood. A comparison of the chloroplast genome from cultivated barley and common wheat identified four insertions and five deletions >50 bp relative to the common wheat chloroplast genome. The extent of chloroplast sequence similarity indicates that cultivated and wild barleys are more closely related to each other than they are to cultivated wheat.Hisano et al.39 assembled the complete nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial genomes from wild and cultivated barley. Two independent circular maps of the 525,599-bp barley mitochondrial genome were constructed by de novo assembly of high-throughput sequencing reads from the wild accession H602 and from the cultivar Haruna Nijo. These two maps detected only three SNPs between the two haplotypes. Both mitochondrial genomes contained 33 protein-coding genes, three ribosomal RNAs, 16 transfer RNAs, 188 new ORFs, six major repeat sequences, and several types of transposable elements. Mitochondrial genome sequencing is essential for annotating the barley nuclear genome; indeed, these mitochondrial sequences identified a significant number of fragmented mitochondrial sequences in the reported nuclear genome sequences.374.3. TranscriptomesDeep sequencing of the transcriptome (RNA-seq) from the cultivar Morex and FL-cDNAs from the cultivar Haruna Nijo helped to annotate the reference genome of the cultivar Morex.9,37 The recent development of a single-molecule sequencing technique may also support the sequencing of long transcripts. To this end, an international collaborative project on full transcript sequencing for major haplotypes is underway (Waugh et al., unpublished). These long transcript sequences will also contribute to the annotation of pan-genome assemblies (Stein et al., unpublished). As it is essential to isolate intact mature transcripts (mRNA) to obtain FL-cDNA sequences, techniques are being developed to maintain transcript integrity.A de novo RNA-seq-based genotyping procedure for barley strains used in breeding programs has been implemented.40 Using RNA samples from several tissues, reads were mapped onto transcribed regions, which correspond to ~590 Mbp out of the ~4.8 Gbp reference genome. Using 150 samples from 108 strains, this approach detected 181,567 SNPs and 45,135 indels, located in 28,939 transcribed regions distributed throughout the Morex genome.37 The quality of this polymorphism detection method was validated by analysing 387 RNA-seq-derived SNPs by amplicon sequencing. These results demonstrated that this RNA-seq-based de novo polymorphism detection system can generate genome-wide markers, even in the closely related barley genotypes used in breeding programs.4.4. Genomic information and available databasesThe barley research community maintains a diverse array of databases that house information pertaining to barley genetics and genomics that can be easily accessed. Table 1 lists such databases and their respective information type. Barley genome databasesBarley genome databasesFor genome assembly and annotation, EnsemblPlants provides easy access to the most updated barley genome assembly, including chromosome sequences, genes, transcripts, and predicted proteins. The same website also supports Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) searches against the barley genome. Similarly, IPK allows the user to conduct BLAST searches against all sequence resources published by the worldwide barley community, including activities related to the International Barley Sequencing Consortium.Several databases are specifically related to transcripts. PLEXdb is a public resource for gene expression analysis of plants and plant pathogens. This website currently hosts microarray data sets from a range of species, including barley and wheat. HarvEST is principally an EST database viewing platform that emphasizes gene function and is geared towards comparative genomics and oligonucleotide design, in support of activities such as microarray content design, functional annotation, and physical and genetic mapping. The site also allows the display of consolidated maps of approximately 3,000 SNP markers from four barley mapping populations29 and offers a rice synteny viewer. A subset of these mapped SNPs is integrated with the minimum BAC clone tiling path. barleyGenes provides access to predicted genes from an assembly of whole-genome shotgun sequences from barley (cultivar Morex). These genes were predicted from the mapping of RNA-seq data to the genome assembly. Gene expression levels were also calculated from the RNA-seq data and are available in the form of FPKM values associated with the predicted genes. bex-db provides 5'- and 3'-end sequences for 175,000 FL-cDNA clones as well as their expression data in a searchable database. The database also provides a genome browser, showing the locations of cDNA sequences on the barley genome.9Several databases contain barley genomic resource information. GrainGenes, the database of choice for legacy and classical genetics data,41 gathers information such as genetic maps, genes, alleles, genetic markers, phenotypic data, quantitative trait loci studies, experimental protocols, and publications about Triticeae species. Barley DB includes information on barley germplasm and barley genome resources from Okayama University. The database contains 5,006 FL-cDNAs and 134,928 EST entries. The barley germplasm collection from Okayama University and associated information are also available on the site.5. Applied use of the genomic information of barley5.1. Towards the digital bioresource project of barleyThe ultimate goal of barley genomics is to de novo sequence all natural and induced germplasm. The collection of seed samples with unchanged sequences can become a digital bioresource.42,43 However, even the current state of techniques and cost reduction are not sufficient to make sequencing more than a few thousand barley haplotypes possible. After the analysis of sequence data sets, the TRITEX pipeline27 can assemble chromosome-scale sequences for one haplotype in 3–4 weeks for barley. A parallel sequencing and computational analysis may save time, but it is not feasible to sequence thousands of accessions by high-quality chromosome-scale assembly with the current technical standards. For these reasons, partial sequencing of genomes may give useful preliminary information for digital bioresource development in barley. Here, The author summarizes some of the activities and tools used to estimate diversity in natural and induced barley accessions.5.2. Sequence accessions to summarize natural sequence variationThe IPK crop gene bank has a major world collection of barley seed samples. To estimate the diversity in genome sequences in wild and cultivated barleys, a genotyping-by-sequencing platform was applied to single plants from 21,405 accessions in the IPK barley collection.44 All haplotype reads were aligned to the reference genome from the barley cultivar Morex,37 which allowed the detection of 171,263 bi-allelic SNPs. A principal component (PC) analysis of cultivated barleys indicated that PC2 separated Eastern and Western barleys, whereas PC1 set Ethiopian barleys apart. Figure 1 shows that the geographical origin of collection agreed well with the SNP analysis. Representative accessions based on PC analysis are being used to analyse the barley pan-genome (Stein et al., unpublished), which may present a full complement of sequence variation within the barley genome. Principal component analysis of 19,778 domesticated barleys based on 76,102 genotyping-by-sequencing markers from the IPK Bridge Web Portal (https://bridge.ipk-gatersleben.de/bridge/).45 Accessions from Germany (left), Japan (middle), and Ethiopia (right) are plotted on PC1 (y axis) and PC2 (x axis).

The proportion of variance explained by the PCs is indicated on the axes.5.3. Exome sequencingPlant biologists and breeders concentrate most of their efforts on deciphering the functions of genes. Exome sequencing specifically targets coding sequences from the genome, and hence alleviating the need to sequence entire genomes and their repeat content, while bringing the computational needs and cost down to a reasonable range. The barley exome capture system selectively enriches for 61.6 Mbp of coding sequences based on the Morex cultivar HC (high-confidence gene model) sequences, FL-cDNA sequences, and de novo assembled RNA-seq consensus sequence contigs by hybridizing the gene-related fragments (or exons) from genomic libraries.46The platform provides a highly specific and targeted capture of barley exons and closely related species. Using this platform, Russel et al.47 sequenced the exomes of a collection of 267 geo-referenced landraces and wild accessions of barley. A combination of genome-wide analyses demonstrated that the patterns of variation in barley have been strongly shaped by geography and that variant-by-environment associations for individual genes are prominent. A high-density 50 K SNP array with the Illumina Infinium whole-genotyping array was also developed, based on SNP design on exome capture data from 170 lines from a barley diversity panel.485.4. Mapping of mutations for gene annotationThe use of pooled sequencing approaches may accelerate genetic mapping and identification of causal mutations. Mascher et al.49 applied exome sequencing to pooled samples from a barley mapping population segregating for the phenotype caused by the mnd (many noded dwarf) mutant, which increases the rate of leaf initiation. The pool of mutant plants should display a local and specific peak in read depth corresponding to the mutant genomic background around the candidate locus, which can be confirmed by the analysis of independent mutant alleles exhibiting the same phenotype.Another example of mapping by exome sequencing borrowed from an existing pipeline for QTL-seq,50 which was initially developed for genome sequencing in rice. This ‘exome QTL-seq’ approach allowed the mapping of the causal locus underlying the black lemma and pericarp (Blp) phenotype from a segregating population derived from doubled haploid barley lines.51 Exome sequences were assembled into pseudo-contigs by first-ordering exomes based on the genomic coordinates of their respective genes and then limiting each locus to 200 bp in the pseudo-map (but including all relevant SNPs). Short reads generated by the sequencing of the exome capture library are then analysed through this QTL-seq pipeline. The causal loci responsible for the trait of interest are identified based on the relative enrichment in SNP allele frequencies from their original genomic background, as described above for QTL-seq.5.5. Identification of useful genes for the genetic and genomic resources establishedNatural diversity remains a major source of agronomically relevant traits for barley breeding programs. Genetic and genomic resources have been capitalized on to isolate genes of interest that control agronomic and industrial traits. Some such genes were isolated through homology-based cloning, whereas others were isolated via positional cloning strategies. In other cases, several approaches were combined to map genes: positional cloning, synteny with related grasses, and homology-based approaches. Here, we provide two examples of genes underlying important phenotypes that were isolated by our group.The most important step that allowed barley domestication is linked to mutations in the two adjacent, dominant, and complementary genes Brittle rachis (Btr) Btr1 and Btr2. Their loss of function caused barley grains to remain on the inflorescence at maturity, enabling easier and effective harvesting.2 To identify the btr1 and btr2 genes, we crossed the cultivars Kanto Nakate Gold (carrying a btr1-type allele) and Azumamugi (bearing a btr2-type allele) to produce a mapping population segregating at both btr loci. We mapped two candidate genes genetically from >10,000 segregating individuals. We then identified BAC clones using some of the genetic markers used for mapping and sequenced positive clones. We confirmed the identification of both genes via complementation tests by transforming functional Btr alleles in the respective haplotypes.Dormancy allows wild barley grains to survive dry summers in the Near East. After domestication, barley was selected for shorter dormancy periods. Sato et al.52 isolated the major seed dormancy gene QTL for Seed Dormancy 1 (Qsd1) from wild barley, which encodes an alanine aminotransferase (AlaAT). We first built a high-resolution genetic map between the cultivar Haruna Nijo and the wild barley accession H602, narrowing the mapping interval down to two Haruna Nijo BAC clones, which we then annotated, utilizing information from barley EST and FL-cDNA sequences. The candidate gene was knocked down by RNA interference and subjected to complementation tests to determine the phenotypic effects on seed dormancy. The seed dormancy gene is expressed specifically in the embryo. The two Qsd1 alleles responsible for long and short dormancy periods encode proteins that differ by a single amino acid.5.6. Variations in the proteomes useful for trait analysisA unique example of an application of transcript/protein sequence information in barley is related to its industrial product: malt and beer. Iimure et al.53 conducted a two-dimensional gel-based proteome analysis to identify proteins associated with quality traits related to malt and beer production. Several protein species were identified in malt, wort (the first extraction step after malt maceration and mashing), and beer by gel electrophoresis, followed by trypsin digestion and mass spectrometry analyses and/or liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry. In addition, low-molecular-weight polypeptides were isolated from beer by the combination of non-enzymatic digestion and mass analysis. Collectively, these data sets of polypeptides from barley proteomes provide a platform for analysing protein functions in beer. Several novel proteins related to beer quality traits such as foam stability and haze formation have been identified through analysing these proteomes. Some of the proteins have also been turned into efficient protein or DNA markers for trait selection in malting barley breeding.545.7. Transformation, genome editing, and functional validation of identified genesAs described above (see description of the brt1/brt2 and Qsd1 loci), introducing a gene of interest by stable transformation is the standard technique for validating the gene responsible for the target trait. Targeted genome modification technology (so-called genome-editing) offers tremendous promise as a technology that can efficiently produce mutations in desired genes, and several cases of barley genome-editing by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) and the CRISPR-associated nuclease Cas9 have already been reported.55 However, transformation and genome-editing experiments may suffer from some limitations resulting from the low transformation potential of some accessions. Indeed, the old Scottish malting cultivar Golden Promise is one of the few reliable haplotypes for Agrobacterium (Agrobacterium tumefaciens)-mediated transformation. Hisano and Sato56 identified loci controlling transformation amenability in the regions of chromosomes 2H and 3H in an F2 population derived from a cross between the cultivars Golden Promise and Haruna Nijo. Introducing these genomic regions in target haplotypes may increase their transformation efficiency and genome-editing capabilities.5.8. The digital bioresource project for digital breedingNatural and induced variation provides opportunities to analyse traits of interest. However, how to combine sequence and trait information remains a challenging question that needs to be addressed. High-quality genome sequences are essential to establish a digital bioresource centre for world barley ex situ collections but are unfortunately also insufficient. To better understand the contribution of genomic sequence variation to various traits, automatic sequence annotation must become faster and more efficient, since this process currently relies on a slow and manual data curation step. Automated phenotyping is also emerging as an essential goal to diminish the bottleneck associated with the characterization of increasing numbers of accessions. Systematic gene inactivation or modification by genome editing may provide a functional picture of candidate genes of interest in the target haplotype. However, agronomically important traits are often controlled by multiple interacting genes, which demands a deep knowledge of trait-based genetics. Finally, the combined information collected from genomic sequences and the systematic functional analysis of genes may provide novel strategies for trait improvement, for example, the sequence-based digital breeding of barley.6. Conclusion and future perspectivesThe genomes of various organisms have been sequenced and analysed for some 40 years. During this period, development and application of new technologies including computer software frequently changed sequencing strategies. Initially, most plant genome sequencing projects had to rely on a single haplotype to establish a reference genome. However, it has become clear that to sequence multiple haplotypes in parallel would be essential for our understanding of the genetic and genomic features underlying the natural and induced variations. Newly developed technologies of various sorts have allowed us to make it quite efficient to analyse multiple accessions and lines simultaneously, even for species possessing a large genome size such as barley.However, we realize at the same time that we need to establish genetically stable reference accessions to obtain consistent results for genomic and proteomic sequencings. In these regards, a digital bioresource including sequence and related information of all accessions appears to be quite challenging. In the meantime, however, sequencing of a limited number of accessions that cover most of the major sequence variations in a crop species may provide an alternative and efficient strategy to establish the ‘pan-genome’.High-quality sequence assembly will certainly be an indispensable component of the pan-genome infrastructure. The ongoing attempt of a barley pan-genome project aims to construct chromosome-scale sequence assembly for 20 genotypes, consisting of landraces, cultivars, as well as a wild barley accession selected to represent the global barley diversity. The details of the project will be published in the near future which is expected to present an advanced view of barley genomics.The author thanks the National Bioresource Project, Japan, for collection, preservation and distribution of barley resources stored at Okayama University described in this review.Conflict of interestThe author declare that there is no competing interest."

The use of dual index adaptors is the fundamental technique for pooling DNA libraries for Illumina sequencers and is believed not to affect the results. However, here, we observed a decrease of sequence quality in samples containing a specific combination of indexes, namely N704 and S507 in Nextera kits, in multiple runs on the Illumina MiSeq sequencer operated in different facilities.

This approach determines the composition of sequence variants of marker genes using high-throughput DNA sequencers. The use of dual index adaptors is the fundamental technique for pooling DNA libraries for Illumina sequencers and is believed not to affect the results. However, here, we observed a decrease of sequence quality in samples containing a specific combination of indexes, namely N704 and S507 in Nextera kits, in multiple runs on the Illumina MiSeq sequencer operated in different facilities. This decrease was also observed when sequencing randomly fragmented DNA of Escherichia coli and was not observed when either individual adaptor was used. Each end of the DNA library with this index combination contains a complementary sequence motif, which potentially inhibits proper cluster generation and/or subsequent sequencing. Community analysis of the 16S and 18S rRNA amplicons using QIIME2 revealed significant decreases in a-diversity in the samples containing the N704/S507 index combination, resulting from loss of low-abundance sequence variants during denoising. Our data underscore the importance of quality validation of sequence reads in developing dual index techniques and suggest cautious interpretation of microbiome data containing low-quality sequence reads.1. IntroductionAnalysis of the community structure of living organisms is an important aspect of understanding the overall function of an ecosystem. Although isolation and cultivation of organisms is the gold standard for characterization of their physiological, biochemical and genetic properties, most micro-organismal taxa on our planet have yet to be cultured1; moreover, the cultivation process often changes the overall structure of the community.2 In this regard, culture-independent approaches, such as amplicon sequencing and shotgun metagenomics, have become commonplace with the development of high-throughput DNA sequencers. Amplicon sequencing can reveal the composition of organisms in an ecosystem with a high degree of sensitivity, and therefore this technique is replacing classical techniques such as denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and Sanger sequencing of cloned DNA.3 This approach is superior to shotgun metagenomics with respect to sequencing cost per sample and is effective for the analysis of ecosystems in which phenotypes are tightly associated with taxonomy. Amplicon sequencing has been widely applied to the studies of the human microbiome4,5 as well as other microbiomes of diverse environments on earth.6–9Generally, community analysis using amplicon sequencing is performed with the following steps: (i) preparation of DNA libraries by amplification and multiplexing of target genes, (ii) pooling and sequencing of the libraries using high-throughput sequencers, (iii) denoising and/or clustering of the produced sequences, (iv) taxonomy assignment of the sequences using reference databases and (v) analyses of a-diversity (within-sample diversity) and ß-diversity (between-sample diversity). Each step involves several choices. The genes for 16S and 18S rRNAs, which encode the small-subunit rRNAs of prokaryotes and eukaryotes, respectively, are widely used as marker genes. Each rRNA gene contains nine hypervariable regions,10,11 and they are often sequenced together by spanning reads (e.g. regions V3–V4). For sequencing platforms, short read sequencers such as MiSeq (Illumina) and Ion Torrent PGM (Thermo Fisher Scientific) produce highly accurate sequence data with read lengths of 300–500 bp, whereas long-read sequencers such as MinION (Oxford Nanopore) and Sequell (Pacific Biosciences) produce sequence data that are less accurate but have much longer reads, with dozen of kilobase pairs.3,12 Sequencing errors have conventionally been dealt with clustering of sequences into operational taxonomic units (OTUs) based on a distance matrix at a specified threshold (e.g. sequence identity, 97%). Recently, however, sequence errors have been removed based on their quality scores and abundances using the software package dada2,13 deblur14 or UNOISE3.15 Sequences that have been denoised by these packages are referred to by different names: amplicon sequence variants,13 sub-OTUs14 or zero-radius OTUs.15 In this study, these synonymous terms are called ‘sequence variants’ (SVs). For taxonomy assignment of SVs, reference databases for rRNA, such as SILVA for the 16S and 18S rRNA genes,16 RDP for the 16S rRNA and fungal 28S rRNA genes,17 and PR2 for the 18S rRNA gene,18 are well maintained and often used for microbiome studies.The per-sample sequence depth that is required for amplicon sequencing differs between samples but typically ranges from 10 to 100 K reads.19 On the other hand, high-throughput DNA sequencers produce much greater numbers of reads (a maximum of 25 M reads for MiSeq and 5,000 M reads for HiSeq4000). Therefore, researchers use index adaptors to multiplex the different DNA libraries and sequence the pooled libraries in a single run,20 which greatly reduces sequencing cost per sample. The dual index of a DNA library is the fundamental technique for Illumina sequencers, which are the most commonly used platforms for amplicon sequencing.21 The DNA libraries for Illumina sequencers contain P5 and P7 adapters at DNA ends, and these adapters are required for cluster generation for bridge PCR in the flowcell (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Dual index sequences of 8 or 10 bp for multiplexing are inserted next to the P5 and P7 adaptors (Supplementary Fig. S1A). After cluster generation, sequencing primers hybridize at their specific positions within the adaptor, followed by attachment of a dye terminator and capture of fluorescence images; each end and two index regions of the DNA libraries are sequentially sequenced (Supplementary Fig. S1A). The sequence reads produced are demultiplexed based on the combination of dual index sequences. Various dual index systems are commercially available or have been developed by researchers,22,23 which often utilize the same adapter sequences of the Nextera or TruSeq kit from Illumina (Supplementary Fig. S1A).Many studies have been conducted for the validation and comparison of the steps of amplicon sequencing,10,24–27 which include the sequencing platform, target regions, sample preparation techniques and software packages and their parameters. However, the validation of combinations of dual index adaptors is often overlooked and rarely performed by sequencing on the Illumina platform. In this study, we report that a specific combination of dual index adaptors decreases the quality of sequences generated with the MiSeq platform. The decrease in quality was indeed found to affect all reads and positions (in either orientation) of the sequence reads containing a specific index combination, which was probably a consequence of impaired cluster generation and/or subsequent sequencing. We estimated the effect of the quality decrease during a community analysis of the 16S and 18S rRNA amplicons with the use of the dada2 plugin in QIIME2,28 which is one of the most common open software packages for sequence analysis. The diminished sequence quality was found to result in a significant decrease in a-diversity and could not be recovered by tuning the denoising parameters. Our data underscore the importance of quality validation of sequence reads when developing dual index technologies for Illumina platforms and suggest cautious interpretation of microbiome data containing low-quality sequence reads.2. Materials and methods2.1. Library preparation of Escherichia coli DNAGenomic DNA of Escherichia coli strain HST08 (Takara Bio Inc.), which was originally derived from E. coli strain K-12, was used for the preparation of a sequence library containing diverse insert sequences. Escherichia coli cells were grown in Luria–Bertani medium and harvested by centrifugation. Cells were lysed in a buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 1 mM EDTA) containing 1% (w/v) SDS, extracted with Tris-buffered phenol and centrifuged at 8,000 × g at 20°C for 5 min for phase separation. DNA was isolated from the upper/aqueous phase using the DNeasy blood and tissue kit. The concentration of the purified DNA was 19.0 ng/µl, as quantified with the Qubit dsDNA BR Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Tagmentation of E. coli genomic DNA was performed using the Nextera XT DNA sample prep kit (Illumina) with the following modifications: the amount of input DNA was reduced from 1 to 0.1 ng, the tagmentation reaction time was increased from 5 to 15 min and 2× tagmentation buffer from the kit was replaced with 5× tagmentation buffer of the Nextera Mate Pair Library Preparation kit (Illumina). Tagmentation was stopped with addition of NTB and NPM buffers (Nextera XT DNA sample prep kit), and the libraries were indexed with 19 combinations of the index adaptor containing either N704 or S507 using the Nextera XT index kit set A v2 (Illumina) with 15 cycles of index PCR using KOD FX Neo DNA polymerase (Toyobo). Thermal cycling for index PCR was as follows: initial denaturation at 94°C for 2 min, then 30 cycles of denaturation at 98°C for 10 s, annealing at 55°C for 30 s and extension at 68°C for 30 s, with a final extension step at 68°C for 5 min. DNA in each amplified library was purified with 0.55 volumes of AMPure XP beads. The size distribution of each library was checked with the High Sensitivity DNA kit (Agilent) on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent).2.2. Library preparation of the 16S and 18S rRNA ampliconsAs the sequencing target for the 16S and 18S amplicons, we chose an algal mat (sample S1) that we previously collected from a freshwater lake in Antarctica.29 The DNA of S1 was purified previously29 (10.7 ng/µl, as quantified with the Qubit dsDNA BR Assay kit). The V3–V4 region of 16S rRNA and V7–V8 region of 18S rRNA were amplified with the primer pair 341F and 805R30 and F1183 and R1631,11 respectively (we previously reported the full sequences of these primers29). Enzyme and PCR conditions were the same as those for index PCR of E. coli DNA except that there were 30 PCR cycles. The first amplicon PCR products were purified with 0.8 volume of AMPure XP beads and eluted with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). The second index PCR was performed with eight cycles using the Nextera XT index kit v2 set A (Illumina) with the aforementioned PCR conditions. Amplified libraries were purified by addition of 1.12 volumes of AMPure XP beads and eluted with 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5). The DNA in each library was quantified using the Qubit dsDNA HS Assay kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). The size distribution of libraries was investigated using the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA kit on the Bioanalyzer 2100. The two libraries of 16S rRNA amplicons indexed with N504/S507 and N503/S507 combinations were subjected to direct sequencing on 3730xl DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems) by Macrogen Japan using primer P5 (5'-ATACGGCGACCACCGAGATC) or P7 (5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAG) (Supplementary Fig. S1C). The sequence libraries for the E. coli genome and the 16S rRNA and 18S rRNA amplicons were pooled and sequenced for 300 bp of both ends using the MiSeq reagent kit v3 (600 cycles; Illumina) with the MiSeq instrument (Illumina). Data were processed using Real-Time Analysis ver. 1.18.54 and MiSeq Control Software ver. 2.6.21. Cluster density was 742 K/mm2, the cluster passing filter was 90.3% and the aligned PhiX spike-in was 12.3%. The produced sequence reads were demultiplexed based on the combination of dual index adapters with the MiSeq Control Software.2.3. Data analysisTo obtain the sequence reads derived from E. coli DNA, demultiplexed sequences were mapped to the reference genome sequence of E. coli K-12 substrain W3110 in the RefSeq database (GCF_000010245.2_ASM1024v1_genomic.fna) using bowtie2 with default parameters.31–33 Uniquely mapped reads were obtained using samtools view command with the -q 4 option in samtools ver. 1.10,34 which also removed the 16S and 18S rRNA amplicons that could be mapped multiple times to four copies of the rRNA operons in E. coli. Ranges of 125,389–270,435 read 1 sequences and 118,612–266,374 read 2 sequences were obtained as sequence reads uniquely mapped to the E. coli genome (Supplementary Table S2). Reference sequences were corrected with pilon ver. 1.23 with—fix bases option.35 Paired reads were extracted from uniquely mapped reads using fastq_pair,36 and read length was trimmed to 300 bp using seqtk ver. 1.3 (https://github.com/lh3/seqtk). The processed paired reads were mapped to the corrected E. coli genome using bowtie2, and sequence error rate was calculated using the samtools stats command. Per-read and per-base Phred quality scores were calculated using FastQC v0.11.9.37 The distribution of the mean expected errors per sample was calculated using the command vsearch –fastq_eestats2.38 The results files exported from these programmes were processed using custom scripts in Perl ver. 5.24.4 or R ver.3.6.1.To obtain the sequence reads for the 16S or 18S rRNA amplicon, the 5' sequence of each read was searched in the demultiplexed sequences. We used cutadapt v2.939 with the options -g ^CCTACGGGNGGCWGCAG and -G ^GACTACHVGGGTATCTAATCC for the 16S rRNA amplicon and options -g ^AATTTGACTCAACACGGG and -G ^TACAAAGGGCAGGGACG for the 18S rRNA amplicon. Additionally, we utilized discard-untrimmed and no-indels options for both amplicons. These options extract sequence reads that harbor 5'-anchored amplicon primers in both reads, remove the primer sequence and export the sequence reads of uniform length: 284 bp of read 1 and 280 bp of read 2 for the 16S rRNA amplicon, and 283 bp of read 1 and 284 bp of read 2 for the 18S rRNA amplicon. The total number of read pairs ranged from 35,311 to 82,408 for the 16S rRNA amplicon and from 44,785 to 101,078 for the 18S rRNA amplicon (Supplementary Table S2). The sequence reads of the 16S and 18S rRNA amplicons were imported to the environment of QIIME2 ver. 2020.2.40 Forward and reverse reads were joined, denoised and checked for chimeras using the dada2 plugin with quality filtering thresholds of [6, 8] for the [–p-max-ee-f, –p-max-ee-r] parameters and overlap length thresholds of [260, 210] for the [–p-trunc-len-f, –p-trunc-len-r] parameters for both the 16S and the 18S rRNA analyses. For the optimization of these parameters, we compared the values of [2, 4], [4, 8], [6, 8] and [8, 10] for the [–p-max-ee-f, –p-max-ee-r] parameters and values of [250, 200], [260, 210] and [270, 220] for the [–p-trunc-len-f, –p-trunc-len-r] parameters. This optimization was performed with dada2 ver. 1.14 on R to investigate the number of denoised forward and reverse reads because the dada2-plugin (ver. 1.10) in QIIME2 reports the number of denoised reads only for forward reads in dada2-stats file.For denoising using deblur plugin, the adapter-removed reads were trimmed at their 3' end to yield read 1 with 260 bp and read 2 with 210 bp using seqtk. Paired reads were joined using the vsearch join-pairs command and denoised using the deblur denoise-16S or denoise-other (for 18S) command with –p-trim-length 400 –p-min-reads 2 options. Reference sequences of 18S rRNA clustered at 90% identity in SIVA ver.132 (silva_132_90_18S.fna) were used for the positive filtering of the 18S rRNA analysis. Rate of the number of unique reads in total merged reads was analysed using the command vsearch-derep_fulllength. For OTU clustering, joined reads were processed with the vsearch dereplicate-sequences and cluster-features-de-novo commands at thresholds of 0.97 for 16S rRNA and 0.99 for 18S rRNA, which are followed by de novo chimera removal with the vsearch uchime-denovo command. Low-abundance OTUs were then removed with the feature-table filter-features command in QIIME2 with –p-min-frequency 2 or 10 option.Taxonomy of the SVs was assigned using a feature-classifier plugin that was trained with taxonomy information of majority_taxonomy_7_levels.txt with 99% clustering in the SILVA database ver. 132 (https://www.arb-silva.de/download/archive/)16 for the 16S rRNA analysis or pr2_version_4.12.0_18S_mothur.tax of the Protist Ribosomal Reference database (PR2) (https://github.com/pr2database/pr2database/releases)18 for the 18S rRNA analysis. Rarefaction curves were plotted using the rarecurve function in the vegan package ver. 2.5.6. For a-diversity analyses, non-chimeric SVs were rarefied to an even depth of 16,958 and 28,018 sequences for the 16S and 18S rRNA genes, respectively, using the rarefy_even_depth function of the phyloseq package ver. 1.28.0 in R.41 Shannon and Simpson diversity indices42 were calculated with the estimate_richness function of the phyloseq package. The Grubbs test43 was performed using the outliers package ver. 0.14 in R.44 Plots were visualized using the phyloseq or ggplot2 ver. 3.2.1 packages in R.41,45 All sequence data for E. coli and the 16S and 18S rRNA amplicons were deposited in DDBJ with accession number DRA010058.3. Results and discussion3.1. A specific combination of indexes decreases the quality of the outputted sequence dataFor the samples we subjected to amplicon sequencing on MiSeq, we frequently observed that one of the samples had consistently lower sequence quality compared with the other samples. Figure 1 shows the typical data for per-sample sequence quality for nine runs with the 600 cycle kit, producing 300 bp × 2 paired reads (Fig. 1A), and six runs with the 500-cycle kit, producing 250 bp × 2 paired reads (Fig. 1B).46 In Illumina paired-end sequencing, read 1 has higher quality than read 2. Notably, decreases of sequence quality were observed in both read 1 and read 2 of the aforementioned low-quality sample in each run (Fig. 1A and B, enclosed circles). Runs with the 500-cycle kit produced higher sequence quality than runs with the 600-cycle kit, as sequence quality gradually decreased towards the end of the sequence read. The odd decrease in sequence quality was observed in runs with both types of kits (Fig. 1A and B). The quality decrease was observed in the two different MiSeq instruments operated in the two different facilities: Toyohashi University of Technology and Osaka Prefecture University (Fig. 1A). Samples in these runs were derived from different environments such as seawater, rat feces, human skin and microbial mats, and thus different samples contained different regions such as region V4 and the V3–V4 and V1-V2 regions of 16S rRNA, the V7–V8 region of 18S rRNA, the gene nifH and combinations of these loci (Supplementary Table S1). These points suggest that the observed decrease in sequence quality was not caused by the type of sequence kit, instrument-specific issue or sample origin. We performed extensive trouble shooting of this phenomenon and ultimately surmised that samples with low-sequence quality commonly contained a specific combination of dual index adaptors, namely N704 and S507 indexes, in the Nextera index kits (Illumina) (Fig. 1A and B). As Illumina is not responsible for providing support for amplicon sequencing, we carried out a detailed investigation of the effects of the N704/S507 index combination. Effects of the combination of dual index adaptors on sequence quality with MiSeq. Distribution of the arithmetic mean of expected error per sample is shown for read 1 and read 2 of paired-end sequences. Runs were performed with the different MiSeq sequencers operated at Toyohashi University of Technology (Toyohashi) or Osaka Prefecture University (Osaka) with the MiSeq reagent kit for 600 cycles (A) or 500 cycles (B). Samples in different runs are colored accordingly.

Samples in different runs are colored accordingly. Samples with the N704 and S507 index combination are enclosed with a red dashed line.To investigate the effect of the N704/S507 index combination on sequence quality, we sequenced genomic DNA of E. coli that had been randomly fragmented using Nextera transposase and indexed with a total of 19 index combinations containing either N704 or S507 (Supplementary Fig. S2 and see Section 2 for experimental design). The distribution of per-read Phred quality (Q) scores revealed that decreased sequence quality was observed in both read 1 and read 2 with the N704/S507 combination but not with the other index combinations (Fig. 2A and B). The N704/S507 combination showed single peaks at Q33 for read 1 and at Q25 for read 2, whereas most of the other combinations showed single peaks at Q35 for read 1 and at Q33–34 for read 2 (Fig. 2A and B). Per-base Phred quality scores revealed that the decrease of the sequence quality for N704/S507 occurred at all positions of read 1 and read 2 (Fig. 2C and D). These results indicate that (i) the decrease of sequence quality was not caused by the sequence inserted in the amplicons but rather by the specific combination of N704/S507 dual index adaptors, (ii) the decrease of sequence quality was global in the produced reads and (iii) the decrease did not occur when either the N704 or the S507 adaptor was used in combination with any other index adaptor. We investigated the rate of mismatches of the sequence reads mapped to the E. coli genome and confirmed that the sequence error rate indeed increased by ~2-fold in the N704/S507 combination (Supplementary Fig. S3). These results revealed that the specific combination of N704 and S507 adaptors caused a decrease of sequence quality and an increase of actual sequence errors for MiSeq-outputted sequences. Notably, the N704/S505 combination led to slightly lower per-read and per-base Phred quality scores compared with the other samples (Fig. 2A–D and Supplementary Fig. S3A), reinforcing the idea that this combination was responsible for the observed decrease in sequence quality.

Effects of index combination on sequencing and denoising of the 16S and 18S rRNA ampliconsWe next investigated the effect of the index combination on amplicon sequencing of the V3–V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene and the V7–V8 region of the 18S rRNA gene. Our protocol for the 16S rRNA V3–V4 region corresponded to the protocol provided by Illumina.47 We utilized an environmental sample from an algal mat collected from a freshwater lake in Antarctica, whose community structure was revealed in our recent study using the primer sets mentioned above.29 To investigate the effects of index combination, aliquots of first-amplicon PCR products derived from the algal mat DNA were subjected to a second index PCR with 12 index combinations of the N7xx series and S507 (Supplementary Fig. S2). As observed for the sequencing of E. coli genomic DNA, the decrease of per-read Phred quality score was observed in both read 1 and read 2 for both the 16S and 18S rRNA amplicons (Fig. 3A). Fragment analysis showed that the library size increased by 50–75 bp after index PCR for all samples, and no primer dimers were detected (Fig. 3B). We performed Sanger sequencing of the 16S rRNA amplicon libraries indexed with N504/S507 or N503/S507 (control) combinations using custom primers that anneal to the P5 or P7 region and confirmed chromatogram for the adaptor sequences (Supplementary Fig. S1C). These data indicated that the decrease of sequence quality in the library with the N704/S507 combination was not caused by contamination of primer dimers or by heterogeneity of the DNA library owing to inefficient index PCR but rather by sequencing processes inherent in MiSeq. The relationship between the number of reads and the concentration of the input library showed that sequence production yields decreased in libraries with the N704/S507 combination for both the 16S and the 18S rRNA amplicons (Fig. 3C). This implies that the decrease of sequence quality is caused by a partial deficiency in cluster generation and/or subsequent sequencing processes in the flowcell.

Input, filtered, denoised forward (F), denoised reverse (R), merged and non-chimeric reads are colored accordingly.We attempted to mitigate the decrease in both the number and the quality of sequence reads with the N704/S507 combination by tuning parameters in the denoising process of the dada2 plugin in QIIME2.28 In the current version of QIIME2, denoising using the dada2 plugin is performed with the following steps13: (i) the sequence reads of read 1 and read 2 are filtered based on the quality (maximum number of expected errors) and trimmed at the 3' end of each read at a specified length; (ii) sequence errors in read 1 and read 2 are removed separately based on the quality, hamming distance and abundance of the reads, and singleton reads are also removed during this process; (iii) read 1 and read 2 pairs are merged, having at least a 12-bp overlap, and read pairs containing any mismatches are discarded and (iv) de novo chimera detection is performed, and chimeric read pairs are discarded. We investigated the number of reads remaining after each process using four different values for the maximum expected error, namely, [2, 4], [4, 6], [6, 8] and [8, 10] for [–p-max-ee-f, –p-max-ee-r]. These values were determined based on the distribution of expected errors in read 1 and read 2 (Supplementary Fig. S4). In the samples with the N704/S507 combination, increasing the values of [–p-max-ee-f, –p-max-ee-r] improved the relative abundance of filtered reads, but substantial numbers of reads were removed during denoising and merging processes, and non-chimeric reads essentially plateaued at ~50% of input reads (Fig. 3D). On the other hand, samples with other index combinations remained at ~70–80% of input reads as non-chimeric reads for any values of [–p-max-ee-f, –p-max-ee-r] parameters (Supplementary Fig. S5). These data suggested that denoising did not fully remove sequence errors and that the resultant singleton reads and/or mismatches in the paired reads were responsible for the decrease in the number of non-chimeric reads. The length of overlap of the paired reads for 460-bp amplicons was estimated at ~50 bp when the values of [260, 210] were used for [–p-trunc-len-f, –p-trunc-len-r]. A change of these parameters to [250, 200] (~30-bp overlap) or [270, 220] (~70-bp overlap) did not substantially change the abundance of the non-chimeric reads with all examined index combinations (Fig. 3D and Supplementary Fig. S6). This suggested that the reduction of reads was caused mainly by the denoising process rather than by mismatches resulting from the merging process. Notably, the reduction of reads occurred in the denoising of the reverse reads rather than the forward reads, underscoring the inherent difficulty of denoising low-quality sequences. Data sets with the parameter [6, 8] for [–p-trunc-len-f, and –p-trunc-len-r] and [260, 210] for [–p-trunc-len-f, –p-trunc-len-r] were used for further analysis of community structures of the 16S and 18S rRNA amplicons. We also investigated the rate of the number of unique reads in the total merged reads without denoising to estimate the actual sequence error rate. The rate of the unique reads in the N704/S507 combination was 93% in both 16S and 18S rRNA amplicons, which was substantially higher than 58% for 16S rRNA and 50% for 18S rRNA in the average of rest combinations and reflects the increase of the actual sequence error rate (Supplementary Fig. S3B).3.3. Effect of index combination on community structure of the 16S and 18S rRNA ampliconsRarefaction curves for the number of identified SVs of 16S rRNA amplicon using dada2 plugin revealed that samples with the N704/S507 combination reached a plateau at a substantially lower number of SVs compared with the other index combinations (Fig. 4A). The decrease of a-diversity for the N704/S507 combination was significant in the Grubbs test for the identified SVs (P = 3.121e - 9), Shannon index (P = 1.521e - 12) and Simpson index (P = 1.675e - 12) for reads rarefied to 16,958 non-chimeric reads (Fig. 4B). The phylum-level composition of the 16S rRNA amplicons based on the SILVA ver. 132 database showed an increase of Bacteroidetes and Verrucomicrobia and a decrease in Planctomycetes and Proteobacteria compared with the samples having other index combinations (Fig. 4C, left). The major taxa (>1%) at the order and genus levels of classification were detected in all 12 samples, but their relative abundances were increased when the N704/S507 combination was used, as compared with the other index combinations (Fig. 4C, centre and right). Heatmap analysis of the presence or absence of SVs, which were sorted in decreasing order of mean abundance across all samples, revealed that most of the low-abundance SVs and even some of the abundant SVs could not be detected in samples with the N704/S507 combination (Fig. 4D). The plot of relative abundance of each SV and its rank demonstrated the increase of high-rank SVs and decrease of low-rank SVs in samples with the N704/S507 combination (Fig. 4E). Thus, the use of the N704/S507 combination substantially decreases the sensitivity of detection of the minor SVs and alters the overall composition and a-diversity of the samples in amplicon sequencing.

Plots of the 12 samples with different index combinations are colored accordingly for (A), (B) and (E).We also investigated the effect of index combination in the analysis of 18S rRNA amplicons, which are less diverse than the 16S rRNA amplicons. Rarefaction analysis with dada2 plugin revealed that samples with the N704/S507 combination reached a plateau at a lower number of SVs compared with the other index combinations, as was the case for the16S rRNA amplicons (Fig. 5A). The decrease of a-diversity for the N704/S507 combination was significant in the Grubbs test for the identified SVs (P = 1.477e - 7), Shannon index (P = 7.578e - 10) and Simpson index (P = 3.847e - 7) at a read depth rarefied to 28,018 (Fig. 5B). Division-level composition of the 18S rRNA amplicons based on the PR2 database revealed an increase of Metazoa and a decrease of Cercozoa compared with the samples of the other index combinations (Fig. 5C, left). The major taxa (>0.5%) at the family and genus levels of classification were detected in all 12 samples, but their relative abundances were increased in the N704/S507 combination compared with the other index combinations (Fig. 5C, centre and right). Heatmap analysis revealed that low-abundance SVs could not be detected in samples with the N704/S507 combination and that this failure of detection was responsible for the observed increase in the relative abundance of high-rank SVs in those samples (Fig. 5D and E). Thus, the use of the N704/S507 combination substantially decreases the sensitivity of minor SVs in amplicon sequencing for both the 16S and the 18S rRNA genes.

Plots of the 12 samples with different index combinations are colored accordingly for (A), (B) and (E).We assessed the effect of the index combination using another denoising plugin, deblur,14 in QIIME2. Rarefaction curve analysis of SVs obtained using deblur showed a similar result using dada2 but with a more substantial decrease in the total number of non-chimeric reads of the N704/S507 combination in the 16S and 18S rRNA amplicons (Fig. 6A and B). The differences may be due to the different denoising approaches between deblur and dada2: deblur denoises sequence errors and removes singletons per sample with a positive filtering against reference database, whereas dada2 performs denoising and singleton removal across samples without the positive filtering.13,14 We also performed conventional OTU clustering with typical thresholds of 97% and 99% identities for 16S and 18S rRNA amplicons, respectively. Rarefaction curves for OTUs observed at least two times across samples showed an increase in the number of the identified OTUs in the N704/S507 combination, where the 16S rRNA analysis showed moderate increase compared with the 18S rRNA analysis (Fig. 6C and D). When the threshold of the abundance filtering was raised to 10, all index combinations showed closer rarefaction curves (Fig. 6E and F). This suggests that the conventional OTU clustering with abundance filtering was more tolerant of the sequence errors and could give a more robust estimation of a-diversity compared with the denoising approach. However, the use of OTU clustering expenses the high-sequence resolution of SVs and also inflates the total number of OTUs,13,48 and hence users should carefully choose the methods for dealing with sequence errors. Rarefaction curve analyses for SVs denoised using deblur and clustered OTUs. Rarefaction curve analyses were performed for SVs denoised using deblur plugin in the 16S (A) and 18S (B) rRNA amplicons. The same analyses were performed for OTUs clustered at 97 and 99% for the 16S (C and E) and 18S (D and F) rRNA amplicons with abundance-based filtering of 2 (C and D) or 10 (E and F). Lines of the 12 samples with different index combinations are colored accordingly. Rarefaction curve analyses for SVs denoised using deblur and clustered OTUs.

Lines of the 12 samples with different index combinations are colored accordingly. 3.4. Possible mechanisms for the decrease of sequence qualityOur results demonstrate that the use of the N704/S507 combination of dual index adaptors causes the observed decrease of sequence quality and sequence yield. What mechanism underlies this effect? The index sequence has a length of only 8 bp but must be responsible for the decrease of sequence quality, as this effect was found to be independent of the sequences of the insert DNA (Fig. 2). One explanation could be that, after cluster generation, the sequencing primer hybridizes not only at the proper position for sequencing but also partially to a position near the index sequences, and the consequent mixing of the emitted fluorescence in the cluster decreases the sequence quality (Figs 2A–D and 3A). Our data suggest that this is unlikely, however, because the use of either the N704 or the S507 index adapter did not affect the sequence quality. If this mechanism was responsible for the decrease of sequence quality, the decrease should have occurred in all samples containing either the N704 or the S507 index. Overall, the results indicate that the ‘interaction’ of the two index sequences, that is, N704 and S507, is responsible for the quality decrease. Notably, each end of the DNA library with the N704/S507 combination contains the sequence motif ‘AGGAGTxTCGTxGGC’ that spans the index and Nextera adaptor regions (Supplementary Fig. S1B). This fact suggests that, during primer hybridization with Illumina sequencing, the two complementary sequence motifs in the single-stranded DNA form an intra-molecular loop structure at equilibrium (Supplementary Fig. S1B). We speculate that the formation of the loop structure inhibits the hybridization of the sequencing primers for read 1 and read 2 and caused the decrease of sequencing quality. Alternatively, the complementary sequence motif may affect the efficiency of cluster generation via bridge PCR amplification of single DNA molecules. Because the sequencing mechanisms of the Illumina platform are not fully available to the public, we trust that these possibilities will be further investigated by the Illumina development team. It should be mentioned that the ‘AGGAGTC’ motif existed in the library with the N704 and S505 combination that showed slightly decreased sequence quality (Supplementary Fig. S1B), implying that the complementary sequences can lower the sequence quality in other combinations.3.5. Caution for other applicationsThe substantial decrease of sequence quality was found to occur with the N704/S507 index combination in the Nextera XT Index kit v2 Set A, which has a maximum of 96 multiplex (combinations with the 12 indexes of the N7xx series and 8 indexes of the S5xx series). The simple solution for preventing this decrease in quality is to avoid using the N704/S507 combination and rather use the other 95 combinations, as we did not observe any substantive decrease of quality with any combination other than N704/S507 using this kit (Figs 1 and 2A–D). The Nextera DNA unique dual Index kit (maximum 384 multiplex, Illumina) utilizes a 10-bp index and does not contain any sequences corresponding to N704 or S507. However, ‘TCGTxGGC’ of the Nextera overhang sequences is responsible for the formation of 8/15 bp of the AGGAGTxTCGTxGGC motif (Supplementary Fig. S1B). This fact suggests that the use of Nextera-based dual index adaptors could lead to the formation of complementary sequences other than this motif, leading to a decrease of sequence quality. On the other hand, TruSeq-based index kits are available, for example the QIAseq 16S/ITS Index kits (maximum 1,536 multiplex, Qiagen), NEBNext Multiplex Oligos (maximum 384 multiplex, New England Biolabs) and the KAPA Dual-Indexed Adapter kit (maximum 96 multiplex, Roche). A triple-indexing design based on TruSeq adaptors has also been proposed.22 These TruSeq-based index adaptors do not contain complementary sequences like those found in Nextera adaptors (Supplementary Fig. S1B).Our data demonstrate the importance of validating the index combination for developing dual index systems. For example, iNext and iTru dual index systems were recently developed and have their basis in Nextera- and TruSeq-based dual index adaptors, respectively, and these sophisticated systems can establish a total of 147,456 combinations (i.e. i7 × i5: 384 × 384).23 Unfortunately, these systems have been validated for 208 combinations using either adaptor (i7 × i5: 160 × 1 and 1 × 48) by quantitative PCR, and only 12 combinations have been validated by sequencing E. coli DNA on MiSeq.23 Validation of either adaptor alone was found to be insufficient because the decrease of quality can be caused by a specific combination of index sequences, for example, the N704/S507 combination. Quantitative PCR has been applied to the validation of dual index kits during their development, but this method could potentially fail to detect the decrease in sequence quality. Therefore, dual index adaptors should be validated by sequencing with the Illumina platform using a control library, for example, E. coli DNA or mock amplicons. It is unrealistic for users to perform a sequencing run for quality check for all these index combinations, and hence we strongly encourage manufacturers and developers of dual index kits to disclose the quality of data for all index combinations by Illumina sequencing. Alternatively, users can analyse the per-read Phred quality score for samples with different index combinations using FastQC37 and compare their distributions in a single graph using MultiQC.49 Unlike sequencing of DNA or RNA libraries, amplicon sequencing utilizes a uniform insert length, and thus the quality of all outputted sequences should be similar within the same run (Fig. 1).4. ConclusionAlthough the Nextera XT index kit v2 is widely used in microbiome studies,47,50–52 it remains unclear that how many studies have utilized the N704/S507 combination because the combination of index is rarely described in the published article or deposited sequence in the database. Therefore, it is important to validate the significance of the quality decrease in the N704/S507 combination by other researchers in other facilities over the world. Our results showed that the plugin dada2 can remove sequence errors for low-quality reads,13 but dada2 cannot fully recover the loss of low-abundance SVs resulting from low-quality reads (Figs 4E and 5E). The plugin deblur was also ineffective to denoise the low-quality samples with the N704/S507 combination (Fig. 6A and B). The effects of such low-quality data can be mitigated by focusing on only major SVs (e.g. SVs with mean abundance >0.5%), but this narrowed focus substantially reduces the sensitivity of amplicon sequencing (Figs 4E and 5E). Conventional OTU clustering with abundance filtering can deal with the decreased sequenced quality (Fig. 6E and F), but it expenses the high-sequence resolution of SVs and inflates the number of OTUs.13,48 Therefore, if low-quality data are obtained for any particular sample owing to an issue with the combination of dual index adaptors, it is better to remake the sequence library and repeat the analysis with a different index combination. Finally, we suggest that researchers should be careful in denoising the samples with any index combinations containing low-quality sequence reads and interpretation of the results in microbiome studies.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.Accession numberDRA010058.The authors thank Dr. Hiroshi Mori (National Institute of Genetics) and Dr. Sachiko Yoshida (Toyohashi University of Technology) for helpful discussions.FundingThis research was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research (S) (grant number 15H05712) to N.H. from the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS).

IntroductionBats belong to the order Chiroptera and have the ability of powered flight. Accounting for one-fifth of all mammals in terms of the number of species, bats are one of the most successful groups of mammals.1 It is of primary interest for biologists to identify the processes and mechanisms of dynamic adaptation in bats. Traditionally, morphological and paleontological analyses placed the order Chiroptera within the superorder Archonta (Primates, Dermoptera, Chiroptera, and Scandentia).2 However, DNA sequencing data has challenged the validity of the Archonta, and alternatively proposed the inclusion of bats into Laurasiatheria (Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Carnivora, Pholidota, Chiroptera and Eulipotyphla).3–6 Although Laurasiatheria is now considered to be a natural assemblage, the phylogenetic position of bats within Laurasiatheria remains to be resolved.7,8The paraphyly of microbats is also under debate. Traditionally, morphological studies proposed the sub-division of the order Chiroptera into two suborders: Microchiroptera (microbats) and Megachiroptera (megabats or Old-World fruit bats).9 Microbats use ultrasonic echolocation for flight and for foraging in the night, whereas megabats do not echolocate, and primarily use vision to fly and feed on fruits and/or nectars. Megabats are also neuro-anatomically distinct from microbats, as megabats have a developed visual system.10 Molecular data suggests that five lineages of microbats, including Rhinopomatidae, Rhinolophidae, Hipposideridae, Craseonycteridae, and Megadermatidae, are more closely related to megabats than to other microbats. Therefore, the five lineages of rhinolophoid microbats and megabats were re-classified as ‘Yinpterochiroptera’ and the remaining microbats as ‘Yangochiroptera’.5,11,12 Thus, recent molecular studies suggest that several adaptive characteristics specific to megabats have emerged within a short period of time from a microbat-like ancestor.Genome-wide analyses have been used to identify the unique evolution of bats in several studies. Seim et al.’s13 study determined the genome sequence of one microbat (Brandt’s bat) and found the signatures for adaptive evolution in genes related to physiology and longevity. Zhang et al.14 determined the genome sequences of one microbat (David’s myotis) and one megabat (black flying fox) and found that genes for flight and immunity evolved due to positive selection. Parker et al.15 identified the genomes of three microbats, including the greater horseshoe bat, the greater false vampire bat, and Parnell’s mustached bat, and one megabat, the straw-coloured fruit bat. In comparing the genomes of these bats with those of other mammals, this study identified that genes related to hearing/deafness showed convergent evolution among echolocating mammals. Pavlovich et al.16 recently determined the whole genome of the Egyptian fruit bat (R. aegyptiacus), which is a natural reservoir for the Marburg virus, and revealed that the genes for immunity were expanded and diversified, suggesting an antiviral mechanism that is used to control viral infection. Especially, as bats are natural hosts for zoonotic virus including henipaviruses, filoviruses, and coronaviruses, which are emerging viruses with high rates of fatality, the comparative genomic study in bats may provide an effective solution against the current global pandemics of coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19).17In this study, we determined the genome sequences of two rousette megabats, Leschenault’s rousette (Rousettus leschenaultia) and the Egyptian fruit bat (R. aegyptiacus). We assessed the genomic signatures for the process of natural selection that facilitates the dynamic and adaptive evolution of megabats. In particular, the main aim to determine the whole-genome sequence of Egyptian fruit bat in addition to the previous study16 is to obtain higher quality genome data, which facilitates more accurate and comprehensive gene annotations, especially for multi-gene families. In addition, the genome sequences of Leschenault’s rousette belonging to the same genus as the Egyptian fruit bat is of our interest to identify genomic differences in closely related bat species. These genome sequences were compared with those of 22 mammals, including six microbats and three megabats, available in the database. We used genome-wide phylogenetic analyses, followed by candidate gene analyses focussed on retroposons and chemosensory multi-gene families for taste, olfaction, and pheromone detection. In addition, we also performed global positive selection analyses. As a result, the inter-relationships among Laurasiatheria were consistently reconstructed, with the order Eulipotyphla diverging first, followed by the divergence of Chiroptera and the remaining groups, including Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla, Pholidota, and Carnivora. The reciprocal monophyly of Yinpterochiroptera and Yangochiroptera was also shown with reliable statistical support. We revealed several notable distinct features in megabat genomes, including extremely low activity of SINE retrotranspositions and the expansion of the genes for the trace amine receptor (TAAR) and olfactory receptor (OR). Additionally, the signatures for positive or relaxed selection were observed in genes for immunity and protein catabolism. Thus, our comparative genomic analyses may illuminate the genetic mechanisms underlying the dynamic adaptation of megabats during diversification in the order Chiroptera.2. Materials and methods2.1. Specimens and tissue samplesEgyptian fruit bats (R. aegyptiacus) and Leschenault’s rousettes (R. leschenaulti), both of which were provided by Ueno Zoo, were maintained under controlled conditions using an air conditioner and moisture chamber. The animals were kept in steel cages and fed fruit and water at the same time every day. All experiments were performed in accordance with the Animal Experimentation Guidelines of the University of Tokyo and were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of the University of Tokyo. As for Egyptian fruit bats, we prepared kidney-derived primary cultured cells. A pregnant Egyptian fruit bat was deeply anesthetized with isoflurane, the uteri were surgically removed, and the animal was euthanized by bleeding. The kidney from the fetus was fragmented using scissors and treatment with TrypLE (Gibco). The fragmented kidney was then cultured in DMED containing 5% fetal calf serum to obtain primary cultured cells.2.2. Genome sequencing and assemblyGenomic DNA was extracted from the frozen spleen tissue or cultured kidney cells of two individuals of Egyptian fruit bat, and frozen kidney tissue from one individual of Leschenault’s rousette, using a Blood & Cell Culture DNA Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany), according to the manufacturer’s protocol with minor laboratory customizations, the information can be available upon request. The DNA samples (>20 kb) were subjected to the sequencing as described below after quality and quantity check. To construct paired-end sequencing libraries, the genomic DNA was fragmented using a Covaris S2 Focussed-ultrasonicator (Covaris, Woburn, MA, USA). The paired-end libraries were constructed using the TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Library Prep kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Mate pair libraries were prepared from genomic DNA using the Nextera Mate Pair Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). All libraries were sequenced on an Illumina-HiSeq 2500 system using rapid-mode chemistry with paired-end sequencing. Prior to assembly, data pre-processing was performed. First, the adapter sequences were trimmed using the fastq-clipper ea-utils v1.1.2,18 setting the parameters to ‘-p 10 -m 1 -l 0’. Second, we filtered the reads mapped to the mitochondrial genome using BWA-ALN v0.6.219 with default parameters. Finally, we performed base error correction using SOAPec v2.0120 with the parameters ‘-k27 -L 150’. We then assembled the reads using Platanus v1.2.121 with default parameters. Contamination candidates were removed by mapping to Escherichia coli and PhiX genomes using blastn v2.2.9,22 setting the parameters to ‘-e 1e-30’. The statistics of the genome assemblies and the information of sequence libraries are summarized in Supplementary Tables S1-1 and S1-2. In order to test the quality of the reference assembly in the Egyptian fruit bat, we additionally constructed a fosmid library, which was end-sequenced using ABI 3730xl sequencers.2.3. Identification of protein-coding genes in bat genomesThe protein-coding genes in the genomes of Egyptian fruit bat and Leschenault’s rousette were identified based on the alignment with annotated gene sequences of 14 mammals (cat, dog, horse, cow, hedgehog, human, macaque, mouse, rat, Black flying fox, Little brown bat, Brandt’s bat, David’s myotis, and Large flying fox; Supplementary Table S2) that are available in the database. The sequences for each gene of the 14 mammals were aligned to the two bat genomes by using BLAT23 to identify approximate gene loci. The BLAT alignments of the gene sequences to the genomes were refined by the exonerate software to estimate the exon–intron boundaries.24In addition to the homology-based identification, RNA-seq-based transcript reconstruction and ab initio gene prediction were performed to identify the protein coding genes. RNA of primary culture cells from the kidney of the Egyptian fruit bat was extracted by using TRIzol reagent (Thermo Fisher). A total of 122,017,734 paired-end reads of mRNA (Illumina-HiSeq, 101 bp) were aligned to the genomes using tophat.25 In total, 97,696,475 and 88,528,280 paired-end reads could be mapped to the genome sequences of R. aegyptiacus and R. leschenaultii, respectively. Transcript structures were reconstructed using AUGUSTUS26 based on the tophat alignment of the Illumina reads to the bat genomes. The expression levels of the reconstructed genes were computed using cufflinks27 based on the tophat alignment of the Illumina reads to the genomes. A total of 8,079 genes were expressed with fragments per kilobase of transcript per million of reads mapped (FPKM) = 1 in the kidney-derived primary cultured cells. Examples are shown in Supplementary Fig. S1. Ab initio genes were obtained by using Genscan28 and SNAP.29 The genomic sequences were cut to seven megabase-long fragments, and Genscan was run on each fragment. The genes identified were assigned to gene loci based on the overlap of exons on the same strand, and the redundancies of the transcripts were removed. Only transcripts annotated with the start codon (ATG) and introns flanked by canonical splice dinucleotide pairs (GT-AG, GC-AG, and AT-AC) were retained. A total of 46,249 and 47,073 transcripts were annotated over 20,005 and 20,913 gene loci, respectively, on the genomes of the Egyptian fruit bat and Leschenault’s rousette. The completeness of the gene determination was evaluated by using BUSCO.30 Similarly, we assessed protein-coding genes on the genomes of four other bat species, the Straw-coloured fruit bat, the Greater false vampire bat, the Greater horseshoe bat, and the Straw-coloured fruit bat.15 Due to fragmental nature of these genome assemblies (N50: 15–27 kb), however, we did not use the thresholds of initial codon and splice sites as used in the annotation of the genomes of the Egyptian fruit bat and Leschenault’s rousette. We identified the longest ORF in each transcript mapped by exonerate by using TransDecoder (https://github.com/TransDecoder/TransDecoder/blob/master/TransDecoder.LongOrfs) and used it as the gene annotation. We identified 28,367–31,441 transcripts in 19,296–20,272 gene loci on these genomes (Supplementary Table S3). The ratio of complete genes of the annotated genes evaluated by BUSCO was 53.8–76.0%.Additional to this annotation, the tandemly duplicated receptor genes, including ORs, taste receptors (T1Rs and T2Rs), vomeronasal receptors (V1Rs and V2Rs), formyl peptide receptors (FPRs), and TAARs, were annotated separately. Olfactory receptors were identified by the method described previously.31,32 The other receptor genes were identified using another protocol.33 In short, we obtained protein sequences of mammalian T1Rs, T2Rs, FPRs, V1Rs, V2Rs, and TAARs from the NCBI RefSeq database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/). The redundant sequences, which contain more than 80% identity as identified by CD-HIT34, were removed to establish representative query sequences. For T1Rs, we used only the transmembrane regions as query sequences. We used the NCBI Conserved Domains database to annotate the 7-transmembrane domains of T1Rs. Using the query sequences, we performed a tblastn search against the whole-genome sequence assemblies available in GenBank (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/). The taxonomic classification and the accession numbers of the whole-genome sequences are summarized in Supplementary Table S2. The exon–intron structure of each sequence, which was obtained by tblastn, was predicted with the exonerate program24 using translated query sequences as protein models. The resulting hit sequences were classified into ‘intact’, ‘truncated’, and ‘pseudo-genes’. Due to an assembly issue, the ‘truncated’ genes included poly ‘N’ sequences. In order to estimate the gene copy numbers, in these analyses, we treated the ‘truncated’ genes as ‘putatively intact’. The pseudo-genes include inactivating mutations in the coding region. The resulting genes were assessed to determine whether they encode the chemosensory receptors of interest using blastx searches and GHOSTZ35 against the UniRef50 database (https://www.uniprot.org/help/uniref). We used the Framework for Annotating Translatable Exons (FATE), which is available in GitHub (https://github.com/Hikoyu/FATE), for the automation of the procedures described above.2.4. Phylogenetic tree constructionWe constructed a phylogenetic tree based on the single-copy orthologous gene sets of mammals, as previously reported by Wu et al.,36 to elucidate the phylogenetic relationships of megabats with other mammals. Briefly, the nucleotide sequences of the 6,365 protein-coding genes of the two megabat species and 22 other mammalian species (Supplementary Table S2) were aligned using the PRANK software v.17042737 in codon level. Sites that are shared by <70% of the species were removed from the alignment. Among the 6,365 genes, 2,093 genes were listed for all species, and were used for the analyses. The gene tree was constructed using RAxML software, v8.1.1238 using the GTR+G+I model with 1,000 bootstrap replicates for each 2,093 gene. We collected the best tree for all 2,093 genes, which were used to infer the coalescent species tree with branch length by ASTRAL-III.39 The node support of the species tree was obtained by 1,000 replicates of bootstrapping. Branch length shown in the tree indicates the branch length in coalescent units.402.5. Repeat analysisWe used the genome of Leschenault’s rousette for the identification of TEs, based on two approaches, including de novo characterization of TEs and identification of homologous copies of known TEs in another megabat, the large flying fox (Supplementary Table S2). In the first approach, RepeatModeler ver. 1.0.8 (http://www.repeatmasker.org/RepeatModeler.html) was used to obtain a collection of repetitive sequences. For each of the preliminary consensus sequences, we conducted a local nucleotide blast search (r = 2, G = 5, E = 2, with an e-value cutoff of 10-10) and collected 80–100 copies along with their 10-kp flanking sequences. The copy sequences were aligned using MAFFT ver. 7.41 The alignment was manually modified using MEGA 5.042 and a consensus sequence was re-constructed. The consensus sequence was used for the next round of the blast search, as described above, to obtain additional copies. This procedure was repeated until a full-length consensus sequence was completed. The full-length TEs were characterized and classified based on the sequence structure, including terminal inverted repeats and long terminal repeats (LTRs), coding proteins such as transposase and reverse transcriptase, and by comparison with known elements using RepeatMasker ver. 4.0.6 (http://repeatmasker.org), CENSOR,43 and RTclass1.44 For the second approach, a TE library of another megabat, the large flying fox, including 65 TE families which were obtained from RepBase,45 was used as a query for a homology search against Leschenault’s rousette. The local nucleotide blast search, alignment of the copy sequences, and reconstruction of the consensus sequence were conducted as described above. A similar blast search was also conducted using 102 TE families of a microbat (the little brown bat, Supplementary Table S2) library; however, no additional novel TEs were found except in the results from the two approaches listed above. All of the newly characterized 118 TE (sub) families were designated in conformity with the RepBase classification.The repeat contents of the two Rousettus genomes were estimated using RepeatMasker with the sensitive option (-s) of cross-match search using the Rousettus repeat library which we developed here. The TE contents, such as the number of copies and length, were summarized based on their divergence (%) from the consensus sequence at the family/subfamily levels by using in-house Perl scripts. The TE contents of other species were summarized based on the RepeatMasker output (http://www.repeatmasker.org/genomicDatasets/RMGenomicDatasets.html).2.6. Detection of positively selected genes in the fruit batsOrthologous genes under relaxed selection on megabat lineages were identified from the aligned 6,365 single-copy genes. On every alignment, we used the codeml branch model in PAML 4.846 to detect the elevation of the dN/dS ratio (the non-synonymous substitution rate to the synonymous substitution rate) on stem and crown megabat branches. The species tree shown in Fig. 1 was used as a guide tree in the analysis. Likelihood ratio tests and inspections of the P-value were used to compare likelihoods between two models: (i) that assumed the megabat lineages as foreground branches; and (ii) that assumed the dN/dS ratio was not altered in all branches (null hypothesis), to evaluate the significance of the elevation of the dN/dS ratio for megabat branches. We performed further analyses for the genes of interest using the codeml branch-site models for analysing the positive selection on each site. In the branch-site test, we tested stem and crown megabats as the foreground branches and used microbats and outgroup species, including human, macaque, mouse, rat, cat, dog, Chinese pangolin, Sunda pangolin, bottlenose dolphin, cow, horse, hedgehog, Asian musk shrew, and common shrew, as background branches. For the branch-site test, we used two models for the analysis, including one model of a null hypothesis that assumes that the gene was under two types of selective pressures (purifying selection and neutral selection), and one model that used an alternative hypothesis to assume the gene was under three categories of selective pressures, including positive selection on the megabat branches. The likelihood ratio test comparing the likelihoods of these two models was used to evaluate the significance of the alternative model. To assess the functionality of positively selected sites, protein structure deposited in protein data bank (PDB) was used. The protein structures were depicted using the open-source version of PyMOL.47Genome-wide phylogenetic tree of 24 mammals, including 11 species of bats.

Genome assemblyWe constructed draft genomes of the Egyptian fruit bat and Leschenault’s rousette by assembling short read data into contigs and scaffolding them using Platanus v1.2.1.21 The genome of the Egyptian fruit bat is composed of 1.90 Gbp with 4,974 scaffolds (N50 = 37.2 Mbp) and the genome of Leschenault’s rousette is composed of 1.90 Gbp with 8,141 scaffolds (N50 = 32.7 Mbp) (Supplementary Tables S1-1 and S1-2). The high qualities of the two genomes are demonstrated by the ratios of complete genes, which are 98.1 and 97.9%, respectively, as evaluated by BUSCO30 (Supplementary Table S3). The quality of both genomes in terms of the continuity of the scaffolds and the rate of N is high enough to facilitate genome-wide evolutionary analyses and characterization of multi-gene families. In addition, independent genome assemblies and gene annotations of the two individuals of Egyptian fruit bat determined in the previous study16 and this study may be utilized as an initial step towards the identification of the genotypic, transcriptomic, and phenotypic variation of this species in the future research.3.2. Phylogenetic relationships of bats among mammalsFigure 1 shows the maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree with the time scale for 24 mammals, including 11 bats (five megabats and six microbats) based on 2,093 single-copy orthologous gene sets. Four species of Euarchontoglires, including humans, macaca, mouse, and rat, were used as outgroups. The tree successfully highlights the evolutionary history of Laurasiatherian mammals in that Eulipotyphla diverged first among them. In this phylogenetic tree, Chiroptera diverged after Eulipotyphla; however, the bootstrap probability (BP) supporting this node was not so high (63.5). In addition, the grouping of Pegasoferae (Chiroptera, Perissodactyla, and Carnivora), which was originally proposed by the insertion of retroposons7 and supported by several genome-wide analyses,13,14 was not supported. Given that the BPs for the inter-relationships of Cetartiodactyla, Perissodactyla (Carnivora + Pholidota), and Chiroptera were relatively low (63.7, 63.5) and the branch lengths were markedly short, it is highly likely that the initial divergence of Laurasiatherian mammals occurred rapidly during evolution. Such rapid speciation events may hamper reconstruction of the consistent tree topology for these groups.8,48 Importantly, as it was shown in the previous studies,5,49,50 the reciprocal monophyly of Yangochiroptera and Yinpterochiroptera was successfully supported in this analysis, suggesting that the megabats are nested in microbat lineages. Although it is difficult to estimate the ancestral state in the megabat ancestors due to the rarity of the fossil record, the phylogenetic tree suggests that several distinct characteristics in megabats, including the well-developed visual system, frugivorous diet, and the absence of echolocation, evolved in a short period of time during evolution from a ‘microbat-like’ ancestor. We next focussed on assessing the signatures for such adaptive evolution in these groups based on the genome-wide comparative analyses.3.3. TEs in the two Rousettus genomesIn both the Leschenault’s rousette and Egyptian fruit bat genomes, TEs account for ~35% of the genome, including SINEs (3.9%), LINEs (21%), LTR retrotransposons (6.2%), and DNA transposons (4.0%) (Supplementary Table S4 and Fig. S2). It is notable that the proportions of TEs in megabats, including the two Rousettus species and the large flying fox, are considerably lower as compared to the levels in other mammals, such as humans, where nearly half of the genome is covered by TEs (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S2). Consistent with the previous observations, it is also interesting that the proportion of TEs is generally correlated with the genome size in mammals51,52 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Co-variation between an accumulation of TEs and DNA loss by large segmental deletions is considered a major contributing factor to determine the genome size.50 Therefore, the smaller genome sizes in the megabats may be due to a lower activity of TEs, at least in part. Indeed, our analysis revealed that the number of young (recently retrotransposed) TE copies in the megabat genomes is very small (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S3). As exemplified by the microbat Myotis lucifugus, where the number of TEs representing <5% divergence from the consensus sequence is 180,000 (6.5% among all TE copies; Supplementary Fig. S3) consistent with the previous studies,53 in general, young TEs constitute a few percent among all TEs in mammalian genomes. However, the copy numbers of young TEs is only 2,900 (0.15%) and 7,300 (0.38%) for the Rousettus species and large flying fox, respectively (Fig. 2BSupplementary Fig. S3). Low copy number of recently (retro-)transposed SINEs in megabats. (A) Copy number of clade-specific SINEs (i.e. excluding common SINEs, such as MIRs, AmnSINEs, and LF-SINEs) were compared among the three megabats, one microbat, and eight other mammals. Representative SINE families in each mammalian clade are shown. (B) Age distribution of occupied length (left) and proportion (right) of TE classes (SINE, LINE, LTR retrotransposons, rolling-circle transposons [RC], and DNA transposons) in the four bat genomes.

(B) Age distribution of occupied length (left) and proportion (right) of TE classes (SINE, LINE, LTR retrotransposons, rolling-circle transposons [RC], and DNA transposons) in the four bat genomes. Copies of lower divergence from the consensus sequence represent TEs inserted more recently.The small proportion of young TEs is partly accounted for the low frequency of retrotransposition events in megabat-specific SINEs (Fig. 2). In general, different types of SINE families are distributed for each mammalian clade, such as order, sub-order, or family.52 In megabats, the only known active SINEs are the 5S rRNA-derived MEG SINEs.54 It should be noted that Rousettus genomes contain no more than 23,000 copies of the MEG-related SINEs, which cover 0.21% of the genome. However, clade-specific SINEs are, in general, retrotranspositionally highly active, with 105–106 copies present in each mammalian genome (Fig. 2A). The large flying fox (Pteropus vampyrus) also has only 22,000 copies of MEG-related SINEs. Based on the wide distribution of MEG SINEs in megabats, including Rousettus, Macroglossus, Eonycteris, and Cynopterus,54 the origin of MEG can be traced back to the common ancestor of megabats, which existed at least 24 million years ago.49 It is possible that such a low retrotranspositional activity of the SINEs found in Rousettus and Pteropus is observed widely among megabats. It has been demonstrated that flying vertebrates, including bats, have substantially lost TEs and have smaller genome sizes in association with cellular metabolic constraints.55,56 The small proportion of MEG SINEs in the megabats may also be a result of the constraint related to their powered flight.Another notable TE family is LINE-1 (L1), as it has been reported that the retrotranspositional activity of L1 has been lost in megabats.57 It is unlikely that the extinction of L1 resulted from the quiescence of L1 itself, because a synthesized sequence of the reconstructed megabat L1 is capable of retrotransposition in human HeLa cells.58 In addition, we identified that in addition to L1, all types of TEs have the least activity in megabats among the mammals investigated (Fig. 2B). This low activity of young TEs may be due to an unknown megabat-specific mechanism for TE repression or a result of extensive DNA loss during the past tens of millions of years.One of the possible mechanisms by which TE activity may be tightly repressed is an antiviral immune system in megabats. Suggesting that the Egyptian fruit bat may possess a novel mode of antiviral defense,16 several antiviral-related genes are known to have expanded in this bat. For example, ribonuclease L, an interferon-inducible endoribonuclease that cleaves viral RNAs,59 evolved under relaxed selective constraint in bats.16 Ribonuclease L is also known to restrict retrotransposition of human L1 and mouse IAP elements in human cells.60 In addition, several other factors that restrict retrotransposition in humans and mice are known to be involved in an antiviral immune system.61 Thus, it is possible that a unique antiviral mechanism against exogenous parasites (i.e. viruses) is secondarily used for the restriction of the endogenous retroelements. As general mobilization of SINEs in mammals relies on the L1 machinery, the restriction of megabat L1 could limit the MEG SINE activity.62 The low activity of TEs may partly contribute to the small genome size (Supplementary Fig. S2), which could also be advantageous with respect to cell size and metabolic constraints in megabats as well as other flying vertebrates55,56. Therefore, the unusual characteristics of the TEs, likely shared among megabats, are an important example to study the molecular mechanisms underlying restriction of retrotransposition. Such future studies may shed light on the reason why bats have such compact genomes. It also remains unknown why Ves SINEs in microbats are active, whereas the genome size is relatively small among mammals (Fig. 2). The difference in the SINE activity between megabats and microbats may be affected by a possibly distinct antiviral immune system between the two groups, given that expansion of some antiviral-related genes occurred specifically in megabats.163.4. Chemosensory receptor genes (taste, olfaction, and pheromone)Most of the chemosensory receptors are encoded by multi-gene families, allowing animals to detect highly diversified chemicals in the environment. The previously published studies have shown that the collections of the chemosensory receptor genes are flexible and highly variable among mammals, including the ORs, taste receptors (T1Rs and T2Rs), vomeronasal receptors (V1Rs and V2Rs), FPRs, and TAARs.63 The number of certain chemosensory receptor gene families has been shown to have a strong correlation with the degree of dependence on these ligand chemicals for survival.32,64,65 Several studies have revealed that bats lost several chemosensory receptor genes, such as T1R1 for umami,66 and V1Rs for pheromone(s)67 that may be due to the specific sensory adaptation in the ancestor of these groups. It is possible that megabats re-allocated the diversity in chemosensory receptor genes as a sensory trade-off, given that megabats have experienced the secondary loss of echolocation ability, which is one of the most specialized senses in bats.68 To examine this possibility, we comprehensively characterized the chemosensory receptor genes and compared their diversity by focussing on whether or not the repertoires in megabats show notable differences from those in microbats.Our comparative genomic analyses of chemosensory receptor genes in the genomes of 25 mammals revealed that the copy number of the intact genes and pseudo-genes show a certain variation among bat species. In T1Rs, the absence of T1R1, the umami receptor, in all of the bats that we analysed is consistent with the findings of the previous studies.66 All megabats possess two T1Rs (T1R2 and T1R3), whereas microbats are somewhat variable, in that they can possess no (greater false vampire bat), one (little brown bat), or two (Brandt’s bat, greater horseshoe bat) T1Rs (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S5). It is noteworthy that all megabats possess T1R2, which is the sweet receptor, suggesting the importance of sweet taste for their frugivorous lifestyle. No intact T1Rs in the greater false vampire bat could be explained by their specific adaptation for a carnivorous diet, which resembles the blood-feeding activity of the vampire bat (Desmodus rotundus), which also lost T1Rs.66,69Comparison of the copy numbers of seven chemosensory receptor genes for 24 mammals. (A) The number of intact, truncated, and pseudo-genes is indicated in blue, yellow, and red, respectively. We treated the truncated genes as ‘putatively intact’. The dotted lines show the variation in the number of intact + ‘putatively intact’ genes among mammals. It should be noted that the number of TAARs is obviously higher in megabats than in microbats. (B) Phylogenetic tree of intact TAARs in 24 mammals. Only the intact genes were included in the tree. The TAARs of the Egyptian fruit bat and Leschenault’s rousette are indicated by the square (green) and triangle (blue). It is obvious that the TAARs of subfamilies seven and eight were expanded in two Rousettus bats. Zebrafish TAAR13c in the NCBI database was used as an outgroup. Mouse TAAR1-9 in the NCBI database was used as an indicator for each TAAR subfamily. Accession codes for these database-derived genes are available in Supplementary Fig. S4.Comparison of the copy numbers of seven chemosensory receptor genes for 24 mammals.

Mouse TAAR1-9 in the NCBI database was used as an indicator for each TAAR subfamily. Accession codes for these database-derived genes are available in Supplementary Fig. S4.As for T2Rs, which are bitter taste receptors, the copy numbers are relatively smaller in megabats than those in microbats (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S5). The smaller number of T2Rs in megabats can also be explained by their frugivorous diet, as compared with that of microbats, which are mostly insectivores. Indeed, the repertoires of T2Rs in primates have a strong correlation with their diet,70 suggesting the importance of T2Rs for feeding adaptation in mammals.We identified little variation between megabats and microbats in FPRs, which are expressed in the sensory neurons of the vomeronasal organ and mediate innate avoidance behaviours (Fig. 3ASupplementary Table S5).71 Suggesting that FPR-mediated chemo-detection is not directly linked with the difference in their habitats, mega- and microbats both possess two to eight FPRs. However, a previous study, by comparing the orthologous sequences among a broad range of mammals, found the signatures for the operation of positive selection in FPRs.72 Therefore, to examine the possible contribution of FPRs to the adaptive evolution of megabats, more detailed investigation is necessary by focussing on the dN/dS values among orthologous FPR sequences of many bat species, which are lacking at present.There was an extensive reduction in V1Rs, which are known to be expressed in VNO neurons of mammals and detect various pheromones,73–75 in both megabats and microbats (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S5). Especially, only one V1R was found in the genomes of megabats. The reduction of V1Rs revealed in this study is consistent with the findings of the previously published studies.67 The inactivation of TRPC2s76,77 and ancV1Rs,78,79 which is responsible for VNO function, suggested the degeneration of VNOs in most bat lineages including megabats. Although most bats do not possess intact V1Rs, Parnell’s mustached bat possesses four intact V1Rs (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S5), which is consistent with the presence of the VNO in this species.80 In addition, recent study has suggested that there are a substantial number of V1Rs in distantly related groups of phyllostomids and miniopterids, which possess an intact VNO, suggesting that they retained V1R-mediated chemical communication.77,81 Therefore, the ancestor of all extant bats is expected to possess an intact VNO, as well as a certain number of V1Rs, that were independently degenerated after the divergence of each family, including megabats (Pteropodidae). Namely, the loss of echolocation and the degeneration of the VNO occurred spontaneously in the ancestor of megabats.V2Rs are expressed in the basal region of the VNO neurons74,82,83 and peptide pheromones were detected in mice.84,85 However, intact V2Rs have been identified only in a limited number of mammals, such as rodents,63 mouse lemurs,86 and opossum.87 Our comprehensive analysis failed to find intact putative V2Rs in the genomes of all bats and most of other mammals. This result suggests that, before the acquisition of the echolocation ability, the V2R-mediated pheromone detection system has already been lost in the common ancestor of all extant bat lineages. It is noteworthy that the hedgehog and the horse possess seven and one intact V2Rs, respectively (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S5). This provides the first description of intact V2Rs in the genomes of Laurasiatherian mammals. More detailed analyses may provide insight into the V2R-mediated pheromone detection system in these species.One of the most intriguing results in the chemosensory receptor genes was obtained from TAARs. Trace amine receptors have been believed to function as receptors for trace amines, for example, tyramine and octopamine in the brain.88 However, a recent study revealed that TAARs may be expressed primarily or exclusively in the MOE,89 and are responsible for detecting volatile amines, including ethological odors that evoke innate animal behavioural responses.90 In this study, we revealed that the number of TAARs was increased in the common ancestor of megabats. In particular, the number of TAARs, which were identified to be from five to seven copies in microbats, increased to more than 15 copies in megabats. In particular, Leschenault’s rousette possess 38 putatively intact (29 intact and 9 truncated) TAARs, which is the largest number identified among mammals (Fig. 3A;Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). The phylogenetic analyses of intact TAARs for the 24 mammals clearly demonstrated that the expansion of the genes in the two Rousettus bats, including the Egyptian fruit bat and Leschenault’s rousette, occurred in subfamilies seven and eight in a species-specific manner (Fig. 3B;Supplementary Fig. S4 and Table S6). Eyun et al.91 also reported a high copy number of TAARs in one megabat, the large flying fox; however, the repertoire was quite different from that of these two Rousettus bats (Fig. 3A;Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). Although TAARs were expanded in subfamilies seven and eight in the two Rousettus species, they were expanded only in subfamily seven in the Java fruit bat. The number of intact genes, as well as the pseudo-genes, was highly variable among the megabats, suggesting that birth and death of TAARs were quite active. Phylogenetic, as well as copy number, analyses suggest that TAARs have provided a large contribution to some process of adaptive evolution and diversification of megabats. Interestingly, Pavlovich et al.16 revealed the gene expansion of Mhc genes in the genomes of the Egyptian fruit bat, suggesting novel modes of antiviral defense. Thus, the Mhc genes and TAARs were both expanded in megabats. Santos et al.92 reported that TAARs may be a key mediator in Mhc-dependent mating choices in the sac-winged bat (Saccopteryx bilineata). Based on these findings, it is possible that the megabats use diversified TAARs for mate choice, by taking advantage of Mhc-related molecules that are also diversified. Functional experiments investigating TAARs and mating in megabats may provide insight into the possible link between TAARs and Mhc genes.ORs, which are expressed in the MOE, have undergone extensive expansion and contraction that may be associated with environmental adaptations. In ORs, we also revealed the notable increase of the genes in megabats, which is more evident in two Rousettus bats, including the Egyptian fruit bat and Leschenault’s rousette (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table S5). Although the copy numbers of putatively intact (intact and truncated) ORs span from 249 to 543 in microbats, those of megabats ranges from 401 to 740. The increase in the number of ORs in megabats may be the signature for the re-allocation in response, leading to the loss of the echolocation ability in the megabat ancestor. Hayden et al.65 identified convergent OR patterns linked to frugivorous diet in megabats and New World fruit-eating microbats (phyllostomids). Given that the increase in the ORs is more extensive, these patterns of ORs are not only linked to the frugivorous diet, but also to some other roles, such as predator avoidance and social communication.By extensively analysing the copy-number variations of chemosensory receptor genes between megabats and microbats, we revealed obvious differences in TAARs and ORs, both of which are expressed in the MOE. It is possible that the contraction of VNO-mediated chemo-detection and echolocation in megabats may lead to the expansion of chemo-detection genes expressed in the MOE. In addition, it is noteworthy that the repertoires of TAARs and ORs were obviously differentiated even between closely related two species belonging to the Rousettus, suggesting that birth and death of these genes are quite active in this genus (Fig. 3A and B; Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). The results propose the possibility that two Rousettus bats are particularly dependent on olfaction through TAARs and ORs.3.5. Genes with elevated evolutionary rates in megabatsIn addition to the candidate approach, which focussed on retroposons and chemosensory receptor genes, we also performed global analyses on the protein-coding genes of megabats. The elevation of dN/dS ratios were examined for the 6,365 single-copy orthologous genes35 using the branch model of codeml implemented in PAML4.8.46 The likelihood ratio tests and the inspection of P-value identified that the elevation of dN/dS ratios (P < 0.05) was significant in 246 genes (Supplementary Table S7). As shown by the enrichment analyses for the resultant 246 genes using WebGESTALT,93 the elevation of the dN/dS ratios in megabats was remarkable in genes related to the immune system and protein catabolism (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S8).

We revealed the episodic evolution by showing the elevation of dN/dS ratios in many immune response genes in megabat lineages (Table 1). The tolerance for zoonotic viruses without overt pathology in bats are consistent with the episodic evolution in immune response genes. Namely, co-evolution of viruses and immune system in these species may be facilitated by the adaptive evolution. Further molecular biological and physiological investigations of these candidate genes are of primary importance in elucidating how bats tolerate infections by various zoonotic viruses.Interestingly, the elevation of the dN/dS ratio of protein catabolism was also reported in the tyrosine aminotransferase gene (TAT) in megabats.97 To further investigate the evolution of the protein catabolism pathway in megabats, we focussed on another representative gene, 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase (HADH), in which the elevation of the dN/dS ratio was significant in the branch model (Table 1; Supplementary Tables S9 and S10). HADH is involved in the degradation of Ile, Val, Lys, and Tyr to convert them into energy via the citric acid (TCA) cycle (Fig. 4A). The branch-site test for HADH (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S10) revealed that seven sites were positively selected with a posterior probability (P) of >95%, including three sites with a P of >99% (Fig. 4B). The likelihood for the operation of positive selection was not significant, as only a few sites were detected as positively selected (11%, Supplementary Table S10). We then mapped the positively selected sites on the human HADH dimer structure (PDB: 1F0Y, Fig. 4C). Although the positively selected sites were not located on the ligand (NAD and CAA) binding sites, it was of interest that four sites (R221, E229, A247, and L286) were located on the dimer interface (Fig. 4C). The mutations on these four residues change electric charges or polarities, such as R221Y, E229N, A247S, and L286S, suggesting that dimer formation is likely to be interrupted and enzyme catalysis is degraded. Shen et al.97 identified the significantly low activity of TAT in megabats and discussed that the elevation of the dN/dS ratio in TAT may be the relaxation of purifying selection in response to their frugivorous diet. Megabats may utilize the ingested proteins for the synthesis of new proteins, rather than for energy production through catabolism, as their diets, which include fruits and nectar, are rich in carbohydrates but poor in protein. Accordingly, it is possible that the megabats are less dependent on the protein catabolism pathway. In this study, we provide additional and inclusive evidence which suggests that the evolutionary constraints on genes for protein catabolism were relaxed due to the adaptation for frugivorous diets.

ConclusionIn summary, our comparative genomic analyses revealed several distinct signatures for adaptive evolution in megabats. (i) The activity of TEs is considerably lower compared to other mammals, which is possibly related to a defense mechanism against viruses. The small size of the genomes, which may be due to the low activity of TEs, could be advantageous in association with cellular metabolic constrains of flying organisms. (ii) TAARs and ORs, which function in the neurons of MOE, show specific expansions, implying the important contribution of olfaction in their adaptation processes. (iii) Positive selection in genes for immunity may suggests the co-evolution of immune system and viruses, providing crucial insights into the mechanism of asymptomatic infection of bats for zoonotic viruses as a host reservoir. (iv) Positive selection in genes for protein catabolism is consistent with the ability of frugivorous feeding that is one of the adaptive characters specific to megabats.Supplementary dataThe supplementary data are available at DNARES online.The authors thank Mr. Yujiro Kawabe for the illustration of the animals in Fig. 1.

IntroductionThe decline in global crop diversity constitutes a potential threat to food and nutrition security.1 Recently, the increasing global vulnerability of the food supply caused by climate change and rapid population growth has made underutilized, orphan, and neglected crops potentially very important for future food and nutrition security.2 One such potential underutilized crop is quinoa (Chenopodium quinoa Willd.),3 an annual pseudocereal of the Amaranthaceae family that also includes spinach (Spinacia oleracea L.) and sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.). Quinoa seeds and leaves have exceptional nutritional profiles, as they contain a constellation of minerals, vitamins, dietary fibre, fats, and high-quality proteins with a balanced amino acid profile.4–7 Quinoa also thrives in a wide range of marginal environments in terms of altitude, annual precipitation, temperature, and soil conditions and is thus resistant to multiple abiotic stresses such as high salinity, drought, low temperatures, and frost.8–13Quinoa was originally domesticated in the Andean region of South America at least 7,500 years ago14 and served as a staple food for indigenous people of the Andes in Pre-Columbian times.15 However, Spanish conquerors in the 1500s forbade the cultivation and consumption of quinoa because it was worshiped as a sacred ‘mother grain’ used in indigenous ceremonies in non-Christian religion.15 Therefore, in contrast to potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.), which also originated in the Andes but expanded globally after their discovery by the Conquistadors, quinoa remained a neglected crop in South America for about 500 years until the 20th century.16 In 1975, the National Academy of Sciences of the United States (NAS) selected quinoa as one of the 36 underexploited plants with promising economic value.17 In 1993, the US National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) took an interest in quinoa because it possesses desirable food qualities for astronauts on long-duration space missions.18 The United Nations declared 2013 as the International Year of Quinoa to raise public awareness of the nutritional benefits of this durable plant in terms of food and nutrition security worldwide.19 Nowadays, although quinoa is cultivated mostly in Bolivia and Peru, quinoa cultivation is being attempted in over 95 countries.19High salinity stress poses a major environmental threat to agriculture, impairing crop production in ~20% of global irrigated land.20 Seed germination and subsequent seedling establishment are crucial steps in the life cycle of plants, especially under harsh environments such as salt-affected lands.21 Since quinoa has been recognized as a salt-tolerant crop and a potential candidate for introduction into marginal areas,22 many studies have focussed on salinity tolerance during germination in quinoa.21 However, as few studies have made use of genotyped quinoa accessions, little is known about the molecular basis of salt tolerance, a prerequisite for the improvement of crop yield on saline soils.Quinoa is an allotetraploid (2n = 4x = 36) with an estimated genome size of 1.5 Gbp, composed of the two sub-genomes A and B.23–26 The underlying genome complexity caused by its allotetraploidy have hampered molecular analysis of quinoa genes over the years. However, the quinoa genome was recently sequenced by three independent research groups,12,27,28 opening the door to revealing the molecular mechanisms governing the development of the mysterious quinoa plant. Moreover, quinoa plants exhibit partial outcrossing due to having both hermaphrodite and female flowers on the same plant,29,30 resulting in genetic heterogeneity that has also impeded the rigorous molecular analysis of quinoa.To overcome this substantial limitation, we generated 136 inbred quinoa lines as a basis for molecular studies aimed at identifying genes and characterizing gene function in quinoa through large-scale genotyping and phenotyping efforts. Armed with the inbred lines, we performed a genotyping-by-sequencing (GBS) analysis and thus detected 5,753 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the quinoa genome. Based on the SNPs, we show that our quinoa inbred lines are genetically divided into three sub-populations and that the highlands of South America near Bolivia and Peru are the centre of diversity of cultivated quinoa. Further, we analysed the phenotypes of the inbred quinoa lines, which we combined with our genetic data into a heatmap that allows a succinct visual overview of the genotype–phenotype relationship among the inbred quinoa lines. We also established that, unlike the northern highland lines, the seeds of the lowland and southern highland lines can germinate under high salinity conditions (600 mM NaCl). These findings will contribute to the molecular basis needed to compensate for the lost breeding opportunities and studies of quinoa over the past 500 years.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials, generation of quinoa inbred lines, and growth conditionsQuinoa seeds (except Kd and Iw lines) were obtained from the Germplasm Resources Information Network (GRIN) of the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) (Supplementary Table S1). The sequenced and model inbred quinoa line Kd was established at Japan International Research Center for Agricultural Sciences (JIRCAS) by single-seed propagation in the absence of all other quinoa plants for over 20 years at Kyoto University, Japan.12 Another quinoa line used for plant virus research, Iw, was kindly provided by Dr Nobuyuki Yoshikawa, Iwate University, Japan.31 Inbred quinoa lines used in this study were generated by self-crossing through single-seed descent of the quinoa lines collected at JIRCAS in Tsukuba, Japan, as described previously.12 The seeds of inbred quinoa lines derived from the USDA were named J001–J144, excluding J062 and J070, because a USDA accession often contains seeds with multiple distinct phenotypes in terms of colour and size and none of the J062 and J070 seeds could germinate (Supplementary Table S1). For the bulking of inbred quinoa seeds, all inflorescences of each plant were covered with non-woven pollination bags (Rizo, Tsukuba, Japan) to prevent cross-pollination in phytotrons or a greenhouse.Quinoa plants were grown on soil in pots as described previously,12 with minor modifications. Quinoa seeds were sown in a peat moss mixture (Jiffy Mix, Sakata Seeds, Yokohama, Japan) in a cell tray and were allowed to germinate in a growth chamber at 25°C under a 12-h-light/12-h-dark cycle (75 ± 25 µmol photons/m2/s). After 13–14 days, the seedlings were transferred to a standard potting mix (Tsuchitaro, Sumitomo Forestry, Tokyo, Japan) in 1.2-l plant pots and were grown under ambient light in temperature-controlled phytotrons at JIRCAS with a temperature of 25 ± 5°C and relative humidity of 55 ± 25%. For the bulking of inbred quinoa seeds for genotyping and phenotyping, quinoa plants were grown under ambient light in a greenhouse with a temperature of 27 ± 5°C and relative humidity of 55 ± 40%. For the phenotypic evaluation of the quinoa inbred lines at Tottori University, Japan, quinoa seeds were sown in sandy soil from the Tottori sand dunes in a cell tray and were allowed to germinate under ambient light in a greenhouse with a temperature of 18 ± 13°C. After 7 days, the seedlings were transferred to sandy soil in 1.5-l plant pots and were grown in the greenhouse.2.2. GBS and SNP detectionWe used 136 of the 142 lines for GBS analysis, since we needed to arrange the total number of samples to be a multiple of 48, including 8 control replicates and in accordance with the combination of the adapters. Total genomic DNA was extracted from fresh quinoa leaves as described previously,32 using the AP1 buffer from the DNAeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) instead of the lysis buffer used by Yabe et al.32 GBS reactions were carried out as described previously33 with minor modifications. EcoRI and PstI were used as restriction enzymes in this study. Barcode adaptors are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Barcode-labelled amplicons were size-selected (range 200 - 500 bp) with AMPure XP beads (Beckman Coulter) and were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq2500 System at Macrogen Japan (Kyoto, Japan) as paired-end reads. The reads generated in this study are available from the DDBJ/EMBL/NCBI under the accession numbers listed in Supplementary Table S1. In addition to GBS data, we used published whole genome sequencing (WGS) data of quinoa12,27 for SNP detection; the relevant accessions are listed in Supplementary Table S2. Low quality reads and adaptors were trimmed using Trimmomatic-0.3634 with the options ‘SLIDINGWINDOW:4:25’ and ‘MINLEN:40’. The adaptor sequences used were ‘CACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT’ and ‘ACCGCTCTTCCGATCTGTAA’. The trimmed paired-end reads were mapped against the quinoa reference genome (Cq_PI614886_genome_V1_pseudomolecule.fa27) using BWA 0.7.1535 with -L 10 and -B 10 options. Single-end reads were filtered out from BAM files using samtools 1.3.1.36 We then carried out a local realignment procedure using RealignerTargetCreator and IndelRealigner in GATK 3.7.37 SNPs were detected using UnifiedGenotyper in GATK 3.7 with the option -out_mode EMIT_ALL_CONFIDENT_SITES. Heterozygous variants and nucleotide sites supported by fewer than three reads were converted to missing data using Tassel 5.2.3838 and VCFtools 0.1.13,39 respectively. Nucleotide sites with a minimum mean depth of 10 and with proportion of max-missing data over 0.8 were filtered using VCFtools 0.1.13.392.3. Construction of the phylogenetic tree and structure analysisSince the depth of WGS reads27 was much lower than those of GBS reads obtained in this study, the WGS data were largely eliminated if the uniform filter conditions were used in all analyses. Therefore, we used different filter conditions and plant materials for each analysis (Supplementary Table S3). For STRUCTURE analysis, we used 149 quinoa lines (136 GBS and 13 WGS samples). Heterozygous variants were converted to missing data using Tassel 5.2.38.38 Minimum coverage depth was set to 3, and nucleotide sites with a proportion of max-missing data over 0.8 were filtered using VCFtools 0.1.13. We performed a population structure analysis using a model-based clustering method implemented in the STRUCTURE 2.3.4 software.40 The algorithm was run with a burn-in length of 100,000 followed by 100,000 Markov Chain Monte Carlo simulations for estimating parameters. At least 10 runs were performed to estimate the mean likelihood for a number of populations (K) from 1 to 10 using the admixture model and correlated allele frequencies. An average log-likelihood value, LnP(D), and <U+0394>K41 was calculated across all runs for each K to infer the best fit to the data, as measured by the likelihood score. Lines with membership probabilities of <80% for all groups were assigned to ‘admixed’ lines. For construction of the phylogenetic tree and principal component analysis (PCA), we used GBS data from 136 quinoa lines and WGS data from 13 quinoa accessions and 2 accessions of C. hircinum (a wild relative of cultivated quinoa). The resulting dataset, consisting of 1.54 Mbp derived from 7,586 SNPs, was used for Neighbour-joining (NJ) analysis. In the NJ analysis, we used SEQBOOT with 100 replicates, followed by DNAdist (with Kimura 2-parameter method), Neighbor and Consensus programmes from the PHYLIP package 3.6 (http://www.evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip.htlm (last accessed 21 September, 2020)). NJ tree was rooted using midpoint rooting and visualized by FigTree 1.4.2 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/ (last accessed 21 September, 2020)). PCA based on covariance was performed by Tassel 5.2.3838 using 7,586 SNPs. 2.4. Genetic diversity analysis and linkage disequilibriumNucleotide diversity (p) and Weir and Cockerham mean F-statistics (Fst) were calculated by VCFtools 0.1.13. Sliding window analysis of p, SNP frequency and number of SNPs were represented in a circular plot using the Circos 0.69.42 For SNP detection, we used 136 GBS samples in addition to Kd, because the sequencing depth of earlier WGS data27 was insufficient for these analyses (Supplementary Table S3). Pairwise linkage disequilibrium (LD) (r2) between the SNPs showing >0.05 minor allele frequency (MAF) was calculated using VCFtools 0.1.13. Average r2 values were calculated in non-overlapping 100-kbp intervals.2.5. Germination testSeeds were germinated in 9 cm diameter Petri dishes containing triple sheets of filter paper (Toyo Roshi Kaisha, Ltd, Tokyo, Japan), soaked with 10 ml of water or saline solution (0, 300, and 600 mM NaCl). We supplemented the 600mM NaCl saline solution with 0.2% of plant preservative mixture (Plant Cell Technology, Inc., Washington DC, USA), a broad-spectrum biocide/fungicide for plant tissue culture. Germination assays were carried out at 25 ± 1°C in the dark. We measured total hypocotyl and root length (THRL) of the germinated seedlings in 0, 300, and 600 mM saline solutions after 24 h, 4, and 14 days.2.6. Phenotypic evaluationSeeds from 136 lines were harvested at maturity, at which point we phenotyped six traits: 1,000-grain weight (TGW), plant height (PH), stem diameter (SD), leaf dry weight (LDW), seed yield per plant (SYP), and days to flowering (DF). TGW was calculated from the weight and the number of seeds counted by a WAVER IC-VAi seed counter (IDEX, Nagoya, Japan). SD was measured 1.0 cm above ground with a vernier caliper. LDW was measured after drying all leaves from individual plants harvested at maturity at 72°C for at least 72 h. SYP was measured on individual plants after husking seeds.2.7. Statistical analysis of phenotypic dataA statistical analysis was performed using the R package version 3.3.3. A Shapiro-Wilk normality test assessed whether each phenotype distribution fit within the normal distribution. Statistically significant differences between phenotypic groups were determined by one-way ANOVA and Tukey-Kramer’s HSD tests (P < 0.05). We constructed the heatmap with Microsoft Excel for Mac. PCA was performed with the ‘prcomp’ function in R. The lines with missing data were eliminated prior to PCA.2.8. Genome-wide association studyWe performed genome-wide association study (GWAS) on 12 phenotypic traits (6 traits mentioned above and THRL under different conditions) using TASSEL 5.3.38. SNPs showing =0.05 MAF and >0.2 missing data across the 137 inbred lines were filtered from the 5,753 SNPs (see Section 2.3). Finally, we used 3,156 SNPs for general linear model (Q, GLM) and mixed linear model (Q + K, MLM) methods. Q-matrix derived from the STRUCTURE program was used for the GLM method. We performed 10,000 permutation runs to obtain the permutation-based significance in GLM analysis. The Q and kinsip (K) matrixes were used for the MLM method. K matrix was calculated based on Centered-IBS method by Tassel 5.2.38. Significant marker-trait associations (MTAs) were identified with a Benjamini-Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) at the 5% level to correct for multiple testing.3. Results and discussion3.1. Generation of 136 inbred quinoa linesAlthough quinoa is essentially self-pollinating, it does display genetic heterogeneity due to partial outcrossing due to the fact that individual plants carry both hermaphrodite and female flowers.29,30 Heterozygous alleles at a given genetic locus within an individual accession were seen in 32% of quinoa accessions examined.30 Nevertheless, to date, inbred quinoa lines have not been used in most phenotyping and genotyping studies of quinoa. Consequently, we first wished to develop inbred quinoa lines that would be a valuable resource for molecular genetics and biological studies of quinoa. We generated 136 inbred quinoa lines by self-crossing and single-seed descent of Kd,12 Iw, and all quinoa lines obtained from the USDA-GRIN quinoa germplasm collection and then named these inbred lines J lines (J001–J144, excluding J062 and J070) since one USDA accession often contains seeds with multiple distinct phenotypes in terms of colour and size and none of the J062 and J070 seeds could germinate (Supplementary Table S1). We used pollination bags to prevent cross-pollination when plants set seeds. The ratio of heterozygous sites to all SNPs sites ranged from 0.0024 to 0.019% across all lines, with an average value of 0.0075% (Supplementary Table S1, also see below), indicating that our inbred lines were purified enough for genotyping and phenotyping analyses.3.2. SNP discovery by GBSTo evaluate genetic diversity in quinoa, we used a GBS approach to identify SNPs in all inbred quinoa lines. We sequenced DNA libraries derived from EcoRI/PstI double digests of genomic DNA from our 136 quinoa inbred lines on the HiSeq2500 platform. After primary quality filtering steps, we generated a total of 560 million clean reads (covering 56.6 Gbp), with an average of 8,723,466 reads (corresponding to 880.3 Mbp) per line (Supplementary Table S1). On average, 88.0% of trimmed paired-end reads correctly mapped to the reference genome.27 The average depth for all nucleotide sites in the GBS samples was 148.1. After filtering the nucleotide sites detected by GBS for all 136 samples and by WGS for Kd, we retained 1,709,689 nucleotide sites, which correspond to 0.14% of the reference genome (Supplementary Table S4). From these 1,709,689 nucleotide sites, we detected 5,753 SNP sites, ranging from 88 (Chr13) to 719 (Chr07) per chromosome. The number of SNPs per chromosome showed a high correlation with the length of each assembled chromosome (R2 =0.93), as expected. These results suggest that the GBS reads are properly mapped to the reference sequence, since the low mis-mapping rate of GBS reads is presumably due to the high nucleotide divergence between the A and B genomes12,27 (pair-wise nucleotide divergence at synonymous site = 0.08-0.1). SNPs were distributed over the entire genome (Fig. 1). The average SNP density across all chromosomes was 0.0034 (i.e., one SNP per 297 bp) and ranged from 0.0025 (one SNP per 407 bp, Chr17) to 0.0041 (one SNP per 243 bp, Chr04) depending on the chromosome. These data indicate that the 5,753 SNPs we obtained by GBS can be used as genome-wide markers for population and phylogenetic analyses, as described below.Distribution of SNPs and nucleotide diversity in the quinoa genome.

Population structure, genetic diversity, and evolutionary history of domestication in quinoaTo investigate the population structure within C. quinoa, we conducted multiple analyses (STRUCTURE, NJ phylogenetic, and PCA) using 5,529 SNPs obtained from both GBS data for 136 lines and WGS data for 13 accessions. Assignment analysis using the program STRUCTURE indicated that the highest <U+0394>K value was observed for K = 2 (15,466) followed by K = 3 (1,490), whereas all larger Ks (K = 4) had substantially lower <U+0394>K values (Figs. 2A and B). With K = 2 (Fig. 2C), one population was mainly composed of lines from Bolivia and Peru, whereas the other population largely contained lines from Chile and a set of US accessions that lack reliable passport data (Supplementary Table S5). These two populations corresponded to those named highland and lowland (Coastal), respectively, in previous reports27,30,43,44,45 (Fig. 2D). Many of the admixed lines (lines with membership probabilities of <80%) were lowland lines (Fig. 2C). This might indicate low and/or recent gene flow had occurred from highland to lowland population. With K = 3 (Fig. 2C), the highland population was further divided into two sub-populations, corresponding to southern and northern highland sub-populations.30,43,45 The southern highland sub-population was mainly composed of lines from Bolivia, whereas the northern highland sub-population contained lines from Peru. Notably, although we identified a number of admixtures consisting of lowland and southern highland genetic background, we failed to detect any cases of admixtures between lowland and northern highland genetic material (Fig. 2C), suggesting a closer relationship between southern highland and lowland populations than between northern highland and lowland populations, as might be expected due to physical isolation (Fig. 2D). Considering that these data are consistent with previous reports,30,45,46 it would be more plausible that recent gene flow mainly occurred from the Bolivian population to the Chilean population (Fig. 2D).Population structure of 149 quinoa lines.

Red arrows indicate the estimated evolutionary process of domestication in quinoa (see Section 3 for details).We also conducted NJ analysis and PCA to examine the phylogenetic relationships among C. quinoa lines, using two C. hirucinum accessions (a wild relative of domesticated quinoa) as outliers. These two different approaches strengthen our view that quinoa lines are divided into three clusters: Lowland, northern highland, and southern highland (Figs 2D and 3; Supplementary Fig. S1). Four inbred lines (J010, J027, J032, and J040) assigned to southern highland were included in the lowland cluster of the phylogenetic NJ tree (Fig. 3), supporting the notion that the lowland cluster is more closely related to southern highland lines than it is to the northern highland cluster. One quinoa line (O654) was positioned in an intermediate position between the C. hircinum accessions BYU566 and BYU1101 in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3). In addition, line O654 had much higher heterozygosity than the other lines (0.6496 vs 0.0075% for the across-line average; Supplementary Table S2), suggesting that O654, reported in the previous study,27 may be a hybrid or a hybrid-descendant from a cross with the other species. It is noteworthy that the phylogenetic analysis placed both C. hircinum accessions BYU566 and BYU1101 at the base of all quinoa lines analysed in this study (Fig. 3). Neither C. hircinum accessions were included in the three sub-populations revealed by the PCA (Supplementary Fig. S1). These findings suggest that all quinoa lines may have originated from a single domestication event (Fig. 2D).NJ tree of 149 quinoa lines and two C. hircinum accessions based on 1.54 Mbp of sequence data corresponding to 7,586 global SNP positions.

Red asterisks indicate bootstrap values of 100%. The scale bar corresponds to 2×10-4 substitutions per nucleotide site.Next, we evaluated population differentiation using Weir and Cockerham’s Fst value. Fst between highland and lowland populations was 0.209, compared with 0.111 between northern and southern highland populations (Supplementary Table S6). These numbers indicate that highland and lowland lines are clearly differentiated, corresponding to the highest <U+0394>K (<U+0394>K = 15,466) at K = 2 obtained by STRUCTURE. For K = 3, Fst between southern highland and lowland populations (0.241) was lower than that between the northern highland and lowland populations (0.291), supporting the view that the lowland population is more closely related to the southern highland population than to the lowland population. We also estimated the genome-wide nucleotide diversity within each population: the nucleotide diversity (p) within the highland population (4.73 × 10-4 for northern highland; 4.86 × 10-4 for southern highland) was higher than across the lowland population (3.90 × 10-4) (Supplementary Table S7). While previous studies had estimated higher genetic diversity in the highland quinoa population based on limited sequence comparison30 and isozyme banding patterns,45 our genome-wide SNPs data clearly reinforce the notion that South American highland, including Lake Titicaca in the High Andes on the border between Bolivia and Peru, is the centre of diversity from which cultivated quinoa originated.Together, the results derived from our genetic analyses based on GBS and WGS data support the single domestication hypothesis:30,45,46 quinoa was most likely first domesticated near Lake Titicaca, which straddles the border between the northern and southern highland, and then spread to the northern and southern highlands, finally reaching the Chilean lowland region via the southern highland (Fig. 2D). However, a new question arises from our observations: how did the lowland population undergo high genetic differentiation relative to the southern highland population? Our findings may support the possibility that lowland quinoa populations might be derived from crosses between quinoa and wild species, such as C. hircinum, in the Chilean lowland region. In rice (Oryza sativa L.), two diversified subspecies of cultivated rice (japonica and indica) arose from a single domestication event (the japonica subspecies), and indica was later derived from crosses between japonica and wild rice species.47 However, earlier phylogenetic data obtained by WGS indicated that BYU566 clustered with the lowland population, suggesting that quinoa may have independently been domesticated in the highland and lowland.27 There are differences in both the number of quinoa lines (149 in this study vs 16 in the previous report) and in the methods (GBS + WGS vs WGS) between this study and the previous report,27 but it remains unclear whether modern-day quinoa originated from a single or two independent domestication events. Therefore, further identification of domestication-related genes such as shattering genes, and/or a genome-wide population analysis using unbiased large sample of quinoa and C. hircinum will be required to definitively determine the evolutionary process of domestication in quinoa.3.4. Phenotypic analysesDuring the plant life cycle, germination is an early and critical growth stage that determines whether plants will survive and thrive at that location. Here, we therefore focussed on salt tolerance during the germination stage as an initial evaluation of salt tolerance in quinoa lines. In total, we assessed 137 inbred quinoa lines for tolerance to high salt concentrations during germination (Supplementary Tables S8 and S9). We observed that southern highland lines had a much longer mean THRL when compared with lowland and northern highland lines after 24 h under control conditions without added NaCl (Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating that southern highland lines grew more rapidly than all other lines. This may suggest that rapid germination ability is important determinant whether plants can grow in arid regions such as Bolivian Southern Altiplano around Uyuni Salt Flats, where the frequency of rainfall occurrence is very low. However, we failed to detect significant differences in mean THRL between the three population groups after 4 days of growth in the presence of 300 mM NaCl (Supplementary Fig. S3). In contrast, we noticed that most northern highland lines did not germinate after 14 days of treatment with 600 mM NaCl, whereas lowland and southern highland lines did, suggesting that these lines are tolerant to germination under high salinity conditions (Supplementary Fig. S3). Interestingly, we saw no correlation between germination potential at 300 and 600 mM NaCl treatments (R2=0.01) (Supplementary Fig. S4). These results strongly suggest that germination tests to determine salt tolerance require high salinity conditions (600 mM NaCl) in order to differentiate quinoa lines on the basis of their salt tolerance.We also assessed 137 inbred quinoa lines for important growth traits such as TGW, PH, SD, LDW, SYP, and DF (Supplementary Tables S8 and S9). The average TGW from the southern highland and lowland lines was higher than for the northern highland lines regardless of the location and season, suggesting that northern highland lines produced smaller seeds and that TGW is a comparatively conserved trait in quinoa (Supplementary Fig. S3). For the other traits examined in this study, mean values for PH, SD, LDW, SYP, and DF were higher in the lowland lines than in the other lines (Supplementary Fig. S3), consistent with the fact that lowland accessions originated in the Chilean coastal region, which is roughly located on the same latitude as Japan conducted this study.3.5. Phenotypic diversityTo examine the relationship between population structure and phenotypic diversity, we performed a PCA using data for the phenotypic traits. The individual plotting factors for the first two PCs are listed in Supplementary Table S10. PC1 and PC2 accounted for 34.0 and 28.8% of the total phenotypic variance, respectively, and the following variables showed substantial loadings (loading coefficients =0.3): THRL (600 mM NaCl at 14 days) and TGW for PC1; four variables of plant size, namely PH, SD, LDW, and DF, for PC2. The PCA plot exhibited partially overlapping distributions for the three sub-groups (Fig. 4): PC1 separated the northern highland lines from the others, whereas PC2 separated the lines into highland and lowland lines, therefore following altitude as a discriminating factor.PCA of quinoa lines based on data for the phenotypic traits.

Scatterplot of the first two components (PC1 and PC2) from the PCA using 123 quinoa lines with complete phenotypic data. The proportion of variance explained by each component is given in parentheses along each axis. TGW, thousand-grain weight.The PCA plot and associated loading coefficients (Supplementary Table S10) clearly suggest that northern highland lines are characterized by lower salt tolerance and smaller grain size, whereas most southern highland and lowland lines are highly salt-tolerant during germination and produce larger grains (Fig. 4). In addition, most lowland lines displayed larger plant size and late flowering phenotypes, whereas southern highland lines had smaller plant size and early flowering phenotypes under our experimental conditions in Japan (Fig. 4). These data therefore demonstrate that quinoa lines should be classified into three, rather than two populations in terms of both genotype and phenotype. Notably, combining the NJ tree and the heatmap illustrating the phenotypes examined here offered a visual confirmation of the separation of quinoa lines and associated phenotypes into the three phylogenetic sub-groups indicated by the PCA (Fig. 5). Furthermore, this figure provides quick access to the genotype–phenotype state of each quinoa line (Fig. 5).Heatmap of the phenotypic traits in quinoa lines.

Therefore, the combination of genotype and phenotype data allows us to easily imagine the evolutionary history of quinoa domestication. However, since the sample size for experiments performed under strict and uniform conditions was small due to limitations of our facilities, future analyses with larger sample sizes and fewer lines are needed to confirm the results obtained here and to elucidate the mechanisms underlying salt tolerance and other key traits in quinoa. Overall, the visual data of the heatmap, combined with the phylogenetic tree, aids our understanding of the phenotypic landscape in quinoa for important growth traits (Fig. 5).3.6. Association mapping of the phenotypic traitsAlthough association mapping, which is based on the concept of LD, has been used for detecting quantitative trait loci (QTL) in a wide range of organisms, the rate of LD decay is unknown for quinoa. Therefore, before investigating the association between phenotype and genotype by GWAS, we first evaluated LD decay/extension. We calculated the pairwise r2 correlation value between SNPs with an MAF of at least 0.05. Lowland lines showed a much greater LD decay rate than highland lines (Supplementary Fig. S5). Indeed, the distance between two SNPs around which LD dropped below 0.1 was 1 Mbp for lowland lines and 5.5–8 Mbp in highland populations. Such LD decay distance was greater than in other self-pollinating crops such as rice (indica, ca. 65–75kb; japonica, ca. 150–200 kb)48,49 and sorghum (Sorghum bicolor, ca. 150 kb),50 indicating lower resolution in association mapping for identifying QTLs of quinoa.Despite this slow LD decay rate, we performed an association mapping analysis with 3,156 SNPs and 12 phenotypic traits in our quinoa population. We identified 3,091 and 4 significant MTAs (P < 0.01 for GLM, FDR <0.05 for MLM), respectively, during association mapping using the GLM and MLM methods (Supplementary Table S11 and S12). The MLM method detected far fewer MTAs than the GLM method. This discrepancy suggests that the MLM may yield fewer false-positive results than the GLM, because the MLM used the kinship as well as the population structure.51 The strong population structure and well-differentiated phenotypes among populations might underlie the much smaller number of MTAs identified by MLM. Taking into account the low LD decay rate as well as the strong population structure, these observations suggest that GWAS may not be a suitable technique for identifying QTLs in quinoa.4. Future perspectivesQuinoa has been recognized as a valued crop with the potential to contribute to global food security due to its exceptional nutritional profile and great adaptability to harsh environments. There is thus an increasing effort to expand quinoa production into non-native areas worldwide.3,19,22 To date, however, low heat tolerance, stem lodging, negative effects of long photoperiods, and high susceptibility to biotic stresses such as diseases and pests have been major limiting factors in recent quinoa expansion to areas where the pseudocereal is not adapted and for effective large-scale cultivation.52,53 Conversely, the High Andes is a major production area that provides the world with high-quality quinoa, but they are also considered to be marginal arable land (with yearly rainfall below 200-500 mm; over 3,700 m above sea level) and are in the front line of climate change. Indeed, the High Andes faces severe problems in quinoa production, mainly caused by extreme weather events induced by climate change, such as drought and frost.13 Thus, quinoa breeding is now necessary to yield maximization for potential production and yield optimization for production stability inside and outside its countries of origin.54 In this light, our current findings provide a useful basis for the molecular elucidation and genetic improvement of quinoa. One hundred and thirty-six newly developed inbred quinoa lines, which consist of three clusters grouping lines into northern highland, southern highland, and lowland sub-populations, will be powerful resources not only for quinoa breeding but also for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms underlying its great tolerance to abiotic stresses and high nutritional value. Our genotype-informed phenotypic analysis of quinoa under high salt conditions and other important growth traits will greatly contribute to the molecular dissection of traits and breeding in quinoa. We hope that our work will contribute to fill in the gap of the past 500 years in quinoa breeding and studies spanning the 16th to the 20th century, in sharp contrast to other crops that originated from the Andes, including potato, tomato, chili pepper (Capsicum annuum L.), cotton (Gossipium hirsutum L.), and tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.), which have all expanded worldwide via the Spaniards since the 16th Century.Recently, quinoa has been studied as a model plant to understand the molecular mechanisms of abiotic stress tolerance in plants. In the case of salt tolerance, the roles and functions of inorganic ions for osmotic adjustment,11 tonoplast channels,55 epidermal bladder cells,28,56–60 and xylem ion loading61 have been reported. Recently, the role of peroxisome proliferation in heat and drought stress62 and heat stress responses in quinoa shoots63 have been also demonstrated. Apart from these, other molecular analyses concerning evolution of quinoa genome,64–66 the decision to flower,67 inflorescence patterning,68 and abscisic acid (ABA)-mediated seed dormancy and germination69 have also been reported.To date, though, the quinoa research community lacks the resources of gain- and loss-of-function technologies to study gene function in situ, which constitutes a significant limiting factor for molecular analysis in quinoa. There is therefore an urgent need to develop transformation and genome editing techniques in quinoa to allow the dissection of gene function. In contrast to rice and maize (Zea mays L.), which require high fluence rates to keep plants healthy, quinoa plants grow very well in growth chambers normally used for the model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana L.), thereby enabling researchers to shift their focus from the weedy model plant Arabidopsis to the new model plant quinoa with great practical value and appropriate inbred lines. Further technical development for the study and breeding of quinoa should facilitate breeding of other staple crops based on the mechanisms of tolerance to abiotic stresses described in quinoa.Data availabilityThe raw Illumina reads used in this study are available from DDBJ/EMBL/NCBI under the accession numbers listed in Supplementary Table S1.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.We thank E.

IntroductionFor decades, DNA methylation was thought to occur only at CpG sites in mammalian cells. However, recent studies using advanced genome-wide sequencing show that non-CpG sites are also methylated in several types of mammalian cells.1–3 Methylated non-CpGs (mCpHs; H indicates A, C, or T), which are highly cell type specific1,2 and associated with the transcription of nearby genes,3 have emerged as important epigenetic markers.The mCpHs have been studied widely in pluripotent stem cells (PSCs) and brain cells4–7; they are more abundant in these cells than in other cell types8 and exhibit unique enrichment patterns, including colocalization with histone modifications,9 depletion in regulatory regions,10 and accumulation in gene-body regions and transposons.5 These patterns are highly distinct between the PSCs and brain and are potentially linked to cell type-specific functions. For example, the CAG motif tends to be methylated in PSCs, whereas the CAC motif is preferentially methylated in brain tissues.8 Methylated CACs in brain tissues are the binding target of MECP2, the mutation of which causes a neurological disorder, Rett syndrome.11 In addition, mCpH enrichment in PSCs is positively correlated with cell differentiation capacity.12The mCpHs are often positioned near methylated CpGs (mCpGs), and they show lower methylation levels.4 Because they colocalize with mCpGs, whether mCpHs alone affect cellular processes remains unclear. In mammalian cells, CpHs are methylated by de novo DNA methyltransferases DNMT3a and DNMT3b, which methylate CpGs preferentially.7,13 Because these enzymes are highly expressed in PSCs and brain cells,8 mCpHs are considered byproducts of enzyme hyperactivity.7,14,15In this study, we investigated the functional relevance of mCpHs in PSCs and brain cells. To this end, we conducted a large-scale analysis using publicly available datasets encompassing 26 whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) samples and 368 microarray samples, including DNMT-knockout samples, to elucidate the functional involvement of the enzymes. In addition, we developed a hidden Markov model (HMM) to systematically detect genomic regions in which CpG and CpH are differentially methylated, providing an opportunity to infer the functional importance of non-CpG methylation.2. Materials and methods2.1. Analysis of WGBS samplesWGBS data from human PSCs, human tissue cells (brain, lung, and spleen), and mouse ESCs (mESCs) were downloaded from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO). We found 15 datasets of 5 independent studies that assayed postnatal non-neuro-disordered brains. Among them, 14 datasets of 4 studies provided bisulfite-non conversion rates. We collected 9 datasets of 3 studies1–3 in which more than 50% of cytosines were detected (Supplementary Table S1). To our knowledge, this preparation of 9 datasets is the best effort to conduct analyses at this study with the available relevant WGBS samples in GEO (as of October 2016).After filtering out low-quality reads using the FASTX-toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit/) and duplicate reads using Samtools,16 the reads were mapped to the reference genomes (hg19 and mm10) using three bisulfite-read mappers: Bismark, 17 BSMAP, 18 and BS-seeker2.19 Then, cytosine bases in which more than five reads were aligned by at least two mappers were identified.202.2. Identification of methylated cytosine2.3. Analysis of DNA methylation microarray dataThe methylation profiles generated from Illumina HumanMethylation450 BeadChip were analyzed to reproduce the differential mCpH distribution between the human brain and PSCs. We downloaded 177 brain samples from BrainSpan (http://www.brainspan.org/) and 191 PSC samples from GSE59091.21 Among 3,091 CpH sites in the arrays, 1,079 sites had no CpGs within 100 bp (CpG-distal), and an average of 26 sites had >1 mCpG (mCpG-proximal).2.4. Designing an HMMAn empirical HMM was designed to detect the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of CpG and CpH (CpG-CpH DMRs) in each human sample. Specifically, the whole genome was segmented into 180-bp-long bins and the emission probability E for a state j at the i-th bin was calculated as follows:Ei,j=Prmini,<U+03B8>i,j ~ Binmini,<U+03B8>i,j<U+2060>,The E for bins in which the number of reads aligned at CpGs and CpHs was >10 was calculated. In addition, to ensure the continuity of the Markov model, the genomic region was divided if the continuous undetected bins were longer than 100,000 bp, and the HMM was applied separately. The probability of state transition was estimated using an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm that repeats the EM steps until the difference between the previous and current transition probabilities of all state transactions is <5e-4.22 Then, the Viterbi algorithm that finds an optimal path among the states was applied, and the bins were re-defined to P-, N-, or U-state. The consecutive bins were linked if they were in the same state and the distance between them was <3 bins (540 bp). Finally, the N-state regions were defined as CpG–CpH DMRs.2.5. Preparation of a simulated dataset2.6. Preparation of genome annotationThe annotation for hg19 was downloaded from a previous study23 including Enhancer (FANTOM5 robust enhancer),24 SuperEnhancer,25 WeakEnhancer CTCF,26 and Conserved.27 The promoter (±5,000 bp from the transcription start site), 5'-untranslated (5'-UTR), 3'-UTR, coding, CpG island (CGI), and CGI shore (±200 bp from CGI) regions were downloaded from the UCSC genome browser (https://genome.ucsc.edu/). The enhancers were obtained from a broad range of cell types and were not specific to brain tissues.2.7. Identification of hyper- and hypo-mCpH DMRsThe mCpH level for each DMR was calculated, and DMRs in which CpHs were hyper- or hypo-methylated were identified using the following criteria: >2 fold-change (FC) relative to the mCpH level in the whole genome (hyper-mCpH-DMR), and <0.5 FC relative to the mCpH level in the whole genome (hypo-mCpH-DMR). The overlap between the DMRs and the annotated genomic regions was extracted using Bedtools intersect.282.8. Analysis of transcription factor binding sitesThe transcription factors (TFs) binding to the hyper- and hypo-mCpH DMRs overlapping with transcription regulatory regions (i.e. promoter and enhancer) were analyzed. First, genomic regions in which enhancers and promoters overlapped with the hyper- or hypo-mCpH-DMRs in each sample were extracted. Then, the regions overlapped in at least two brain samples were selected for further analysis. Then the enriched TF binding sites in the regions common in at least two samples were analyzed using Homer29; the peak size was set at 200 bp (default) and repeated regions were filtered out. The input sequence was extracted from the transcribed strand for the promoter regions and from both strands for the enhancer regions. In addition, the sequences in all promoter and enhancer regions were used as background sequence. Significantly enriched binding motifs of known TFs were extracted from knownResults.txt with a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR < 0.01.2.9. Analysis of gene ontology and pathway enrichmentEnrichment of gene ontology (GO) terms (Biological Process, Molecular Function, and Cellular Component) and pathways [Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)] among genes targeted by the hyper- and hypo-mCpH-promoters and enhancers was analyzed. First, common hyper-/hypo-mCpH promoters and enhancers in 2–8 brain samples were extracted. Then, gene sets regulated by the promoter sets (derived from the different number of brain samples) were extracted from the RefSeq database (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/) and gene sets regulated by the enhancer sets were extracted from Fantom5 human enhancer track (http://slidebase.binf.ku.dk/human_enhancers/presets). Of note, the linkage between genes and enhancers was derived from their co-expression in multiple cell and tissue types captured by CAGE-seq.24 In addition, the gene sets consisting of >3,000 genes were removed. Then, the enriched GO terms and KEGG pathways were analyzed using DAVID30; the background gene set was all genes in hg19, and the terms with Benjamini–Hochberg FDR < 0.01 were selected as significantly enriched.3. Results3.1. Differential distribution of mCpGs and mCpHs in PSCs and brain cellsTo capture the genome-wide methylation status at each CpG and CpH site, human WGBS datasets were prepared from PSCs and brain cells, which contain abundant mCpHs, as well as from lung and spleen cells as controls (Supplementary Table S1). WGBS reads were analyzed using our statistical method, which integrates the outcomes from three tools; Bismark, BSMAP, and BS-seeker2. Methylation levels were quantified for up to 73% of CpGs and up to 96% of CpHs throughout the genome (Supplementary Table S1).The positional correlation between mCpHs and mCpGs was investigated. As shown in Fig. 1a and b, CpHs in PSCs were hypermethylated near mCpGs, whereas those in brain cells were hypomethylated near mCpGs. Because the position of mCpGs in the two cell types may determine the distinctive distribution of mCpHs, we focused on mCpGs present in both PSCs and brain cells and obtained consistent results (Supplementary Fig. S1a and b). In addition, a different mCpH pattern was observed at the CAC and CAG motifs (Supplementary Fig. S1c–e), which showed preferential methylation in PSCs and brain tissue, respectively.11. This suggests that the observed pattern was not caused by a positional difference of the preferentially methylated CpHs in the two cell types. To confirm the differential distribution of mCpHs, we analyzed 368 microarray-based DNA methylation datasets and compared the mCpH levels in mCpG-proximal sites (within 100 bp of mCpG) with the mCpH levels in CpG-distal sites (>100 bp away from CpG). The average CpH methylation level from the microarray data was higher than that from the sequencing data, as reported in a previous study,10 because the array includes CpHs identified as preferentially methylated in human stem cells. As shown in Fig. 1c, mCpG-proximal mCpH levels were significantly higher than CpG-distal mCpH levels in PSCs, but not in brain cells. These results indicate that mCpHs colocalize with mCpGs in PSCs, but not in brain tissue. (a) Distribution of mCpH levels around mCpGs in human PSCs.

This may reflect the nucleosome positioning that regulates the accessibility to DNMTs31 and indicates that methyltransferases move along the DNA and methylate CpGs and CpHs simultaneously, as reported previously.32,333.2. Involvement of DNMT activities in the methylation processesCpH methylation is catalyzed by DNMT3a and DNMT3b7,13,34, which are differentially expressed: DNMT3a is highly expressed in brain cells, whereas DNMT3b is preferentially expressed in PSCs.8 Therefore, we hypothesized that the mCpH distribution pattern (Fig. 1a and b) may be determined by the differential activities of DNMT3a and DNMT3b. To test this hypothesis, we first analyzed WGBS data from Dnmt1-KO (knockout) mESCs, in which DNA methylation is primarily catalyzed by Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b. As shown in Supplementary Table S1, deletion of Dnmt1 substantially decreased mCpG levels, but not mCpH levels, which is consistent with previous studies reporting the maintenance and de novo CpG methylation by Dnmt1.13 In addition, the co-localization of mCpH with mCpG was more pronounced, and mCpH levels were higher near mCpGs and decreased with increasing distance, showing clear 180 bp periodicity (Fig. 1d). This result indicates that Dnmt3a and Dnmt3b methylate CpGs and CpHs simultaneously.Next, to evaluate methylation by DNMT3a and DNMT3b separately, we used mESCs in which either Dnmt3a or Dnmt3b was re-introduced after knocking out Dnmt1, Dnmt3a, and Dnmt3b.31 Despite the low quality of the data obtained (detected number of CpGs and CpHs in Supplementary Table S1), higher mCpH levels were observed near mCpGs in both Dnmt3a- and Dnmt3b-re-introduced samples (Supplementary Fig. S2a), indicating that each of these enzymes mediates the co-localization of mCpGs and mCpHs. In addition, mCpGs and mCpHs were positively correlated in both DNMT3a- and DNMT3b-KO hESCs (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.38 and 0.32, respectively; Supplementary Fig. S2b).These results demonstrate that DNMT3a and DNMT3b can singly mediate the colocalization of mCpGs and mCpHs. This suggests that the depletion of mCpHs near mCpGs in brain cells is not caused by DNMT3a hyperactivity but rather is the result of the complex epigenetic mechanisms in the mammalian brain.3.3. Detection of differentially methylated CpGs and CpHsBecause both DNMT3a and DNMT3b generated a positive correlation between mCpH and mCpG levels at the genome-wide scale, we assumed that the negative correlation between mCpH and mCpG levels in brain tissues is highly locus specific. Such genomic regions were designated as CpG–CpH DMRs. To detect CpG–CpH DMRs, several issues must be considered. First, because average methylation levels differ dramatically between CpGs and CpHs, the methylation states at CpGs and CpHs must be evaluated in different scopes. Second, because average methylation levels also vary among cell types (Fig. 1a and b), the methylation criteria need to be adjusted for each cell type. Finally, the methylation data show positional continuity with the 180 bp periodicity, which is useful for detecting DMRs.To address these issues, we adopted an HMM approach in which the whole genome was segmented into 180 bp bins, and each bin was categorized into one of three states: P, N, and U (Fig. 2a). In P-state regions, mCpH and mCpG levels correlated positively (P). In N-state regions, the levels correlated negatively (N), namely, they were equivalent to CpG–CpH DMRs. In U-state regions, the levels were uncorrelated (U); therefore, the mCpH level remained at the average level and was not affected by the surrounding mCpG level. (a) Schematic representation of the three states in HMM. In the P state, both CpGs and CpHs are methylated or unmethylated, resulting in a positive correlation between the mCpG and mCpH levels. In the N state, either CpGs or CpHs are methylated, resulting in a negative correlation between the levels. In the U state, the levels are not correlated. The bin size was set to 180 bp because DNMT3a and DNMT3b methylate DNA strands with a ~180 bp periodicity. The N-state bins are considered CpG–CpH differentially methylated regions (CpG–CpH DMRs). (b) Schematic diagram of the state transition in the HMM. The transition probability between the states was estimated using the EM algorithm. (c) Distribution of the mC reads/total C reads at CpG sites (y-axis) and CpH sites (x-axis) aligned on each bin. The states are designated by the highest emission probability. (d) Distribution of mC reads/total C reads at CpG sites (y-axis) and CpH sites (x-axis) aligned on the P-, N-, and I-state regions designated by the Viterbi algorithm.

In the P state, both CpGs and CpHs are methylated or unmethylated, resulting in a positive correlation between the mCpG and mCpH levels.

The bin size was set to 180 bp because DNMT3a and DNMT3b methylate DNA strands with a ~180 bp periodicity. The N-state bins are considered CpG–CpH differentially methylated regions (CpG–CpH DMRs).

For visualization, (c) and (d) were drawn using chromosome 19 of sample Br-81y_1.We calculated the probability that a bin belongs to any of the three states (emission probability) and the probability of state transition modeling the positional continuity between two neighboring bins (Fig. 2b). To represent variation of mCpG and mCpH patterns among cell types, the transition probability was trained by the EM algorithm for each cell type. After training, the HMM assigned the most probable state for each bin using the Viterbi algorithm (Supplementary Fig. S3a; see Supplementary Methods). As shown in Fig. 2, the state classification of bins using the highest emission probability (Fig. 2c) and the Viterbi algorithm (Fig. 2d) demonstrated that mCpG and mCpH levels were correlated positively in the P states and negatively in the N states. After Viterbi decoding, the U states were absorbed by the P or N states, as the probability of transition from U to U is lower (Supplementary Fig. S3b).The HMM was designed to properly define the bin states by considering methylation information in and around the bin (Supplementary Fig. S3a). To confirm its performance, we generated an artificially methylated human chromosome 19 with randomly generated N states and compared precision and recall rates of the N state, defined by only emission probability or by the transition learning and Viterbi decoding (Supplementary Fig. S3c). Both precision and recall rates increased after Viterbi decoding, indicating that definition of CpG–CpH DMRs was more accurate using whole HMM workflows than using the emission probability alone.3.4. Functional analysis of brain CpG–CpH DMRsThe HMM was applied to each of the WGBS samples, and the states of all genomic regions were estimated. Approximately 20% of the genomic bins in brain samples were defined as CpG–CpH DMRs, which was a high proportion compared with that in other cell types (Fig. 3a). Moreover, the DMRs were relatively conserved among brain samples but differed from others (Supplementary Fig. S4a). In the DMRs of the brain samples, the CAC motif, followed by the other CA motifs and CTC motif, were mainly methylated, which is similar to the P-state region (Supplementary Fig. S4b).

The P values obtained with the Student’s t-test are denoted as *P < 0.01, **P < 0.001. EP, emission probability.The fraction of DMRs in a subset of known genomic elements was analyzed (Fig. 3b). The DMRs overlapped significantly with genomic regions conserved in mammals, coding regions, and enhancer regions, whereas they overlapped less with promoter, 5'-UTR, CTCF, CpG island, and CpG island shore regions. Remarkably, the enhancers marked by DMRs showed high mCpH levels, and the mCpH levels largely increased with age (Fig. 3c), indicating the potential role of mCpHs in the DMRs in brain aging.In further analysis, we collected DMRs in which CpHs were hyper- or hypo-methylated (hyper-mCpH-DMR and hypo-mCpH-DMR, respectively). Hyper-mCpH-DMRs largely overlapped with enhancer regions, whereas hypo-mCpH-DMRs overlapped with promoter and coding regions (Fig. 3d), indicating distinct mCpH density between the DMRs in distal and proximal regulatory regions. The enrichment of TF binding motifs specific for the hyper-mCpH-DMR and hypo-mCpH-DMR overlapped with the enhancer and promoter regions (hyper-mCpH enhancer, hypo-mCpH enhancer, hyper-mCpH promoter, and hypo-mCpH promoter, respectively) was analyzed. The TF binding motifs were enriched in the hyper-mCpH enhancers and the hypo-mCpH promoters, rather than the hypo-mCpH enhancers or the hyper-mCpH promoters (Supplementary Fig. S5a and b).Next, we analyzed GO and KEGG pathway enrichment of the genes regulated by the enhancers and promoters. The hyper-mCpH enhancers were involved in transcription by RNA polymerase II (GO: 0045944), immune response (GO: 000955), and MHC class II protein complex (GO: 0042613, GO: 0032395, and GO: 0002504), activating the immune response in antigen-presenting cells35 (Fig. 4a). KEGG pathways enriched in the hyper-mCpH enhancers included immune-related diseases and pathways, such as inflammatory bowel disease (hsa05321), intestinal immune network for IgA production (hsa04672), and virus infections (hsa05164 and hsa05168) (Fig. 4b). The hyper-mCpH promoters were mostly involved in DNA binding and transcription activity, and weakly associated with axon guidance (GO: 0007411) (Fig. 4c). In addition, the enriched KEGG pathways included neuroactive ligand-receptor interaction (hsa04080), although the strongest signal corresponded to cancer-related pathways (Fig. 4d). The GO terms enriched in hypo-mCpH enhancers and hypo-mCpH promoters were mostly related to DNA binding and cellular housekeeping activities (Fig. 4e and f). There was no significant KEGG term enriched in both hypo-mCpH enhancers and promoters. The enhancers, promoters, corresponding genes, and DMR status in each brain sample are described in Supplementary Tables S3–S6. Results of GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of genes regulated by the enhancers and promoters overlapped with hyper- and hypo-mCpH DMRs [hyper-mCpH enhancer (a and b), hyper-mCpH promoter (c and d), hypo-mCpH enhancer (e), and hypo-mCpH promoter (f)]. Because the hyper- and hypo-mCpH DMRs are distinct among brain samples, the promoters and enhancers overlapped with the DMRs in N samples and the corresponding gene sets (x-axis) were extracted. The GO terms and pathways (y-axis) are sorted by the sum of the -log(BH) from the gene sets, and the top 15 are shown. Only gene sets with at least one significant term or pathway are included. For example, there was no significant GO term for the enhancers overlapped with hyper-mCpH DMR in one, seven, and eight brains samples in common (a).Results of GO and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis of genes regulated by the enhancers and promoters overlapped with hyper- and hypo-mCpH DMRs [hyper-mCpH enhancer (a and b), hyper-mCpH promoter (c and d), hypo-mCpH enhancer (e), and hypo-mCpH promoter (f)].

For example, there was no significant GO term for the enhancers overlapped with hyper-mCpH DMR in one, seven, and eight brains samples in common (a).Although there was no significantly enriched GO term or pathway among genes marked by the hyper-mCpH enhancer in more than six brain samples, some of the genes were associated with neurodegeneration via the regulation of virus infection (Supplementary Table S3). For example, TANK Binding Kinase 1 (TBK1) is a key gene regulating infection by multiple viruses, such as herpes simplex virus 1 (has 05168) and Epstein-Barr virus (hsa05169), and mutations in TBK1 activate the pathology of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis36 and early-onset Alzheimer’s disease.37 The putative enhancers of the gene were marked by hyper-mCpH DMR in seven of the eight brain samples (Fig. 5a, Supplementary Table S3). On the other hand, B-cell lymphoma/leukemia 11B (BCL11B) inhibits HIV transcription by recruiting a chromatin-modifying complex,38 and its disruption may cause Huntington’s disease and Alzheimer’s disease.39 The intronic enhancer regions of this gene were also marked by hyper-mCpH DMR in most of the brain samples (Supplementary Table S3, Fig. 5b). The Integrative Genomics Viewer capture shows examples of mCpH levels in the DMRs around TBK1 (a) and BCL11B (b) in brain samples. Color indicates log-FC of the mCpH level +0.0001 (to avoid log0) against the genome-wide average. The grey regions indicate P-state, U-state, or undetected bins.The Integrative Genomics Viewer capture shows examples of mCpH levels in the DMRs around TBK1 (a) and BCL11B (b) in brain samples. Color indicates log-FC of the mCpH level +0.0001 (to avoid log0) against the genome-wide average. The grey regions indicate P-state, U-state, or undetected bins.Taken together, these observations suggest that the hypermethylation of CpHs at CpG–CpH DMRs is involved in immune responses and neuroactivity through the regulation of enhancer activity, and potentially associated with neurodegeneration.4. DiscussionThe mCpGs and mCpHs tend to colocalize in mammalian cells, casting doubt on the biological relevance of mCpHs.7,14,15 However, in this study, analysis of large-scale methylation data revealed that the patterns of these two methylation types are distinct in PSCs and brain cells. In particular, mCpHs were markedly depleted near mCpG sites in brain cells, but not in PSCs. Because our analysis of DNMT-KO samples indicated that this characteristic was not entirely attributed to the activity of DNMTs, we hypothesized that the co-methylation of CpHs with CpGs occurs in a cell type-specific manner and that these methylation processes have an unknown functional meaning.To systematically detect the DMRs of CpGs and CpHs, we designed an HMM that was successfully applied in previous studies.13,22,33 The results showed that the DMRs are remarkably abundant in brain tissue compared with other tissue types (Fig. 3a), and relatively conserved among brain samples. The CpH methylation level in the DMR with the putative enhancer region increased with brain age (Fig. 3c), indicating its potential role in brain aging. A DMR is a genomic region in which either mCpH or mCpG levels are intensified. Thus, to confirm the mCpH depletion near mCpGs, we investigated the DMRs marked by hyper- and hypomethylation of CpHs. The hypo-mCpH DMRs occupied a larger portion of the whole genome than the hyper-mCpH DMRs, and were especially enriched in the promoter and coding regions (Fig. 3d). However, the hyper-mCpH DMRs considerably overlapped with enhancer regions, and the putative target genes of these enhancers are specifically involved in the immune response, the disruption of which in the brain increases the risk of neurodegenerative disorders.40The present in-silico analyses provide evidence supporting the existence of mCpHs that are uncorrelated with mCpGs in the brain, as well as the potential functional association of mCpHs with neurodegeneration via the regulation of immune activity. However, the study had several limitations and issues that need to be solved. First, the mechanisms underlying the mutually exclusive methylation at CpGs and CpHs in the brain remain unclear. The mechanisms may involve complex DNA methylation and demethylation processes that orchestrate gene regulation, which are not completely understood.34,41 Especially, the involvement of demethylases in the formation of cell type-specific CpG-CpH methylation patterns should be addressed using additional data. Second, the corresponding transcriptome should be analyzed to investigate the effect of mCpHs on gene expression. Last, WGBS of brain samples at single-cell resolution may help elucidate the distribution and function of DMRs in detail. Thus, to better understand the roles of non-CpG methylation, future studies should incorporate genomic and epigenomic assays in various cell types along with comprehensive computational analyses.

IntroductionAllelic transmission ratio distortion (TRD) can be defined as the preferential transmission of one allele from a heterozygous parent to the offspring and consequently, the departure from the expected ratio of 0.5:0.5 under the Mendelian law of inheritance. Despite their potential implications for male fertility, both for human medicine and animal breeding, only few studies have explored TRD at a genomic level in mammals. Some of these studies are based on the genotypes of heterozygous parents and their offspring in mouse,1 pig2 and cattle,3 and have led to the identification of a few hundreds of loci displaying TRD. As TRD studies become more powerful with large families, animal models such as livestock with large pedigrees are better placed than humans to carry this research. In swine, Casellas et al.2 scanned the swine genome with 29,373 SNPs in 5 boars and their 352 offspring using a Bayesian Factor tool. The authors identified 84 SNPs that were heterozygous in at least one boar and displayed significant TRD. As TRD can be caused by defects compromising spermatogenesis, fertilizing ability or embryo development,4 TRD analysis could become an approach complementary to genome-wide association studies (GWAS) as it could help mapping genomic regions influencing reproductive performance that would, otherwise, remain undetected. However, the exploration of the potential impact on TRD caused by allelic ratio distortion (ARD) in the haploid sperm due to defects in spermatogenesis has not been explored thus far.A Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) approach to study TRD in sire to offspring designs is currently near to unfeasible due to the large number of animals that would need to be sequenced individually. The alternative of sequencing pools of gDNA from the offspring is neither a practical option because this would not allow controlling for the maternal allelic contribution. This limitation does not exist when studying ARD in sperm as the sequencing of one ejaculate allows calculating the allelic ratio in the population of haploid spermatozoa, and thus determine the existence of this ARD. In other words, each spermatozoon can be considered as a single individual carrying a haploid genome.The aim of this study was to identify variants under ARD in the ejaculate of three boars from an artificial insemination stud. We have sequenced the genomes of these boars from leukocytes (diploid cells) and ejaculated spermatozoa (haploid cells) and used the number of reads carrying each allele at heterozygous sites as proxies of the allelic frequency to estimate ARD in sperm. We hypothesize that these SNPs displaying ARD are indicating the presence of loci influencing the efficiency of spermatogenesis and that these may have an impact on sire to offspring TRD.2. Materials and methodsgDNA from blood from three boars of the Pietrain breed from different commercial boar studs were extracted with the Maxwell® RSC Whole Blood DNA Kit (Promega Biotech Ibérica SL, Alcobendas, Madrid, Spain) and treated with DNAse-free RNAse (Hoffmann-La Roche, Basel, Switzerland). Ejaculated sperm from the same animals was obtained by the hand glove method and purified as described by Gòdia et al.5 and gDNA was extracted as in Hammoud et al.6 Blood and sperm samples were collected by specialized professionals. The six WGS libraries were prepared with TruSeq DNA PCR-Free Kit (Illumina, Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) and sequenced to generate 150 bp paired end reads in an Illumina’s HiSeq X Ten System. The WGS fastq files were deposited in the NCBI Sequence Read Archive (SRA) under SRA experiment SRX7136525.Raw sequencing reads were filtered to remove adaptors and low-quality reads with Trimmomatic v.0.36.7 Filtered reads were aligned to the porcine reference genome (Sscrofa11.1) with the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) ‘mem’ v.0.7.128 and duplicate reads were removed using Picard v.2.18.7 (http://broadinstitute.github.io/picard/) MarkDuplicates. Variant calling was carried with GATK v.3.8.19 with base quality score recalibration. SNPs were discovered and filtered with standard hard filtering parameters along with a cluster filter (maximum of three variants in a cluster of 50 bp). Indels were discarded from further analysis. The resulting single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variants were then filtered for a minimum read depth of 20 and a maximum of two standard deviations from the average coverage. The predicted effect of the variants was assessed with SnpEff v.4.3T.10 Gene ontology analysis was carried with the Cytoscape v.3.6.0 plugin CluGO v.2.5.7.11  P-values were Bonferroni-corrected (q-value).2.1. Assessment of allelic ratio distortion in spermIt was applied to all the variants that were heterozygous in the blood samples for all three boars. Within each of the six sequenced samples, we used the number of reads carrying each allele to calculate the ratio based on the number of reads for a given allele divided by the total number of reads in that site. ARD was calculated in sperm (haploid) after correcting its allelic ratio by the ratio in white blood cells (diploid). The rationale behind this is that the ratio in blood should be 0.5 and any deviation from this value should be considered technical and therefore may also affect sperm (ßi <U+2260> 0). Moreover, all the heterozygous variants with a ratio below 0.4 or above 0.6 in blood were considered to be prone to technical errors and were thus removed from the analysis. We also used the results from this model to compare this ARD with the TRD in swine2.In the second approach, and in order to evaluate ARD independently within each animal, we first identified the heterozygous site in each pig in blood (again within the allele ratio 0.4–0.6) and then used the Fisher’s exact test to compare the allelic ratio between blood and sperm within each animal. Only variants in ARD in sperm above >0.6 or <0.4 were considered. To correct for multiple testing, a false discovery rate (FDR) method was employed. This was applied to: identify coding variants in common genes affected in the three boars. This was based on the hypothesis that ARD variants may not be shared in the three boars but may affect common genes with similar functional consequences. SNPs located in coding regions were extracted with BEDTools intersect v.2.17.0.12 Coding regions were extracted from the Ensembl (v96) porcine annotation. The variant effect on protein sequence was predicted with SnpEff v.4.3T.10identify ARD regions shared (less than 1 Mbp apart) in the three boars which could be indicative of a common affected regulatory element. ARD regions were determined by identifying these genomic segments containing at least three ARD SNPs with consecutive distances between SNPs below 1 Mbp within each pig. The ARD regional overlap between the three pigs was evaluated with BEDTools closest and intersect v.2.17.0.12identify ARD variants with moderate or high functional potential in genes known to be related to spermatogenesis or sperm quality in each pig regardless of whether they are shared or not in these pigs. The hypothesis here was that a large number of different genes and biological pathways may lead to ARD and thus each pig might have its own set of functions altered which may not be necessarily shared in the three boars.With the aim to assess whether our findings of ARD in sperm were the result of stochastic effects, we also employed the Fisher’s exact test, this time identifying first heterozygous sites in balanced allelic ratios (0.4–0.6) (considering sperm as the reference diploid genome) and then evaluating the allelic ratio to identify ARD in these SNPs in blood.2.2. Variant validation by Sanger sequencingWe selected 10 variants for genotype validation using PCR coupled with Sanger sequencing (Supplementary Table S1). We focused on ARD variants mapping within genes with known function on sperm biology, spermatogenesis or meiosis. Amplification reactions ranged between 1.5 or 2.5 mM dNTPs, 0.3 µM of each primer, 1.5–2.5 mM MgCl2, 30 ng of genomic DNA and 0.75 Unit of Amplitaq Gold DNA Polymerase (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Barcelona, Spain). The final volume of the reactions was 15 µl. The thermal profile included a denaturation step at 95°C for 10 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 1 min, annealing at 60°C for 1 min and extension at 72°C for 1 min, plus a final extension step at 72°C for 7 min. The specific conditions for each reaction are detailed in Supplementary Table S1. Amplicons with the expected size were purified with the ExoSAP-IT PCR Clean-up kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Barcelona, Spain) and sequenced with the BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Kit v3.1 (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) and with the forward or reverse primers listed in Supplementary Table S1. Sequencing reactions were electrophoresed in an ABI 3730 DNA analyzer (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).3. Results and discussion3.1. WGS, mapping and variant callingIn average, 458 M PE reads were obtained per sample (Supplementary Table S2). Up to 99.5% of the reads mapped to the porcine genome (Sscrofa11.1). In average, 14.2% of reads were duplicates and were thus discarded for further analysis. A genome coverage between 46 and 55x was obtained per sample (Supplementary Table S2). The average number of SNPs per sample was 10 M and 6.3 M of these passed quality control filters. From these, in average, 2.8 M SNPs were heterozygous in the blood of each animal (Supplementary Table S2). The reference allele ratio of all the heterozygous SNPs displayed very similar distribution in both blood and sperm in the three boars (Supplementary Figure S1).3.2. Analysis to detect ARD in the SNPs heterozygous in the three boarsUnder the hypothesis that ARD variants could be common in a population, we applied a Binomial model in order to take statistical advantage of analysing the three boars simultaneously. This method allowed the identification of ARD in the polymorphic sites that were heterozygous in the three boars, regardless of whether this ARD was present in one or more pigs. A total of 302,384 SNPs were heterozygous in the three samples. Fifty-five SNPs displayed statistically significant ARD using this Binomial model (Fig. 1). Manhattan plot of the allelic ratio distortion across the porcine chromosomes. The Binomial model identified 55 significant SNPs in allelic ratio distortion.Manhattan plot of the allelic ratio distortion across the porcine chromosomes. The Binomial model identified 55 significant SNPs in allelic ratio distortion.We then evaluated ARD independently within each animal by comparing the allelic events of blood and sperm using the Fisher’s exact test. Most of the 55 variants identified with the Binomial model presented ARD with the Fisher’s exact test in only one pig (Supplementary Table S3) and 17 did not display ARD in any animal with the Fisher’s exact test.These results suggest that most of the 55 variants are not the ARD causal variant or that ARD is animal-specific. As a matter of fact, this approach included only those variants that were heterozygous in the blood of the three pigs, thereby discarding a large proportion of potential candidates. One intergenic SNP presented ARD in all the three pigs (SNP_ARD_26; Supplementary Table S3).With the exclusion of 2 SNPs that located within unplaced scaffolds, 53 of the variants identified with the Binomial model, grouped into 44 regions containing 1 or more SNPs with consecutive SNP distances below 1 Mbp (Supplementary Figure S2). Thirty-seven, 5 and 2 regions contained 1, 2 and 3 SNPs, respectively (Supplementary Table S3). The previous work from Casellas et al.2 identified 84 SNPs in TRD. Of these, seven SNPs could not be liftover into the coordinates of the Sscrofa11.1 genome assembly or mapped into unplaced scaffolds. The remaining TRD SNPs were arranged by proximity in 63 regions (Supplementary Figure S2; Supplementary Table S3). Ten out of the 44 ARD regions, containing 12 ARD SNPs, were less than 2 Mbp apart from a TRD segment and 1 additional ARD region marked by 2 SNPs was just 2.08 Mbp from a TRD segment (Table 1; Supplementary Table S3). These results suggest a possible shared biological basis and also that a proportion of the TRD may be originated during spermatogenesis.

Chr: chromosome. The rsID variant is only provided for the ARD variants identified in our study.These 14 ARD SNPs were less than 100 kbp away from nine coding genes (Table 1). Two of the ARD variants (rs1111577152 and rs1113494508), located 16 bp apart to each other, mapped 54 kbp downstream from INO80D (Table 1), a INO80 Complex Subunit member of the chromatin-remodelling complex expressed in developing spermatocytes, which plays a key role in DNA damage repair as it is essential for successful meiosis and spermatogenesis in mice.13 Other ARD variants mapped within introns of genes with no reported links with spermatogenesis (Table 1).3.3. ARD coding variants in common genesAs spermatogenesis includes a set of complex processes including different stages such as proliferation and differentiation of spermatogonia, meiosis, spermiogenesis and sperm maturation, we hypothesized that ARD could be related to a wide variety of biological pathways. Under this assumption, we expected ARD variants to be rare, or at least not common, and thus not shared between the three pigs. In fact, Huang et al. already suggested that TRD variants tend to be rare because they are wiped out from the population as one allele is preferentially transmitted to the offspring over the other.4 We therefore sought to identify ARD variants independently in each pig using the Fisher’s exact test, which despite being different in the three pigs, would affect common genes or regulatory elements.The three pigs presented coding variants in ARD in two genes involved in spermatogenesis: TOP3A and UNC5B (Table 2). TOP3A is a topoisomerase that plays a relevant role in meiotic recombination, as it has been found to promote the dissolution of double Holliday junctions.14,15  UNC5B is an upstream effector of the Elmo1/Dock180 complex,16 which when disrupted in mice results in aberrant seminiferous epithelium, multinucleated giant cells, uncleared apoptotic germ cells and decreased sperm output.17 In our survey, TOP3A was affected by three ARD variants. A synonymous ARD SNP in TOP3A was shared by two boars and one of these boars also presented a missense ARD variant (Table 2). All the variants detected in TOP3A were novel whilst the variants in UNC5B were already annotated in dbSNP. However, as we do not know their allelic frequency in any population, these variants could be thus rare or uncommon. The fact that only two genes harboured ARD coding variants in the three pigs highlights the complexity and the multi-aetiological nature of ARD.

Shared ARD regions in the three boarsWe also considered the possibility that ARD variants could be rare and only present in one of the three pigs but affect common regulatory regions of relevance in spermatogenesis. We extracted the regions in each pig that contained at least three SNPs with consecutive SNP distance below 1 Mbp and then selected those that overlapped or were less than 1 Mbp apart in the three pigs. We identified four genomic regions in chromosomes 3, 7, 11 and 14 that contained a total 55 genes (Table 3; Supplementary Figure S3), several of which play a role at different stages of spermatogenesis (Table 3).

Chr: chromosome; S: sample.Gene name from orthologous genes.Some of the detected genes (VRK1, GSK3B, NID1 PALB2, ZC3H13 or NSMCE1, among others) are related to early stages of spermatogenesis (spermatogonia proliferation and meiosis). Defects in VRK1 have not only been related to spermatogonia loss and infertility in male mice18 but also to meiosis in females.19  GSK3B contributes to the induction of meiosis20 and NID1 is related to the distribution of meiotic crossover.21 Also related to recombination, PALB222 and ZC3H1323,24play a role in DNA repair during homologous recombination, whereas NSMCE1 is relevant for meiotic chromosome segregation.25,26Other genes that arise from this study (i.e. AK7, BDKRB2, ZC3H13, ARID4B or HTR2A, among others) have been associated to spermiogenesis, the process in which spermatids mature into spermatozoa in the epithelium of the seminiferous tubules and to the acquisition of sperm motility in the epididymis. This is the case, for example, of AK7, which has been linked to spermatogenic failure and male infertility probably related to defects on the tail formation.27  BDKRB2 regulates the AQP9 water channel in the murine epididymis28 and ion transport in the vas deferens of human and pig.29  ZC3H13 is a member of the m6A methyltransferase complex, which is involved in the late maturation of spermatids by regulating the expression of key genes.30  ARID4B is involved in Sertoli cell function and is linked to spermatogenic arrest at the stages of meiotic spermatocytes and post-meiotic haploid spermatids,31 whereas HTR2A has been associated to sperm count and motility, a property that is acquired by spermatozoa in the epididymis.323.5. ARD in genes related to spermatogenesis within each boarFinally, we also considered the possibility that ARD may originate from a large number of genes and processes throughout the post-meiotic stages of spermatogenesis, and thus, ARD variants may affect non-shared genes. For each boar, we extracted the ARD variants with a predicted moderate or high damaging effect on protein sequence thereby potentially altering the protein function. We identified 408 (131, 129 and 148 for sample S1, S2 and S3, respectively) ARD variants with moderate or high protein damaging effect, none of them was shared between animals and they mapped to 378 genes (Supplementary Table S4). Six of these variants showed significant ARD after correction for multiple testing (FDR = 0.05) and affected five genes (Supplementary Table S4). Four of these (ENSSSCG00000034083, ENSSSCG00000030031, ENSSSCG00000033287 and ENSSSCG00000039784) are novel genes with unknown function predicted by Ensembl Genebuild after mapping the transcripts and protein sequences from EMBL, GenBank, DDBJ, UniProtKB and RefSeq databases to the pig genome. The remaining gene, FAM120B, has been shown to play a role in adipogenesis as a transactivator of PPARG.33 Noteworthy, PPARG has been linked to sperm function and energy metabolism in pigs34 and humans35 and it has also been shown to be expressed in mouse late spermatids and primary Sertoli cells previously stimulated in vitro with lipopolysaccharide.36 Thus, it seems plausible that FAM120B modulates sperm maturation at the later stages of spermatogenesis through the regulation of PPARG.The catalogue of 378 genes was enriched for biological functions related to replication fork processing (q-value: 4.4 × 10-2), damage DNA checkpoint (q-value: 4.8 × 10-2) and filament cytoskeleton organization (q-value: 2.2 × 10-2), which all are relevant processes involved in: (i) the maintenance of genome integrity during meiosis and (ii) the formation of the sperm. Of these variants, four had a predicted high impact on TDRD15, JAM2, PCDHGA9 and AOX4. The TDRD family is associated to piwi RNA biology which is essential to keep genome stability during spermatogenesis and TDRD15 has been shown to be upregulated in mature versus immature horse testes.37 Little is known however, about the PCDHGA9 protocadherin, but protocadherins have been linked to cell adhesion and in addition, PCDHGA9 is mainly expressed in human testes.38  JAM2 has been directly linked to cell adhesion of Sertoli cells to form the blood–testis barrier and to spermatogenesis disruption.39 Finally, AOX4 has been found to be upregulated in germ cells compared with Sertoli cells during a synchronized first round of spermatogenesis.40 Of note, the alternative alleles of TDRD15 and AOX4, predicted to cause a premature stop codon on the protein sequence of these genes, were more abundant in the spermatozoa of samples S2 and S3, respectively. This phenomenon could be caused, at least, by two different scenarios. One possibility is that the reference allele, the one that is present in the reference genome assembly, is not necessarily the most frequent or the most beneficial allele in a population. Alternatively, a detrimental allele could have been hijacked by the allele from another SNP with a stronger influence on spermatogenesis in close linkage disequilibrium with the flagged SNP. The hijacking scenario is interesting but difficult to test as most likely, ARD alleles with high impact on the sequence of their host proteins would tend to be rare and thus a large population would have to be screened to identify enough animals with all the existing haplotypes and robustly measure linkage disequilibrium.A careful inspection of the 378 genes associated to ARD variants yielded a large proportion of genes whose functions are relevant for spermatogenesis. The first group of genes were involved in the formation and repair of double-strand breaks during meiosis, which result in homologous recombination. This group included well-described genes such as BRCA2,41  EME1,42  GEN1,43  HSF1,44  MEI1,45,46  RAD51B,47  RAD9B, a paralog of RAD9A, which is involved in DNA double-strand break repair during meiosis in mice,48  MSH249 and PMS2.50The second group of genes associated to ARD variants included genes related to the formation and maturation of sperm. That is the case of HRB, a gene that is essential for acrosome formation with deficient mice showing meiosis and spermiogenesis defects leading to abnormal sperm and infertility.51,52  HIPK4, which is associated to abnormal round-headed spermatozoa53 and CFAP100,54  KIF24,55  HAP154 and MARCH10,56 all linked to ciliogenesis. Other genes within this group were related to sperm maturation in the epididymis with impact on sperm motility, acrosome formation, mitochondria homeostasis or capacitation, such as KCNK17,57  PLA2G3,58  PPP3CC,59  SLC26A8,60  CCDC18961 and PINK1.62Overall, these multiple functions described by the genes linked to ARD variants are a reflex of the complexity of spermatogenesis, suggesting that ARD can arise at any moment from meiosis to sperm maturation.To the best of our knowledge, this pioneer study is the first to evaluate the potential forces of spermatogenesis that could drive TRD by evaluating ARD at the sperm level using WGS. One of the advantages of WGS over genotyping platforms is that it allows the interrogation of practically the whole genome and has thus the potential to identify the causal variants. Moreover, WGS allows querying ARD at the sperm level, which would be impossible with genotyping arrays.To validate our results, we first confirmed by PCR followed by Sanger sequencing, 10 variants identified from the different analyses we carried and selected for mapping near or for altering the protein sequence of genes with known functions on spermatogenesis (Supplementary Table S1). Two amplicons did not amplify. For the other 8 ARD variants, we confirmed all the heterozygous genotypes (Supplementary Figure S4). Moreover, one of the amplicons that did not amplify corresponded to SNP_ARD_26, the ARD variant that appeared in the Binomial model and showed ARD in all the three pigs. Thus, we could not confirm the existence of the heterozygous state in any of the three samples. We then carried an experiment using the Fisher’s exact test to assess the allelic ratio in blood when considering only the variants that were heterozygous in sperm with allelic ratios between 0.4 and 0.6. In other words, we queried ARD in blood taking sperm as the diploid reference in which ARD should not happen. As expected, the number of heterozygous sites was very similar between blood and sperm across the three boars (Fig. 2A). However, the number of SNPs showing allelic ratio deviations (ARD < 0.4 or ARD > 0.6) at P = 0.05 in blood versus the sperm reference, was one-third of the number of SNPs in ARD detected in sperm (Fig. 2B). Moreover, while the genes harbouring coding variants in ARD in sperm were enriched for pathways that are relevant for spermatogenesis and meiosis (replication fork processing, damage DNA checkpoint and filament cytoskeleton organization), the genes encompassing coding variants displaying ARD in blood were associated to pathways not related to sperm biology, such as microtubule anchoring (q-value: 0.01), maintenance of animal organ identity (q-value: 1.6 × 10-5), vitamin transport (q-value: 0.01) and cardiac muscle cell contraction (q-value: 0.02). This, together with the fact that we used stringent criteria to select the SNPs that would be subjected to the ARD study, suggests that our findings of ARD in sperm are real and have a biological basis.

(B) Number of significant SNPs in ARD (allelic ratios <0.4 or >0.6; *P < 0.05) using the Fisher’s exact test.In conclusion, our survey using WGS at 50x depth in three boars indicates the presence of ARD at the sperm level and shows that ARD can arise from multiple stages during spermatogenesis. Forthcoming studies to more deeply investigate ARD in sperm should include a larger number of boars and augmented sequencing depth. This combination would drastically increase the power to identify ARD variants and clarify the biological basis of spermatogenesis and its consequences on TRD. Moreover, the variants that we identified in this study should be tested in a larger sire : offspring pedigree to assess their allelic frequency and confirm the TRD effect. Additionally, if sufficiently frequent, these variants should be included in genetic association studies for sperm quality and male fertility to assess their potential implication on the male’s reproductive ability.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.We thank Sam Balasch (grup Gepork S.A.) for providing the blood and sperm samples.

IntroductionSince its discovery, deoxyribo nucleic acid (DNA) was popularly thought to be in canonical B-form within cells and has been attributed to influence majority of functions of DNA such as replication, transcription and repair.1  In silico analyses of eukaryotic genome have revealed the existence of non-B DNA motifs including cruciform, triplexes and G-quadruplexes.2,3Genome-wide studies revealed that G-quadruplex motifs are conserved across different eukaryotic organisms and are enriched in promoters of genes.4–6 Telomeric DNA repeats were also shown to adopt triplex and G-quadruplex structures.7–9 Z-DNA motifs have been abundantly observed in 5' ends of human genes.10 Some eukaryotic intergenic regions and 3' regions of genes have been reported to harbour cruciform-forming sequences.11 Such non-B DNA structures have been suggested to impart chromosomal fragility, leading to translocations amongst other outcomes, and eventually predisposing a cell to an oncogenic state.12–20G-quadruplexes (G4) are helical structures of stacked G-quartets, resulting in four stranded DNA structures. Guanines in the G-quartets are connected through Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding in a square planar arrangement, with extruded loops of 1–7 nucleotides.21 These loops in turn determine the parallel, antiparallel or mixed orientation. Various cations, particularly K+, influence the topology and stability of G-quadruplexes.22 Quadruplexes can be formed by one (intramolecular G4), two or four separate strands (bi-/tri-/tetra-molecular G4) of DNA (or RNA).21–23. Most G-quadruplexes follow an empirical formula G=3X G=3X G=3X G=3, where X is loop length, ranging from one to seven.24 Recent studies suggest that even the interrupted G stretches, and loops longer than seven nucleotides can be accommodated in G-quadruplex structures, if they fold into duplex hairpins.25,26 Almost all bimolecular (dimeric) G4 are formed by association of two identical sequences, whereas tetramolecular G4 may be formed by four G-rich strands associating together.24Over 375,000 putative classical G4 motifs have been reported to exist in human genome through computational analyses.3,27 In genomic context, retention of G4 motifs is observed in several functional regions and is conserved across species.28 Recent studies have demonstrated many non-conformities in G-quadruplex formation21,29–31 by virtue of GNG motifs within guanine stretches increasing the number of potential G4 motifs in vivo. G-quadruplex formation could be promoted by superhelical stress, molecular crowding32 or by specific G-quadruplex binding proteins.33Biological relevance of G4 structures is an active area of research. Maximum number of G4 structures are expected to be at the telomeric regions, given the presence of 5 to 10,000 bp of tandemly arranged T2AG3 repeats, wherein G4 structures have been suggested to play a critical role in telomere stability.34,35 G4 motifs are abundantly present in gene promoters, borders between introns and exons, and in several human DNA replication origins, indicating their potential role in gene regulation.36G-quadruplex DNA structures have been extensively studied in vitro using various biophysical techniques like nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography25,26,37 and small molecule probes.38,39 However, in vivo existence and function of G4 structures have been controversial. In an important observation, high-affinity single-chain antibodies, Sty3 (for parallel G4) and Sty49 (for antiparallel and parallel G4), were generated by ribosome display, to visualize telomeric G4 of Stylonychia lemnae macronuclei.40 These were followed up by identification of several G4 structure-specific antibodies such as HF1, BG4, hf2, and 1H6 against G4 for imaging in cells and tissues.3,41–43 Among these, BG4, a monoclonal single chain antibody generated by phage display with high affinity and specificity for G43 is being used by several groups to investigate presence of G4 structures in the genome.19,29,44,45 BG4 has been raised for a broader range of G4 structures with an impressive Kd (~2.0 nM).3 Immunostaining with BG4 in human cells showed the presence of G-quadruplex structures in all cell cycle phases, with maximum foci in S phase, which corroborates the replication-dependent formation of G4.3 Treatment of live cells with G4-intercalator pyridostatin (PDS), before immunostaining, increased the number of BG4 foci. The same group reported an impressive study where G4 ChIP-seq with BG4 led to detection of over 10,000 G4 in regulatory, nucleosome-depleted regions of human chromatin.46 Recently, a real-time detection of G4 in live cells using G4-specific fluorescent probe (SiR-PyPDS) was also shown.47 Collectively, such studies have provided insights into G4 formation in the nuclear context.Although ELISA has been used to study BG4 specificity towards G-quadruplexes previously, several aspects of its specificity are less understood. In the present study, we establish that BG4 specifically binds to both inter- and intramolecular G4 DNA, particularly when it is in parallel orientation. Double-stranded DNA did not show any BG4 binding despite the presence of G4 motif, confirming structural specificity. Also consistent with robust binding observed for G4 DNA when present in oligomeric DNA (Kd = 17.4 nM), BG4 exhibited specific binding to G4 structure, when formed in a plasmid or in genome.2.

Cells were sonicated, supernatant was collected by centrifugation at 4°C (14,000 rpm for 20 min) and loaded onto Ni-NTA column (Novagen). Column was washed in 10 mM imidazole, followed by 20 mM imidazole in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) (pH 8.0). Purified BG4 antibody was eluted using an imidazole gradient (100–1,000 mM imidazole). Fractions of interest were dialysed against dialysis buffer [25 mM Tris (pH 8.0), 100 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 2 mM DTT, 10% glycerol] after pooling the pure ones.

In order to prepare double-stranded DNA, radiolabelled oligomeric DNA (20 nM) was annealed with unlabelled complementary strand (5-fold excess) in 100 mM NaCl and 1 mM EDTA in boiling water for 10 min followed by gradual cooling as described earlier.68 For preparation of single-stranded substrates containing i-motifs, radiolabelled oligomer (20 nM) was heat denatured in 100 mM potassium acetate (pH 5.2) at 95°C for 10 min and allowed to cool down to room temperature for 2 h. These substrates were then utilized for gel mobility shift assays.2.9 Gel mobility shift assayRadiolabelled oligomers (20 nM) forming G-quadruplexes were incubated either in the presence or absence of 100 mM potassium chloride in Tris–EDTA (TE) buffer (pH 8.0) at 37°C for 1 h. In case of i-motifs, radiolabelled substrates (20 nM) were annealed either in the presence or absence of 100 mM potassium acetate (pH 5.2) at 95°C for 1 h. Reactions were incubated with BG4 or antibodies at 4°C for 1 h and the products were resolved on 6% native polyacrylamide gels containing 25 mM KCl at 100 V, at 4°C. The gels were dried, exposed to a screen, and the signal was detected using PhosphorImager Typhoon (GE, USA) as described previously.29,69For competition assays, radiolabelled oligomers (20 nM) were incubated in presence of 100 mM KCl in Tris–EDTA (TE) buffer (pH 8.0) at 37°C for 1 h, followed by incubation with BG4 (1.28 µg) at 4°C for 1 h. Increasing concentrations (0, 05, 10, 20, 40, 80, 100, 150, 200 nM) of unlabelled (cold) oligomeric DNA substrates (RT17 or DG1) were incubated simultaneously at 4°C for 1 h. Reaction products were resolved on 6% native polyacrylamide gels containing 25 mM KCl (100 V, at 4°C). The gels were dried, exposed to a screen and the signal was detected using PhosphorImager Typhoon (GE, USA).For quantification of BG4-bound complexes on native PAGE, area corresponding to the band of interest was selected from each lane. An identical box was selected in an area with no band from respective lane of the gel and was subtracted. Intensity measured in each lane was indicated as photostimulated luminescence (PSL) units (PSLU) and plotted using GraphPad Prism (ver 5.01, San Diego, CA, USA). For statistical analyses, intensities of positive control and competitor oligomer added samples have been compared by unpaired Student’s t-test. Values were considered statistically significant, if the P = 0.05.2.10 DMS protection assayRadiolabelled oligomers (RT17, KD49, KD83) were incubated in TE in presence of 100 mM KCl (37°C for 1 h), followed by incubation with BG4 (1.5 µg) at 4°C for 1 h. Dimethyl sulphate (DMS) was added to the reaction (1/200 dilution) and incubated for 15 min at room temperature as described previously.18 An equal volume of piperidine (10%) was added to each tube, and the reaction was incubated at 90°C for 30 min. Reaction was diluted to double the volume and dried under vacuum. Resultant pellet was washed thrice with water and dried under vacuum. Reaction products were resolved on an 18% denaturing polyacrylamide gel, which was further dried and the signal was detected using PhosphorImager Typhoon (GE, USA).2.11 Bio-layer interferometry (BLI)ForteBio Octet RED 96 (Forte Bio, USA) and streptavidin-coated high-precision (SAX) sensors (Forte Bio, USA) were used to study the interaction between Hif1a G4-DNA and BG4 as described earlier.48–50 PBS (1×) was used as assay buffer for BLI studies and the study was conducted at 30°C. SAX sensor tips were hydrated in buffer for 30 min prior to use. Wells in 96-microwell plates were filled with 200 µl buffer or sample as the case and agitated at 1000 rpm. Hydrated sensors were immobilized and saturated with biotinylated DNA. A reference sensor without biotinylated DNA subjected to the same protocol as the DNA-loaded sensors served as a background control. Following immobilization with biotinylated DNA, binding interaction with different concentrations of BG4 was carried out, which consisted of baseline (60 s), association (150 s), dissociation (150 s), baseline (60 s). Kd value was calculated using global curve fit (1:1) model, using Octet data analysis (v 8.0).2.12 Circular dichroism studiesG4-forming oligomers were annealed in TE in presence or absence of potassium chloride or lithium chloride (100 mM) in TE at 37°C for 1 h. For double-stranded random sequences, oligomers were annealed in TE in presence of sodium chloride (100 mM) followed by gradual cooling at room temperature. Sequences forming i-motif were annealed in presence or absence of potassium acetate (pH 5.2) (100 mM) for 10 min at 90°C and then cooled down to room temperature. Plasmids, pSXneo135, pSXneo270 and pSV4 were incubated in presence of potassium chloride (100 mM) in TE at 37°C for 1 h. All CD spectra were recorded at room temperature at wavelength range of 200–300 nm (10 cycles) for every sample, using a spectropolarimeter (JASCO J-810) at a scan speed of 50 nm/min. Separate spectrum was measured for buffer alone (15 cycles) and was subtracted from all the experimental spectra. Ellipticity was calculated using Spectra Manager and plotted as a function of wavelength.2.13 Gel mobility shift assay on plasmidsPlasmids pSXNeo135, pSXNeo270 and pSV4 were incubated in presence of 100 mM KCl in TE (37°C for 1 h), followed by BG4 (0, 1.5, 2.3, 3 µg) at 4°C for 1 h. Products were resolved on 1.2% agarose gels containing 25 mM KCl at 100 V, at room temperature. The gels were stained with ethidium bromide (0.5 µg/ml) and photographed under transilluminator (UVItec, Cambridge).2.14 ImmunoblottingFor immunoblotting analysis, ~30 µg of protein was resolved on 8–10% SDS-PAGE as described earlier.70 Briefly, following gel electrophoresis, proteins were transferred to PVDF membrane (Millipore), blocked with 5% skimmed milk powder, and probed with appropriate primary antibodies against BG4, WRN and Actin; and secondary antibodies. The blots were developed using chemiluminescent detection solution (ImmobilonTM Western, Millipore) and scanned using a gel documentation system (LAS 3000, Fuji). For quantifying the bands of interest, the area was selected in each lane, and identical rectangle was selected in an area with no band from each lane of the membrane for subtracting the background. Intensity measured in each lane was indicated as PSLU. Normalization of the protein of interest was done with loading control, ß-actin and plotted using GraphPad Prism (ver 5.01).2.15 WRN knockdown in human cellsHeLa cells (4 × 105) were transfected with shRNA cocktail against WRN using a stable cationic polymer, linear polyethylenimine (PEI) (10 µg/µl). Cells were harvested after 48 h, washed with PBS, resuspended in RIPA buffer [25 mM Tris, pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, 1% NP-40 (SRL, India), 1% sodium deoxycholate (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and 0.1% SDS] containing protease inhibitors and incubated on ice. The cell suspension was sonicated and the supernatant containing proteins were collected by centrifugation. The protein concentration was determined by Bradford method.71 Efficiency of knockdown was confirmed using immunoblotting and cells were further processed for immunofluorescence.2.16 ImmunofluorescenceHeLa cells grown on glass coverslips were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized using 0.1% Triton-X100 in PBS. Blocking was performed using 0.1% bovine serum albumin and 10% FBS. Immunofluorescence was performed using standard method with BG4, anti-FLAG (PRB-132C, Biolegend), anti-RAG1 (SC363) and anti-rabbit (62111028001 A, Millipore), followed by development using Streptavidin-FITC.72 Coverslips were mounted with DABCO/DAPI (4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole) (Invitrogen). Digital images were recorded using Zeiss Apotome and analyzed with ImageJ software. Data were analyzed and plotted with standard mean of error using GraphPad Prism (ver 5.01, GraphPad Software, Inc.).HeLa cells were seeded in presence and absence of 10% fetal bovine serum in culture medium. Cells were harvested after 48 h, processed for immunofluorescence and BG4 foci were analyzed.3. Results3.1 Purified fractions of BG4 antibody show efficient binding to single-stranded DNA containing G4 motifBG4 was overexpressed and purified using affinity column chromatography. Imidazole fractions were analyzed on a denaturing PAGE, all fractions showed enrichment for BG4 (Supplementary Fig. S1A). Among that, selected fractions (800 mM to 1 M imidazole) were pooled, dialysed and used for experiments. Identity of the protein was confirmed by western blotting (Supplementary Fig. S1B). In order to test whether the fractions collected after purification from different batches of proteins were active, purified proteins (~500 ng) were incubated with single-stranded oligomeric DNA, RT17, derived from Hif1a gene, possessing G-quadruplex motif (Supplementary Fig. S1C). Results showed specific binding of BG4 to RT17, when different batches of proteins were analyzed (Supplementary Fig. S1C, lanes 5–10 and data not shown). However, binding was absent when complementary C-rich sequence (MN89) derived from Hif1a was used (Supplementary Fig. S1C, lanes 1, 2). Thus, our results reveal that BG4 overexpressed and purified from bacteria was pure and functional.3.2 DNA substrate titrations and competition assays reveal that binding of BG4 to G4 DNA is specificTitration of BG4 with G4 containing single-stranded oligomeric DNA derived from Hif1a (RT17) and its complementary C-rich sequence (MN89) showed that the antibody binds to the G4-forming DNA from lowest concentration (150 ng) onwards (Fig. 1A, lanes 10–18). Efficiency of binding improved with increase in BG4 concentration (Fig. 1A and B). Unlike RT17, the complementary C-rich oligomer, did not show BG4 binding even at the highest concentration tested (1.3 µg) (Fig. 1A, lanes 1–9). We also observed an increase in efficiency of BG4 binding, when concentration of RT17 was increased, further confirming the preference of BG4 to G-quadruplex forming DNA (Supplementary Fig. S2).Evaluation of specificity of BG4 antibody towards G-quadruplex DNA. (A) Gel image showing BG4 binding to G4 DNA. Radiolabelled Hif1a oligomeric substrate, RT17* (lanes 10–18), was incubated in KCl at 37°C, followed by incubation with no or increasing concentrations of BG4 (0.15, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0 and 1.3 µg). Bound DNA was then electrophoresed on a 6% native PAGE and indicated using an arrow. Complementary C-rich sequence, MN89*, fails to show any binding (lanes 1–9). Asterisk represents radiolabelled substrate. (B) Bar diagram showing increase in formation of bound complex for RT17 with an increase in BG4 concentration (P < 0.05). (C) Competition assay using radiolabelled RT17, in presence of increasing concentration of unlabelled (cold) RT17, as the specific competitor. Briefly, radiolabelled RT17* was allowed to form G4 structure at 37°C, followed by incubation with BG4. Simultaneously, unlabelled RT17 (0, 05, 10, 20, 40, 80, 100, 150, 200 nM) was added to the reaction mixture, incubated and the products were resolved on a 6% native PAGE. Bound complex is indicated by an arrow.

(E) Competition assay to evaluate BG4 binding to radiolabelled RT17* in presence of cold random oligomeric DNA, DG1. Radiolabelled RT17* was allowed to form G4 at 37°C, followed by BG4 incubation. Unlabelled DG1 (0, 05, 10, 20, 40, 80, 100, 150, 200 nM) was added to reactions, and the products were resolved on a 6% native PAGE. (F) Bar diagram showing BG4 bound complex (P < 0.05), when cold random DNA substrate was added to the mixture confirming the specificity of antibody towards G4 DNA. (G, H) Gel images showing specificity of BG4. Various antibodies (200 ng) were incubated with RT17 in the same conditions as that of BG4, and the products were resolved on 6% native PAGE. Bound complex and substrate have been indicated in the gel images.Evaluation of specificity of BG4 antibody towards G-quadruplex DNA. (A) Gel image showing BG4 binding to G4 DNA. Radiolabelled Hif1a oligomeric substrate, RT17* (lanes 10–18), was incubated in KCl at 37°C, followed by incubation with no or increasing concentrations of BG4 (0.15, 0.3, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.9, 1.0 and 1.3 µg).

(C) Competition assay using radiolabelled RT17, in presence of increasing concentration of unlabelled (cold) RT17, as the specific competitor. Briefly, radiolabelled RT17* was allowed to form G4 structure at 37°C, followed by incubation with BG4.

Bound complex is indicated by an arrow. (D) Bar diagram showing reduction in bound complex when incubated with increasing concentration of unlabelled oligomer RT17 (P < 0.05), indicating specificity of antibody towards G4 DNA. (E) Competition assay to evaluate BG4 binding to radiolabelled RT17* in presence of cold random oligomeric DNA, DG1. Radiolabelled RT17* was allowed to form G4 at 37°C, followed by BG4 incubation. Unlabelled DG1 (0, 05, 10, 20, 40, 80, 100, 150, 200 nM) was added to reactions, and the products were resolved on a 6% native PAGE. (F) Bar diagram showing BG4 bound complex (P < 0.05), when cold random DNA substrate was added to the mixture confirming the specificity of antibody towards G4 DNA. (G, H) Gel images showing specificity of BG4. Various antibodies (200 ng) were incubated with RT17 in the same conditions as that of BG4, and the products were resolved on 6% native PAGE. Bound complex and substrate have been indicated in the gel images.To evaluate the specificity of antibody interaction with the substrate, competition experiments were conducted wherein fixed concentration of BG4 antibody (1.3 µg) was incubated with radiolabelled RT17 (20 nM). For competition studies, increasing concentration (5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 100, 150, 200 nM) of either unlabelled RT17 or random unlabelled oligomer, DG1 was added and incubated to the mix (Fig. 1C and E). Results showed significant reduction in BG4 binding when unlabelled RT17 was used for competition studies (Fig. 1C and D). The extent of decrease in bound complex with increasing concentrations of cold RT17 demonstrated that antibody binding is indeed specific towards G4-forming sequence (Fig. 1D). However, upon addition of random unlabelled sequence, the band formed due to RT17-BG4 bound complexes stayed unchanged (Fig. 1E and F), reiterating the fact that BG4 recognizes G4-forming motif in a highly specific manner. To further test the specificity of BG4 to G4 DNA, we incubated RT17 with various antibodies against AID, GFP, PAX5, MBP, GAPDH, and IgG (Fig. 1G and H). It was observed that none of the antibodies tested could bind to RT17, thus underlining the specificity of BG4 towards G4 motif (Fig. 1G, lanes 4–10; Fig. 1H, lanes 3–5).To quantitate BG4-binding specificity with G4 DNA, BLI experiments were performed.48–50 5'-biotinylated oligomeric DNA derived from Hif1a DNA was synthesized, immobilized to high precision streptavidin sensor surface, and allowed to interact with different concentrations (50, 80, 160, 320 nM) of BG4. Upon binding of antibody to sensors, the thickness of the sensor tip layer increases, and this difference was measured by the BLI machine as interference in wavelength shift. Sensors immobilized with 5' biotinylated DNA were transferred to wells containing assay buffer and then to the wells with both buffer and BG4 to measure interaction. Reference probe with no antibody served as background signal. Results showed a significant shift in association curve upon BG4 binding in a concentration-dependent manner (Supplementary Fig. S1D) and confirm the ability of BG4 to interact with G4 DNA. Binding curves were fit globally to a 1:1 binding model, and equilibrium dissociation constant (Kd) was calculated. Importantly, robust binding of BG4 to G4 DNA was observed with a Kd value of 17.4 ± 0.588 nM (mean ± SD), further demonstrating the BG4-binding specificity to G4 structures.3.3 BG4 binds to both inter- and intramolecular G4We have compared binding efficiency of BG4 towards different DNA substrates (Fig. 2A). Previous studies have reported that G-quadruplex structures can be either inter- or intramolecular in nature.28 We observed that oligomeric DNA derived from Hif1a (RT17) can fold into both inter- and intramolecular G-quadruplexes (Fig. 2B, lane 1).15,18,29 Incubation with increasing concentrations of BG4 revealed a concentration-dependent binding of BG4 to inter- and intramolecular G-quadruplexes (Fig. 2B, lanes 2–4) suggesting that BG4 can bind to G4 DNA when formed within a strand of DNA molecule or between different strands of DNA (Supplementary Fig. S3). However, complementary C-rich strand (MN89) of RT17, or a random sequence of comparable length, but devoid of any non-B DNA motifs (BTM6) did not show any BG4 binding (Fig. 2B, lanes 5–12). Importantly, incubation of increasing concentration of heat denatured BG4 with RT17 or of BG4 with MN89, did not show any binding (Fig. 2C, lanes 5–12).Assessment of BG4 binding to different single-stranded oligomeric DNA containing G-quadruplex motifs, random sequences.

Bound complex is indicated in the images.3.4 Mere presence of G4 motif in double-stranded DNA is not sufficient for BG4 bindingFurther, BG4 binding to oligomeric DNA containing G-quadruplex motifs was compared with that of corresponding double-stranded DNA (Fig. 3A). For this, CD studies were performed using single-stranded DNA containing G4 motif (RT17, KD16 and KD52) to ensure G4 structure formation in the DNA sequence (Fig. 3B). In contrast, an oligomeric DNA containing random sequence (AKN11/AKN18) resulted in a spectra characteristic of B-DNA (Fig. 3B). To compare BG4 binding to G4 DNA and corresponding sequence when present as double-stranded B-DNA, G4 motifs containing oligomers were annealed with their C-rich complementary sequences and used for BG4 binding assay. Results showed that unlike single-stranded DNA derived from Hif1a, c-MYC and SHOX containing G4 structures, double-stranded DNA from corresponding sequences did not show any binding to BG4 (Fig. 3C and D). These results suggest that mere presence of G-quadruplex motif on double-stranded DNA is not sufficient for BG4 binding, in all the three regions tested; rather, it requires formation of G4 structures. A random single-stranded DNA (AKN11) and duplex B-DNA (AKN11/18) were also analyzed for BG4 binding (Fig. 3C, lanes 13–16, 3 D). BG4 showed no binding to either random single-stranded DNA or B-DNA duplex, further underscoring its specificity towards G4 motifs.Assessment of BG4 binding to different single-stranded and double-stranded DNA. (A) Sequences of DNA substrates (single-stranded, double-stranded) used for binding studies. (B) CD spectra were recorded for G4-forming sequences in presence of 100 mM KCl, and for B-DNA duplex, at room temperature, within wavelength range of 220–300 nm (10 cycles), using a spectropolarimeter (JASCO J-810) at scan speed of 50 nm/min. Absorption spectrum measured for buffer alone (15 cycles) was subtracted from each sample and resulting spectra were plotted.

CD studies confirmed formation of parallel G4 DNA in case of oligomers derived from SHOX gene (KD52), C-MYC (KD16) and Hif1a (RT17). In contrast, oligomers derived from UpsB-Q-151 (SMJ37), SMJ50 (HRAS-1), SV23 (TELO), SV25 (TELO), and SV27 (TELO) showed G4 formation in antiparallel orientation (Fig. 4B). Oligomers SMJ51 (X region 1/T7 promoter), SMJ52 (C9ORF72), SMJ53 (X region 2/T7 promoter), SMJ56 (BU-1), SMJ58 (B-GLOBIN), SMJ59 (ndhA) and SMJ61 (OXY) showed G4 DNA in hybrid orientations, with prominent antiparallel peak (Fig. 4B).Evaluation of BG4 binding to different orientations of G-quadruplex DNA structures. (A) Sequences of oligomeric DNA substrates used for the study. (B) CD spectra showing G4 formation in parallel, antiparallel and hybrid orientation. DNA sequences used for studying G4 in parallel orientation were, SMJ50 (HRAS-1), KD49 (VEGF), KD51 (VEGF), KD81 (C9ORF72) and KD83 (C9ORF72). G4 structures studied in antiparallel orientation (in presence of 100 mM NaCl) were, oligomeric DNA-containing telomeric sequences SV23, SV25 and SV27. Oligomers SMJ37 (UpsB-Q-1), SMJ51 (X Reg1/T7 promoter), SMJ52 (C9ORF72), SMJ53 (X Reg2/T7 promoter), SMJ56 (BU-1), SMJ58 (B-GLOBIN), SMJ59 (ndhA), SMJ61 (OXY) showed more of hybrid G4 structures with dominant antiparallel orientation (in presence of 100 mM NaCl). For other details, refer Fig. 3B. (C) CD spectra showing i-motif formation in presence of 100 mM potassium acetate (pH 5.2), Tris buffer (pH 6.8) and Tris buffer (pH 8.8), at room temperature. Reading was taken from wavelength range of 220–320 nm (10 cycles), using a spectropolarimeter (JASCO J-810) at scan speed of 50 nm/min. Absorption spectrum measured for buffer alone (15 cycles) was subtracted from each sample and resulting spectra were plotted. In case of all the sequences (KD80, KD50, SV24, KD53, MN89), acidic pH of 5.2 promoted i-motif formation, as seen from positive peak at ~285 nm and dip at ~255 nm. (D) Comparison of BG4-binding efficiency between oligomeric DNA that can form parallel and antiparallel G-quadruplexes. Parallel G-quadruplex forming oligomers RT17 (Hif1a; lanes 8-10), KD52 (SHOX; lanes 3-5) and antiparallel G-quadruplex-forming oligomers SMJ37 (UpsB-Q-1; lanes 13-15) were incubated with increasing concentrations of BG4 (0.0, 0.4, 0.8 µg) and resolved on PAGE. In every case complementary DNA (KD53, lanes 1, 2; MN89, lanes 6, 7; SMJ36, lanes 11, 12) was used as control for BG4 binding. (E) Comparison of BG4-binding efficiency between oligomeric DNA that can form antiparallel G-quadruplexes.

(F) Assessment of BG4 binding to oligomers containing antiparallel G4 structures (SV23, lanes 3–4; SV25, lanes 7–8; SV27, lanes 9–10) and their complementary sequences (SV24, lanes 1–2; SV26, lanes 5–6; SV28, lanes 11–12). Substrates were incubated at 37°C in presence of 100 mM sodium chloride, followed by incubation with 1.5 µg of BG4 at 4°C, and the resulting complexes were resolved on a 6% native PAGE containing 100 mM NaCl.

(G) Evaluation of binding efficiency of G4 DNA derived from VEGF and C9ORF72 regions, containing GNG motifs. Oligomers were incubated at 37°C in presence of 100 mM KCl, followed by incubation with 1.0 µg of BG4 at 4°C, and products were resolved on a 6% native PAGE. (H) Comparison of BG4-binding efficiency between DNA substrates containing G4 structure, RT17 (HIF1<U+0391>; lanes 1-3) and DNA containing i-motifs, MN89 (HIF1a; lanes 4–6), KD80 (C9ORF72; lanes 7–9), KD52 (SHOX; lanes 10-12), KD50 (VEGF; lanes 13–15) and SV24 (telomeric region; lanes 16–18). RT17 was incubated at 37°C, in presence of 100 mM KCl, whereas i-motif substrates were incubated with 100 mM potassium acetate (pH 5.2) at 95°C for 2 h and cooled to room temperature.Incubation of increasing concentrations of BG4 with single-stranded substrates, KD52, RT17, SMJ37, and their respective complementary single-stranded C-rich oligomers revealed a concentration-dependent binding of BG4 to KD52 and RT17 unlike SMJ37. These results suggest that while BG4 efficiently binds to parallel G-quadruplexes but failed to do so with antiparallel structures (Fig. 4D, lanes 3–5, 8–10, 13–15). Consistent with above observations, BG4 failed to bind complementary C-rich sequences KD53, MN89, and SMJ36 (Fig. 4D, lanes 1–2, 6–7, 11–12). Further BG4 binding was also tested on oligomeric DNA that contain G4 motifs with GNG sequences KD49, KD81, KD83 and KD85 (Fig. 4A). CD studies confirmed formation of parallel G4 DNA confirmation on these oligomers (Fig. 4B). EMSA studies using BG4 antibody on these oligomers revealed that all G4 structures exhibited detectable binding to these oligomeric DNA except KD85 (Fig. 4G). Surprisingly, oligomers assuming hybrid and antiparallel orientations (SMJ50-61; Fig. 4A and B) consistently did not show any BG4 binding (Fig. 4A, B and E). Antiparallel G4 structures derived from the human telomeric regions (SV23, SV25, SV27) also did not show BG4 binding (Fig. 4A, B and F) Thus, it appears that BG4 recognizes primarily parallel G-quadruplexes and the collective observations suggest a possible preference of the antibody for parallel over antiparallel conformations.3.6 BG4 does not bind to i-motifsSince i-motif is a multi-stranded DNA structure formed by cytosines at acidic pH (intercalated motifs),52,53 we tested whether BG4 can bind to these DNA structures. We examined propensity of multiple telomeric and non-telomeric C-rich sequences to form intercalated motifs at acidic pH of 5.2 and compared these with structures assumed at pH 6.8 and 8.8 (Fig. 4A). CD analyses of these DNA revealed robust i-motif formation across all the sequences tested, at acidic pH (Fig. 4C). BG4-binding assays revealed no significant binding when DNA substrates containing i-motif structures were tested except in the case of C-strand derived from Hif1a (Fig. 4H). BG4 binding to G4 structure present in RT17 served as positive control (Fig. 4H, lanes 1–3).3.7 DMS protection assay reveal formation of G4 structures on oligomeric DNA and interference on DMS reactivity due to BG4 bindingDMS probing is generally used to determine formation of Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding within G-quadruplex structures as they cannot get methylated by DMS and hence are resistant to piperidine cleavage.18 First, formation of G4 structure was confirmed using DMS probing on an oligomeric DNA that was derived from Hif1a containing the G4 motif (RT17) by incubating in presence of KCl (Fig. 5A). Gel profile revealed DMS protection in guanine residues following incubation with KCl suggesting formation of G4 structures (Fig. 5A). Interestingly, incubation of BG4 with RT17 in KCl containing buffer, further shielded the structures from DMS reactivity and resulted in a pattern of differential protection in the guanine residues of G4 that are free of and bound by BG4 (Fig. 5A). Two other sequences, VEGF (KD49) (Fig. 5B) and C9ORF72 (KD83) (Fig. 5C) were also probed following G4 structure formation in presence of KCl. Both revealed a similar pattern of protection upon antibody binding (Fig. 5B and C). This result further suggests an interaction of the antibody with stacked G4 structure across the three plates.DMS probing of BG4-bound G-quadruplex DNA substrates. (A) DMS protection assay of RT17 (HIF1a) in presence or absence of KCl and BG4 antibody. Since G-quadruplex structure does not form in the absence of KCl on RT17, all guanines react to DMS resulting in specific bands (lane 1, guanine residues marked in grey). Addition of potassium stabilizes the G-quadruplex DNA, and those G residues are protected and indicated in brown (lane 2). BG4 binding shields the sequence from DMS leading to additional protection and footprint (lane 3, protected guanine residues are indicated in blue). RT17 was incubated at 37°C in presence of KCl, and then incubated with BG4. DMS probing was performed at 37°C on both samples, followed by piperidine cleavage and purification. The reaction products were resolved on 18% denaturing PAGE. Brown ovals indicate the guanine residues protected in presence of potassium and in the absence of BG4. Blue ovals indicate the protected residues in presence of both potassium and BG4. (B, C) DMS probing of KD49 (VEGF) and KD83 (C9ORF72) in presence of KCl and BG4 antibody.

Results showed a positive peak at 265 nm and negative trough at 240 nm when pSXneo135 and pSXneo270 plasmids were incubated in KCl suggesting the formation of parallel G4 structure (Fig. 6B), which was consistent with previous studies.54 Further, pSXneo135 or pSXneo270 was incubated with increasing concentrations (1.5, 2.3, 3 µg) of BG4 antibody and resolved on an agarose gel to evaluate BG4 binding to G4 structures (Fig. 6C). Results showed a shift in the mobility of supercoiled forms of both the plasmid DNA (pSXneo135 and pSXNeo270), when incubated with BG4 antibody (Fig. 6C and D). The open circular form, which does not have G4 structures, remained unbound by the antibody (Fig. 6C, Supplementary Fig. S4). It is also important to note that control plasmid, pSV4 (Fig. 6A), with random sequence did not exhibit such a distinct shift even at the highest antibody concentration (Fig. 6C, Supplementary Fig. S4). Interestingly, although the shift was marginal when the plasmids were electrophoresed for a period of 3 h, the mobility shift across various concentrations of BG4 was more prominent when electrophoresed for 5 h (Fig. 6D). Thus, our results suggest that BG4 is able to bind to G4 structures when present even on plasmid DNA.Evaluation of BG4 binding on a plasmid containing telomeric DNA sequences that have the ability to fold into G-quadruplexes. (A) pSXneo135(T2AG3) and pSXneo270(T2AG3) contain 0.8  and 1.6 kb long telomeric repeats [(T2AG3)n], respectively and is shown to have the ability to form G-quadruplexes.54 pSV4 contains 1.19 kb long region containing random sequence, devoid of any non-B DNA motifs. (B) CD spectra recorded for pSXneo135, pSXneo270 and pSV4 in presence and absence of 100 mM KCl, at room temperature, within wavelength range of 200–300 nm (10 cycles), using a spectropolarimeter (JASCO J-810) at a scan speed of 50 nm/min. Absorption measured for buffer alone (15 cycles) was subtracted from each sample and the resulting spectra was plotted. (C) Comparison of BG4-binding efficiency between pSXneo135 (lanes 1–4), pSXneo270 (lanes 5–8) and pSV4 (lanes 9–12) as determined by shift in mobility of supercoiled form of the plasmid, indicated using dotted box. In each case, plasmid DNA was incubated with 100 mM KCl at 37°C for 1 h, followed by BG4 (0, 1.5, 2.3, 3 µg) at 4°C for 1 h, and resolved on 1.2% agarose gel containing 25 mM KCl at 100 V, at room temperature. BG4-bound supercoiled forms of pSXneo135 shift substantially (lanes 1–4) as do those of pSXneo270 (lanes 5–8), unlike the control plasmid pSV4 (lanes 9–12), when electrophoresed for longer time periods (5 h compared to 3 h). (D) Bar diagram showing quantification of shift in the mobility of supercoiled plasmids upon addition of BG4 (0.00, 1.5, 2.3, 3 µg). Y-axis denotes the mobility shift of the supercoiled form.Evaluation of BG4 binding on a plasmid containing telomeric DNA sequences that have the ability to fold into G-quadruplexes.

(C) Comparison of BG4-binding efficiency between pSXneo135 (lanes 1–4), pSXneo270 (lanes 5–8) and pSV4 (lanes 9–12) as determined by shift in mobility of supercoiled form of the plasmid, indicated using dotted box. In each case, plasmid DNA was incubated with 100 mM KCl at 37°C for 1 h, followed by BG4 (0, 1.5, 2.3, 3 µg) at 4°C for 1 h, and resolved on 1.2% agarose gel containing 25 mM KCl at 100 V, at room temperature. BG4-bound supercoiled forms of pSXneo135 shift substantially (lanes 1–4) as do those of pSXneo270 (lanes 5–8), unlike the control plasmid pSV4 (lanes 9–12), when electrophoresed for longer time periods (5 h compared to 3 h).

Y-axis denotes the mobility shift of the supercoiled form.3.9 BG4 binding within the cells reveal that G4 structures across different human cell types are comparableFormation of endogenous G4 structures in nuclei was examined by fluorescence microscopy using BG4 antibody.19 Cell lines of different origins, REH and Nalm6 (B cells), HEK293T (human embryonic kidney epithelial cells), and HeLa (cervical cells) were incubated with BG4, which was further detected using FLAG antibody, using biotinylated anti-rabbit secondary antibody tagged with FITC. Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI.19 Visualization of cells under Apotome fluorescence microscope revealed that BG4 foci were primarily restricted to the nuclear region. The foci pattern was of distinct punctate nature (Fig. 7). Cells treated with secondary antibody (FLAG antibody followed by anti-rabbit antibody) alone, did not result in any foci formation. RAG1 is known to be expressed in pre-B cells and is localized in the nucleus. Therefore, we used anti-RAG1 antibody in Nalm6 cells as a control to check for foci formation. It was observed that the foci formation is specific to BG4,19 whereas RAG1 showed complete fluorescence throughout the nucleus (Supplementary Fig. S5). Foci were specific to BG4 antibody addition in all cell types tested (Fig. 7). In case of each cell line, ~50 cells were counted, and results showed that maximum number of foci was seen in Nalm6 cells, which was 26 foci per cell (Fig. 7B). In case of REH cells, average BG4 foci per cell were 12. Number of foci per HEK293T cell was 16, while it was 15 in case of HeLa cells (Fig. 7B). The difference in the number of foci observed in different cell lines could be due to multiple factors. Possibilities include the transcription and replication status of the cell, level of supercoiling of the genome, higher order chromatin structures, and the difference in the origin of the cell type. Although the number of foci observed can be an under-representation, our results reveal that BG4 antibody can be used in determining G4 structures within the cells, which was consistent with previous reports3,19 and they are mostly comparable among different cell types.Evaluation of BG4 foci in various cell lines to determine occurrence of G-quadruplex DNA structures within cells. (A) Evaluation of ability of BG4 binding to G4 structures within different human cell lines, REH, Nalm6, 293 T and HeLa. Cells were fixed in 2% paraformaldehyde and permeabilized with 0.1% Triton-X100, followed by blocking. Immunofluorescence was performed by incubating cells with BG4 at 4°C, followed by anti-FLAG, and anti-rabbit secondary antibody. Following streptavidin-FITC, coverslips were mounted with DABCO/DAPI and images were recorded using Zeiss Apotome, and analyzed with ImageJ. Data were analyzed and plotted as scatter plots using GraphPad Prism. BG4 was tagged with FLAG antibody and observed in FITC channel (green). Nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue).

In order to address this, HeLa cells were transfected with WRN-shRNA and the knockdown was assessed by immunoblotting after equalization of the protein (Fig. 8A and B). Scrambled shRNA treated cells served as the control. Immunofluorescence studies following incubation with BG4 antibody, as described above revealed a significantly higher number of BG4 foci per cell following knockdown of WRN in the cellular population (Fig. 8C and D). The average number of foci seen per cell was ~20 following WRN knock down, while it was only ~10 in scrambled shRNA-treated cells (Fig. 8D) suggesting presence of more number of G-quadruplexes as compared to control (Fig. 8D). This also indicates that in a cell, helicases such as WRN may play a significant role in maintaining balance of the number of G4 structures, thus ensuring proper cellular functions and maintaining genomic integrity.Modulation of G-quadruplex formation within cells following depletion of G4 resolvase, WRN in HeLa cells.

Under such conditions, we were interested in studying the formation of G4 structures within cells. HeLa cells were harvested after 48 h of serum starvation and then assessed by immunofluorescence following incubation with BG4 antibody (Fig. 9A and Supplementary Fig. S6). BG4 foci per cell in the nuclear region in presence of serum was significantly higher than that in cytoplasmic region (Fig. 9B and Supplementary Fig. 6); whereas in case of serum-starved cells, this count dropped in the nuclear region and significantly high for the cytoplasmic region (Fig. 9B and Supplementary Fig. S6). The presence of foci in the cytoplasm could be because of RNA G-quadruplexes.56,57 Higher number of foci in the nucleus of non-starved cells is understandable due to size of the genome being much greater than the RNA. The increase in cytoplasmic BG4 foci may also be attributed to increase in stress granules, which are formed upon stress induction owing to nutrition deficiency, suggesting presence of more G-quadruplexes in the cytoplasm (Fig. 9). This observation of BG4 localization in a serum-dependent manner warrants further investigation in future.Localization of BG4 binding within HeLa cells in nutrition proficient and deficient conditions. (A) Evaluation of BG4 binding to G4 structures in HeLa under nutrition proficient (presence of FBS) and deficient (absence of FBS, incubated for 48 h) conditions. Immunofluorescence was performed for BG4 as described above. BG4 foci are marked in both nuclear and cytoplasmic regions. Serum starvation of cells for 48 h, followed by BG4 staining, revealed more localization of the antibody towards the cytoplasm.

DiscussionFormation of non-canonical DNA structures that differ from Watson–Crick B-form has been investigated for past several years, albeit in more depth in in vitro conditions. Among different non-B DNA structures, G4 structures have gained significant attention due to their role in several biological processes. Although techniques like CD, NMR and X-ray crystallography have helped decipher several properties of the polymorphic G4 outside cell, its detection inside nucleus had been a challenge, given the limitations of available methods. Discovery of antibodies that can bind to G4 structures have provided a great momentum to intracellular studies associated with G-quadruplexes (Fig. 10). Particularly, the recent discovery of BG4 and its use in ChIP genome-wide sequencing, and evaluation of G-quadruplex formation in a cell-cycle dependent manner is important.3,58Model depicting BG4-binding preferences to G-quadruplex DNA structures both in vitro and in vivo. Several forms of G4 structures may exist in the chromatin context. The interaction pattern of BG4 seems to differ depending on the nature of the G4 structure. Bimolecular and unimolecular G4 molecules of parallel orientation appear to be bound by BG4 in a differential manner.Model depicting BG4-binding preferences to G-quadruplex DNA structures both in vitro and in vivo.

Bimolecular and unimolecular G4 molecules of parallel orientation appear to be bound by BG4 in a differential manner.Other antibodies and probes reported so far have been incorporated in high-throughput studies as seen in case of hf243 and PDS.47,59 hf2 was used to enrich for genomic DNA fragments containing folded G-quadruplex structures from mechanically fragmented DNA derived from MCF7 breast cancer cells.43 These were experimentally mapped in sections of sub-telomeres, gene bodies and gene regulatory sites. DNA-damaged sites (<U+03B3>H2AX foci) induced by treatment with PDS were mapped by deep sequencing.59 These identified regions were enriched for computationally predicted G-quadruplex motifs. Staining of chromosomes and DNA fibres, higher foci count in FANCJ-depleted cells was demonstrated using 1H6 recently.42In the present study, we overexpressed and purified BG4 antibody to homogeneity for further characterization. We have employed multiple biochemical and biophysical techniques to characterize BG4 binding preferences against, single-, double-stranded DNA sequences, G-quadruplexes (when present in different conformations) in the context of shorter oligomeric DNA, plasmid DNA and genome. Previously, BG4 specificity has been demonstrated primarily by ELISA, using oligomeric DNA substrates.3 We have resorted to gel mobility shift assays to demonstrate the nature of BG4 binding with oligomeric sequences. A titration of BG4 with G4 forming Hif1a substrate demonstrated a concentration-dependent increase of BG4-bound complexes. Importantly, we demonstrate that throughout the range of antibody concentrations tested, C-rich substrate remains unbound to BG4, confirming the antibody specificity towards G-rich sequences (Table 1 and Fig. 10). This holds true for random DNA substrates devoid of any non-B DNA motifs as well. DMS protection assay in presence of KCl confirmed that the G-rich DNA sequence (RT17) indeed folds into G-quadruplex structure. DMS footprinting further revealed protection towards DMS sensitivity upon incubation with BG4.Sequence of the oligomers used for the study and their propensity to fold into G-quadruplex or i-motif structuresSequence of the oligomers used for the study and their propensity to fold into G-quadruplex or i-motif structuresCompetition experiments confirmed BG4 specificity towards G4 structures. Further assessment of the interaction using BLI showed robust binding (Kd= 17.4 ± 0.588 nM). This was comparable to a previous study (Kd = 0.5–1.6 nM, and 2.0 nM for intramolecular and intermolecular DNA G-quadruplexes, respectively using ELISA).3While we observed that oligomers that can fold into parallel G-quadruplexes bound efficiently to BG4, their respective double-stranded DNA counterparts did not bind with BG4 at all, which is in agreement with the observation that BG4 does not bind to dsDNA (Fig. 3C and D and Table 1). More importantly, we report that mere presence of G4 motifs within the double-stranded DNA sequence is not sufficient for recognition by BG4. This observation holds considerable significance in vivo, as it is possible that several G4 motifs, may not be in G4 conformation at a given time, when present in the genome.Parallel, inter- and intramolecular structures show robust BG4 binding in our studies (Table 1). In a different study, it was observed that even a parallel G4 with a hairpin bulge was recognized by the BG4 antibody.29 Although previous studies suggest that BG4 may not have binding preference for any particular G4 DNA tested,3 in the panel of substrates investigated in the current study, we were unable to detect any BG4 binding to antiparallel and hybrid G-quadruplexes (Table 1). We also observed that BG4 can bind to GNG G4 structures. This finding is of interest as it suggests that the antibody could help identify structures that are not predicted by software, such as Non-B DNA Database and QGRS Mapper that use the classical empirical G4 formula.Interestingly, we observed that the G4 structures of telomeric region in plasmid context can cause a shift in plasmid mobility, when electrophoresed on an agarose gel. However, such a shift was absent when the telomeric region was replaced with a random sequence in the same plasmid backbone, suggesting that formation of G4 complexes within plasmid DNA was responsible for BG4 binding and hence the mobility shift. Interestingly, in case of the supercoiled forms, the negative supercoiling and torsional stress promotes persistence of G4 in the telomeric repeats, and this form shifted significantly in presence of increasing amounts of BG4. This is understandable as G4 DNA formation requires energy for unwinding/melting of the DNA and hence such structures cannot be present on a nicked relaxed DNA.Using cell lines derived from different lineages, we observed significant number of BG4 foci within the cells suggesting the formation of G4 DNA (Fig. 10). This was consistent with previous studies.3 Within the genome, G4 structures tend to form in conditions that cause single-strandedness in template or non-template strand. Thus, presumably, to a higher extent these would be intramolecular G4, though the occurrence of intermolecular G4 structures cannot be completely ruled out.60,61 These G4 structures act as epitopes for the antibody. In addition to the chromosomal G4 structures, RNA molecules have also been demonstrated to form G4 structures, which could additionally be potential epitopes for BG4 antibody.56,62 Helicases, a large family of ATP-dependent nucleic acid resolvases, play a critical role in G4 DNA formation and subsequent resolution within cells. Loss-of-function mutations in any distinct family of DNA resolvases are linked to various cancers and genetic disorders, thus linking G4 sequences and genome instability.63,64 It is emerging that G-quadruplex helicases play important roles in DNA replication and telomere maintenance.55,64 Knockdown of one of the helicase family members, WRN, revealed a significant increase in G4 structures, as determined from the foci counts. This observation is consistent with a recent study showing the role of WRN helicase in modulating gene expression in a discrete subpopulation of G4 DNA structures at many chromosomal sites. This population differs from that of Bloom syndrome RECQ helicase.65 Inflicting stress on cells can alter the gene expression pattern in many ways. Along these lines, serum starvation of the cells showed more localization of the antibody in the cytoplasm, which was over and above those in the nuclei, suggesting higher levels of G-quadruplexes, possibly of RNA origin, within the cytoplasm. Implications of this observation needs to be investigated further. It would be of interest to study how G-quadruplex structures regulate processes like transcription, replication, and how such antibodies could aid their presence within the cell. Additionally, it would be useful if such antibodies could be harnessed as tags for determining the existence of G4 within certain areas of interest in the genome, rendering them as probable diagnostic tools, and more ambitiously, as therapeutic agents.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.We thank S.

(Lamiaceae) is one of ~160 different species comprising the genus Ocimum.1 Known as basil, this herb is widely cultivated as an aromatic crop, but it is also grown in home gardens the world over. The diversity of O. basilicum genotypes—as manifested by a variety of unique aromas, leaf sizes and shapes, leaf and stem colors, inflorescence colors and structures, growth habits and seed morphologies2—reflects the diverse uses of this herb. It is used in traditional medicine, as an ornamental plant, and as a source of essential oils,3 but primarily as a culinary herb, by virtue of the distinctive aroma compounds that accumulate in specialized glandular trichomes.4 The most widely grown of the genotypes is sweet basil, the type of basil used in the famous Italian pesto sauce. Still, despite the importance of sweet basil as an agricultural crop, genomic studies on this species are scarce.To date, studies aimed to estimate the genome size of various genotypes of different Ocimum species on the basis of DNA content have used flow cytometry methods. Yet, these works have not produced consistent results. With the rough rule of thumb that 1 pg DNA = 0.978 Mbp,5 the calculated haplotypic (1 C) genome size of 20 O. basilicum genotypes varies from 2.04 Gbp to 2.32 Gbp.6 For the cultivar ‘Perrie’, a fresh-cut Genovese-type basil, the genome size was estimated to be 1.56 Gbp.7 For holy basil, O. sanctum sanctum L. (synonym O. tenuiflorum L.), the genome size was estimated to be 1.39 Gbp in one study7 and 350 Mbp in another.6 A start was made on addressing these differences in two studies that sequenced the genome of holy basil; in these studies, Rastogi et al.8 assembled 386 Mbp, and Upadhyay et al.9 assembled 374 Mbp. The scaffold N50 values in these two studies were 303 kbp and 27 kbp, with a total of 9,059 and 78,224 scaffolds, respectively. Similarly, there are discrepancies in the chromosome number (2n value) for basil, which varies markedly among different studies and different genotypes. For O. basilicum, for example, the chromosome numbers were found to be 48, 52, 50, 52, 56, 72 or 74.1,10–12 More recently, Carovic-Stanko et al.6 reported 2n = 48 for 20 O. basilicum genotypes and 2n = 72 for 2 O. basilicum var. purpurascens Benth genotypes. For O. sanctum, 2n has been reported to be 16, 32, 36 and 72.11,13,14 A major advance was recently achieved with the publication of a draft genome for the home garden basil cultivar ‘Genovese’ by Bornowski et al.15 They assembled 2.07 Gbp in > 17 thousand scaffolds (greater than 10 Kbp) with an N50 of ~ 1.6 Mbp.A shortage in advanced genetic material, together with the lack of a well-established and contiguous reference genome, may explain why basil breeding programs lag behind those of other crops, such as wheat, rice or tomato. This lag also hinders the development of advanced genome editing tools for basil, since it is challenging to overcome off-targeting and redundancy without a reference genome. In the project reported here, we followed-up on our previous effort16 to close the-above described research and breeding gaps. To this end, the genome of the cultivar ‘Perrie’ was sequenced on Illumina platforms and assembled using NRGENE’s DeNovoMagicTM assembler. The resulting haploid genome was found to be 2.13 Gbp in size and is currently composed of 12,212 scaffolds. The completeness of the assembly was validated using the Benchmarking Universal Single-Copy Orthologs (BUSCO) pipeline, with less than 2% of the gene-set being fragmented. To add another layer of usable information, we built—assisted by RNA-seq data—gene models for 62,067 protein-coding genes. In parallel, we conducted a homeologous-specific analysis of the biosynthesis pathway of basil aroma, which revealed a complex genomic path of both redundancy and speciation. We have thus established, and report here, a contiguous draft reference genome and annotated genes that will serve the research and agricultural communities for many years ahead.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant material and high molecular weight genomic DNA extractionFor genome sequencing and construction, multiple clones of a single sweet basil plant of the cultivar ‘Perrie’ were grown in the dark to generate etiolated leaf tissue. For high molecular weight DNA extraction, 150 mg of the etiolated leaves were harvested, frozen in liquid nitrogen, and ground with mortar and pestle, according to Healey et al.17 with some modifications. The fine powder was mixed with 1.5 ml of extraction buffer (100 mM Tris pH 7.5, 1.5 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 2% w/v CTAB, 2% w/v PVP-40, and 0.3% v/v ß-mercaptoethanol) and incubated at 60°C for 1 h with occasional shaking. The sample was centrifuged for 5 min at 5000 g at 4°C, and the pellet was discarded. To the supernatant was added an equal volume of isoamyl alcohol: chloroform (1:24 v/v), followed by gentle mixing for 5 min and centrifugation for 10 min at 5000 g at 4°C. The pellet was discarded, RNAse was added to the supernatant at a final concentration of 20 µg × ml-1, and the sample was incubated for 15 min at 37°C with occasional shaking. Then, an equal volume of isoamyl alcohol: chloroform (1:24 v/v) was added, and the sample was gently mixed for 5 min, followed by 10 min of centrifugation at 5000 g at 4°C. The supernatant was transferred to a clean tube, a half volume of 5 M NaCl was added, and the sample was mixed gently. Then, 3 volumes of ice-cold 95% (v/v) ethanol were added, and the sample was gently mixed for 2 min, followed by incubation at -20°C for 1 h. The sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 g at 4°C, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was washed with 3 ml of ice-cold 70% (v/v) ethanol. Finally, the sample was centrifuged for 10 min at 5000 g at 4°C, the ethanol was discarded, and the tube was left open for the ethanol residues to evaporate. The precipitated DNA was resuspended in 75 µl of TE buffer at 37°C. DNA quality and quantity were evaluated with a NanoDropTM spectrophotometer and a Qubit fluorometer. The size of the extracted DNA was estimated by overnight running on a 0.5% agarose gel.2.2. Preparation and sequencing of genomic librariesFive size-selected genomic DNA libraries ranging from 470 bp to 10 Kb were constructed from the extracted basil gDNA. Two shotgun paired-end (PE) libraries were constructed using DNA template fragments of a selected size of ~470 bp, without PCR amplification (PCR-free). This size was chosen to yield overlapping sequences of the paired reads from the Hiseq2500 v2 Rapid run mode as 2 × 265 bp, thereby allowing ‘stitching’ of the read-pairs up to 520 bp long reads. A PCR-free genomic library of 700-bp DNA fragments was prepared using the TruSeq DNA Sample Preparation Kit version 2 according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, https://www.illumina.com/). Three independent MP libraries with insert sizes of 2–5 Kbp, 5–7 Kbp and 8–10 Kbp were constructed with the Illumina Nextera MP Sample Preparation Kit (Illumina). The 700-bp shotgun libraries and all three MP libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq6000 instrument, using an S4 flow cell, as 2 × 150 bp reads. DNA fragments longer than 50 Kbp were used to construct a GemCode library using a Chromium instrument (10× Genomics, Pleasanton, CA https://www.10xgenomics.com/). This library was sequenced on a NovaSeq6000 instrument, using an S4 flow cell, as 2 × 150 bp reads. Construction and sequencing of PE, mate-pair (MP) and Chromium libraries were conducted at the Roy J. Carver Biotechnology Center, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.2.3. Genome assemblyThe sweet basil genome was assembled with DeNovoMAGIC software (NRGene Ltd., Ness Ziona, Israel). This assembler is based on a De Bruijn-graph, designed to optimize raw data usage to resolve the complexity arising from genome polyploidy, heterozygosity and repetitiveness. This was done by using accurate-read-based traveling in the graph, which iteratively connects consecutive phased sequences (contigs) over local repeats to generate long-phased scaffolds18–22.2.4. Genome annotations and construction of gene modelsTo assist gene annotations, we conducted TruSeq RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) of leaves (seventh and eighth leaf pairs, three biological samples), flowers (three biological samples), stems (one sample) and roots (one sample). Total RNA was extracted according to Gonda et al.23 PE RNA libraries were constructed and sequenced by Marcrogen (Seoul, South Korea, https://www.macrogen.com/en/main/index.php) using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA LT Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). The libraries were sequenced on a NovaSeq6000 S4 flowcell as 2 × 100 bp reads. To establish basil gene models, we combined data from the following platforms: Trinity,24 SNAP,25 AUGUSTUS26 and MAKER.27 The genome annotation process comprised the following five steps: (i) RepeatModeler28 was used to build a repeat database. (ii) RNA reads were de novo assembled using Trinity software to generate genome-independent gene predictions. (iii) MAKER was run using the de novo Trinity transcriptome, the protein sequences database of Salvia splendens (extracted from the NCBI database, CA_004379255.1_SspV1_protein.faa) as a Lamiaceae species reference, with the RepeatMasker option using the RepeatModeler output. (iv) Thereafter, several MAKER iterative rounds were performed. SNAP was used to generate ab initio gene prediction models, and AUGUSTUS was trained with the previous MAKER runs to generate a species model. (v) Then, a final MAKER run was performed, followed by Blast2GO29 and UNIPROT analysis to create a set of reliable protein-coding genes.2.5. Gene expression analysisRaw RNA-seq reads were filtered and cleaned using Trimmomatic30 to remove adapters and the FASTX-Toolkit for (i) trimming read-end nucleotides with quality scores <30 using fastq_quality_trimmer and (ii) removing reads with <70% base pairs with quality scores =30 using fastq_quality_filter. Reads were mapped with STAR31 against the de novo sweet basil genome scaffolds. Transcript quantification was performed using Cufflinks (v2.2) software32 combined with gene MAKER-generated annotations. Differential expression analysis was completed using the R package edgeR.332.6. Data availabilityAll sequence data from the project were deposited in NCBI under BioProject ID PRJNA660922. Genomic and RNA-seq raw reads were deposited in the NCBI short-reads archive (SRA) under accessions SRR1256899534 and SRR12569347,35 respectively. The genome assembly and gene models were deposited in the CoGe database under genome ID 59011.363. Results and discussion3.1. Genome assemblyAltogether, DNA libraries generated about 257 Gbp of short-reads data. Based on the previous estimation of the genome size of the ‘Perrie’ cultivar as 1.56 Gbp,7 the data generated represent 165× genome coverage. The short reads were initially used to build 128,921 contigs with an N50 value of ~45 Kbp (Table 1). Then, the contigs were assembled by the DeNovoMagic assembler, and the final assembly consisted of 12,212 scaffolds with a total genome size of ~2.13 Gbp, and less than 1.3% gaps (Table 1). The genome size is in good agreement with that of Bornowski et al.15 who found a genome size of 2.07 Gbp. The N50 scaffold size was approximately 19 Mbp, and the N90 scaffold size was approximately 5.8 Mbp. A small number of scaffolds (107) comprised more than 90% of the assembled genome (N90 #scaffold; Table 1). Since 2n = 48 for O. basilicum,6 the N90 #scaffold value suggests that the size of some of the scaffolds is almost that of a complete chromosome, thereby indicating the high quality of the assembly. Bornowski et al.15 reported an N50 of ~ 1.5 Mbp with > 17,000 scaffolds greater than 10 Kbp. The apparent differences may be attributed to all/any of the three following reasons: (i) in this study, we used the highly homozygous cultivar, ‘Perrie’; (ii) the coverage of 121× used in this study is almost twice the 65× used by Bornowski et al.15; and (iii) the assembler used by us has previously been shown to produce highly contiguous genomes of multiple polyploid organisms.20,37,38 Overall, the draft genome presented here provides a more contiguous version of the sweet basil genome for the use of the scientific community at large. Sequences that could not be placed within the assembly (1.1 million) have a total size of ~0.34 Gbp and an N50 value of 384 bp (Supplementary Table S1). Screening of the genome for the prevalence of repetitive elements across the scaffolds by using RepeatModeler28 showed that the basil genome consists of 76% repetitive elements. Long-terminal repeats (LTRs) were the most commonly found types (48% of the genome), and of those, copia-like and gypsy were the most prevalent (Table 2). These values are higher than those reported by Bornowski et al.15 who found 67% repetitive elements and 37% LTR elements.Statistics summary for the contigs and scaffoldsNumber of sequences in the assembly.Number of sequences composing 50% of the assembly size.Number of sequences composing 90% of the assembly size.Statistics summary for the contigs and scaffoldsNumber of sequences in the assembly.Number of sequences composing 50% of the assembly size.Number of sequences composing 90% of the assembly size.Repetitive elements in the basil genomeRepetitive elements in the basil genome3.2. Busco validationFor an independent evaluation of the quality of the assembly, we performed an analysis with the BUSCO pipeline, which is comprised of 1,440 single-copy ortholog genes.39 Of this set, 93% of the genes were found to be complete, 5.6% were missing and only 1.5% were found to be fragmented (Table 3). It was also found that 80% of the complete BUSCO genes were in a multi-copy state. Of them, 86% were duplicated (Supplementary Table S2). This result indicated that sweet basil is a tetraploid organism, a finding that supports previous estimations.6,15,40 We further used the BUSCO data to pair homeologous scaffolds that share multiple common genes (Supplementary Table S3), indicating their relatedness to different subgenomes. If not taken into consideration, the redundancy that can arise from tetraploidy can be a major obstacle in designing a genome editing study. The report of Navet and Tian41 indicated that the lack of a reference genome prevented them from evaluating off-targeting when designing gRNAs for CRISPR: Cas9 genome editing study. With the draft sweet basil genome in hand, we will be able to design guide RNAs that will knock out both homeologous genes, as well as to screen for genome-wide off-targets. The reference genome and gene models developed here will also enable us to evade exon–exon junctions when designing guide RNAs, especially if there are large introns in the target gene that harden the sequencing of the relevant genomic region.BUSCO statistics summaryBUSCO statistics summary3.3. Genome annotations and gene models constructionA total of 157.9 million RNA-seq read-pairs, accounting for about 32 Gbp, were generated (Supplementary Table S4). After the final MAKER27 run (see Materials and Methods), 74,150 constructed genes were evident. We then used Blast2GO29 and UNIPROT to account for the protein-coding genes. After proteins smaller than 50 amino acids had been filtered out, it was determined that the basil genome contains 62,067 protein-coding genes (Supplementary File S1). Of them, 10,665 genes have alternative models. These numbers are in a good agreement with the numbers of genes and high-confidence genes found by Bornowski et al.15 Here, we used ~ 10 times more RNA-seq data from all plant parts, which plausibly produced more complete and less fragmented gene models. Indeed, the analysis of the BUSCO gene-set in our genome was more complete, with less fragmented and missing genes.15,16 We also found higher percentage of duplicated genes in the set (74% vs. 56%), suggesting a better capture of homeologous genes. Finally, of the annotated genes, 55,484 proteins were assigned to at least one GO process, function or cellular component (Supplementary Fig. S1).3.4. Phylogenetic analysisWe used the known systematics of sweet basil within the plant kingdom and within the Lamiaceae family to further validate the data. To this end, we used O. basilicum’s closest relative for which the genome has been sequenced, i.e., holy basil, O. sanctum,8 and two other members of the Lamiaceae family with available published genomes, i.e. the teak tree, Tectona grandis, and scarlet sage, S. splendens.42,43 We also included in the phylogenetic tree two species belonging to the order Limiales, namely, snapdragon, Antirrhinum majus,44 and the Asiatic witchweed, Striga asiatica.45 Another 12 eudicots from nine families and two monocots were included in the analysis to provide a broader phylogenetic view. The determination of phylogenetic relationships between gene sequences was performed with the OrthoFinder interface.46  Ocimum basilicum fell into the Lamiaceae family within the Lamiales order (Fig. 1). The tree gives genomic certainty to the place of sweet basil within the plant kingdom and within the Lamiaceae. The tree confirmed that the closest species to O. basilicum is O. sanctum. To assess the similarity of the O. basilicum genes to those of O. sanctum, a sequence similarity analysis was performed using the BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) algorithm with an e-value cut-off of 10-5. The mean similarity between the proteins of sweet basil and those of holy basil was 72% amino acid identity, with a median of 80%. Another close species to sweet basil in the Ocimum genus is Ocimum americanum, whose genome is yet to be published. Various ploidy levels have been reported for that species,47 but successful crosses of O. basilicum and O. americanum for breeding purposes have been obtained.48 Although there is no genome available, there are RNA-seq data for O. americanum in the NCBI database.49 We used STAR to align the raw reads to the sweet basil genome and found a 78% overall read mapping rate and a 59% concordant pair alignment rate. The above-described validations, taken together, indicate that we are publishing a robust genome and annotations that will serve the scientific community for many purposes, such as breeding programs with inter- and intra-specific crosses, quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping, development of molecular markers, gene expression experiments and phylogenetic analyses.Phylogenetic analyses of the sweet basil genome.

Gene expression analysis using RNA sequencingAltogether, 87% of the read-pairs were uniquely mapped to the genome, and 9% were mapped to multiple loci (Table 4). The relatively high rate of mapping to multiple loci is probably due to basil tetraploidy, with fragments of homeologous genes being highly similar to each other. The overall mapping rate of all RNA-seq reads was 96% (Table 4), indicating very good continuity of the assembly. This high mapping rate in comparison to the 83% of read-pairs mapped by Bornowski et al.15 to their genome is probably a result of the higher contiguity and homozygosity of our genome. Next, we evaluated gene expression levels in the different tissues and looked for differentially expressed genes. Overall, 1,029 to 8,832 genes were differentially expressed between at least two different tissues (p-adjust < 0.001, fold change > 4) (Table 5).RNA-sequencing mapping statisticsNumbers indicate read-pairs of the PE libraries.

Phenylpropanoid volatiles biosynthesis pathway in tetraploid sweet basilEugenol, accumulated by Genovese-type basils such as ‘Perrie’, and methyl chavicol, accumulated by Thai-type basils such as ‘Cardinal’, determine the aroma, and hence the chemotype, of the cultivar. The biosynthesis pathway of these volatiles is partially known (Fig. 2), and four genes and four aroma genes have previously been characterized.50–53 Here, we analysed their prevalence in the two subgenomes and estimated the redundancy effect that could influence genome editing attempts. We used BLASTN to assign the known genes to their genomic location and to their Gene ID. The coding genes of the four enzymes, p-coumaroyl shikimate 3'-hydroxylase (CS3'H),50 eugenol synthase (EGS),51 coniferyl alcohol acetyltransferase (CAAT)52 and eugenol O-methyl-transferase (EOMT),53 were characterized for eugenol/methyl eugenol biosynthesis.Biosynthetic pathways of phenylpropanoid volatiles in basil.

BLASTN analysis indicated two scaffolds, 33 and 243, harboring one CS3'H gene, each with three exons (Supplementary Fig. S2A). These two scaffolds are considered homeologous since they share six BUSCO genes (Supplementary Table S3). Homology analysis of these genes, XLOC_034008 (in scaffold 33) and XLOC_024688 (in scaffold 234), with the previously characterized genes ObCS3'H1 and ObCS3'H2, showed that the gene in scaffold 33 is ObCS3'H1 (99.5% homology) and the gene in scaffold 234 is ObCS3'H2 (99.1% homology) (Supplementary Fig. S2B). The minor differences are probably due to the different cultivars used for the genome construction and the original ObCS3'H study.50 The encoded proteins were found to be highly identical, with only minor amino acid substitutions (Supplementary Fig. S3). The sequenced genome and the RNA-seq performed in this study enabled a gene-specific expression analysis showing that both genes were expressed in all sampled tissues, namely, leaves, flowers, stems and roots (Fig. 3A). To check for expression bias, we performed a paired Student’s t-test across all eight samples and found a bias toward ObCS3'H2 (a < 0.01); nonetheless, it seems that both homeologous genes might contribute to the CS3'H enzymatic activity in the phenylpropanoid biosynthesis pathway (Fig. 3A).

These two scaffolds share only three BUSCO genes (Supplementary Table S3), but since scaffold 3082 is very small (1 Mbp), those scaffolds were considered as homeologous. Multiple sequence alignment of these two genes, XLOC_014724 (in scaffold 162) and XLOC_031022 (in scaffold 3082), with the characterized gene ObEGS1, showed that the gene in scaffold 3082 is truncated, while the gene in scaffold 162 is 99.8% homologous with ObEGS1 (Supplementary Fig. S4B). Amino acid alignment of the encoded proteins revealed that ObEGS1 and EGS_162 are 100% identical, but EGS_3082, termed ObEGS2, is truncated (Supplementary Fig. S5), as a result of a frameshift due to a 2-bp insertion (Supplementary Fig. S4B). We utilized the sequenced genome and the RNA-seq data to perform gene-specific expression analysis and found that both ObEGS1 and the truncated ObEGS2 are expressed mainly in the leaves and the flowers (Fig. 3B). A paired Student’s t-test across all eight samples showed a bias in expression toward ObEGS1 (a < 0.01). The fact that the truncated ObEGS2 was expressed raises the question of whether this protein encodes an active enzyme. The question of whether both homeologous genes contribute to eugenol biosynthesis thus remains open for further research and discussion. We used our sequenced genome and expression data to explain the results of a recent RNAi-based functional characterization of sweet basil CAAT, which showed only an approximately 50% reduction both in gene expression and in eugenol accumulation.52 We thus investigated whether the knocked-down gene, ObCAAT1, might be redundant in the sweet basil genome, causing residual enzymatic activity. We found two genes homologous to ObCAAT1, XLOC_042295 located on scaffold 4172, which is 100% identical to ObCAAT1, and XLOC_040540 (termed ObCAAT3) located on scaffold 407, which is 97% identical to ObCAAT1 (Supplementary Fig. S6). These scaffolds are plausibly homeologous, since they share 12 BUSCO genes (Supplementary Table S3). The amino acid sequences of the two proteins suggest that they are functional, since they do not have a premature stop codon and since the critical DFGWG and HxxxD motifs54 are conserved in both proteins (Supplementary Fig. S7). Both genes were expressed in high levels in leaf and flower tissues (Fig. 3C). Although a paired t-test showed bias toward ObCAAT1 expression (a < 0.05), the expression of ObCAAT3 supported its role in coniferyl acetate biosynthesis. We speculate that the RNAi fragment designed by Dhar et al.52 was specific to ObCAAT1 but did not alter the expression of ObCAAT3, thereby causing only a partial reduction in eugenol biosynthesis. In contrast, the primers designed for qRT-PCR may not distinguish between the two transcripts. These findings demonstrate how the genome and annotations published here will help researchers to overcome similar difficulties in future studies. Two basil O-methyl transferase (OMT) genes have been characterized, EOMT (GenBank accession number AF435008) and chavicol O-methyl transferase (CVOMT; GenBank accession number AF435007). Both these genes encode proteins that are 90% identical.53 A single amino acid, serine 261 or phenylalanine 260, determines the enzyme’s role as EOMT or CVOMT, respectively. The genomic context of these two similar genes is unknown, and whether they are two alleles of the same gene, homologous genes or homeologous genes is yet to be discovered. Since ‘Perrie’ is a eugenol-type basil, we used ObEOMT as a query for BLASTN analysis against the genome. Four putative locations showed more than 90% homology with the ObEOMT gene, two on scaffold 9 and two on scaffold 407. These scaffolds are not considered homeologous, as they do not share any BUSCO gene. On scaffold 407, the putative genes are located 956 bp apart and in opposite directions (Fig. 4A). However, they are both truncated to a size of ~750 bp, while ObEOMT is 1,074 nucleotides in size. Moreover, there are several stop codons in both genes (Fig. 4A), indicating inactive proteins, if translated. On scaffold 9, the two genes (XLOC_068107 and XLOC_068808), composed of two exons each, are located in opposite directions ~8.1 Mbp apart (Fig. 4A). They are 98% homologous, but only ~92% homologous to ObEOMT and ~96% to ObCVOMT. On the amino acid level, they are 97.5% identical, ~90% identical to ObEOMT and ~96.5% identical to ObCVOMT. Although more similar to ObCVOMT, the catalytic serine 261 residue of ObEOMT is conserved in both proteins (Fig. 4B). This serine residue, which determines the nature of the OMT enzyme to catalyze methyl eugenol but not methyl chavicol biosynthesis, is coherent with the eugenol chemotype of ‘Perrie’ cultivar. Given the truncated OMT genes on scaffold 407, we conclude that only a single subgenome contributes to methyl eugenol accumulation in sweet basil. Similar findings were obtained for EGS, but whether the active ObEOMT and ObEGS are positioned on the same subgenome is yet to be determined. Moreover, since the ‘Perrie’ genome does not harbor an OMT coding gene with catalytic phenylalanine to promote methyl chavicol production, it is reasonable to conclude that ObEOMT and ObCVOMT are two alleles of the same gene(s). In our dataset, extracted from the seventh and eighth leaf-pair positions, there was no expression of ObEOMT genes, a finding that is in keeping with our prior observation that the ‘Perrie’ cultivar accumulates methyl eugenol exclusively in the first and second leaf-pair positions.55Genomic and sequence analysis of sweet basil O-methyl transferase (OMT) genes.

Concluding remarksThe draft genome of sweet basil published here illustrates the importance of a contiguous reference genome for this tetraploid plant. The high contiguity of the genome assembled here enabled us to take the initial steps toward a complete homeologous analysis. The dissection of the phenylpropanoid volatiles biosynthetic pathway into homeologous scaffolds provides essential information for future studies focusing on pathway discoveries, genome editing and molecular breeding. Such an analysis has been shown to be essential for overcoming the polyploids inherent redundancy, which is an obstacle to achieve successful gene(s) knockout in transgenic and gene-edited plants.Supplementary data are available at DNARES online.We would like to dedicate this publication to the memory of Prof. Eli Putievsky and of Ms. Doya Sa’adi for their lifetime devotion to the Unit of Aromatic and Medicinal Plants in Newe-Ya’ar.
