IntroductionRadish (Raphanus sativus L.; 2n = 18) is a member of the Brassicaceae family and is closely related to Brassica rapa and Brassica oleracea. Radish is grown as a vegetable crop around the world, and different plant organs in different shapes and sizes are consumed in various regions. For example, radish is consumed as a big long root in East Asia, small root in Europe and the USA, and immature edible seed pod in South and Southeast Asia.In recent years, many studies have been conducted on the radish genome. The whole genome sequence of radish has been determined and released by four research groups since 2014.1–4 In addition, several linkage maps have been constructed using various DNA markers such as restriction fragment length polymorphisms, amplified fragment length polymorphisms, random amplified polymorphic DNAs, simple sequence repeats (SSRs), cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences (CAPS), and single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs).5 A genetic map with 7,480 SNPs5 has been reported, in addition to a high-density linkage map with a total of 2,553 DNA markers, including SNPs, CAPS, and SSRs.2 These DNA polymorphisms and genome sequences serve as effective tools for the identification of loci and genes responsible for agronomic traits. For example, quantitative trait loci (QTLs) affecting clubroot resistance,6,Fusarium wilt resistance,7 early bolting and flowering,8–10 and root glucosinolate content11,12 have been identified. Kakizaki et al.13 conducted map-based cloning using a mutant radish accession lacking glucoraphasatin, resulting in the discovery of a novel gene responsible for the synthesis of glucoraphasatin, which is not found in other Brassica species.Studies have also revealed genome-wide DNA polymorphisms among radish accessions. SNPs at 2,880 loci among eight accessions were identified using an amplicon sequencing method.2,12 Although the exact number of loci was unknown, a large number of genome-wide SNPs and insertions/deletions (Indels) were identified among 17 accessions via genome re-sequencing using next-generation sequencing (NGS) technologies.14 Furthermore, SSR polymorphisms have been determined at 52 loci among 93 radish accessions,15 although the number of DNA markers reported in this study was remarkably lower than those reported in the two aforementioned reports. More recently, advanced NGS methods have been developed for the identification of genome-wide SNPs such as restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq),16 double-digest RAD-seq (ddRAD-Seq),17,18 multiplexed inter-simple sequence repeat sequencing (MIG-seq),19 and genotyping by random amplicon sequencing-direct (http://newsroom.toyota.co.jp/en/detail/13715116, accessed 22 February 2020). These methods enable the analysis of several samples at once and therefore are expected to be a cost-effective and time-saving approach alternative to expensive NGS approaches.Cultivated radish accessions exhibit diverse morphological and physiological characteristics, and are taxonomically categorized as distinct varieties. For example, R. sativus var. sativus L. is a small radish cultivated mainly in the Occident (Europe, USA, and Mediterranean region) and Near East; R. sativus var. hortensis Becker is distributed in East Asia including Japan, China, and Korea, and is characterized by big and long taproots; R. sativus var. caudatus Hooker & Anderson produces an edible seed pod and is commonly called rat-tailed radish; R. sativus var. oleifer Metzg or var. chinensis Gallizioli is mainly used as an oilseed radish. Wild radish (R. sativus var. raphanistroides Makino) is native to the coast of Japan and Korea. Three wild species of the genus Raphanus are known, including Raphanus raphanistrum L., Raphanus maritimus Smith, and Raphanus landra Moretti ex DC.20,21 Knowledge of genome-wide DNA polymorphisms among these varieties and species could serve as a very valuable resource for the genetics and breeding of radish and for understanding the evolution of the genus Raphanus. Information on genome-wide SNPs among cultivars belonging to these varieties is expected to significantly advance the genetics and breeding of radish.In this study, we surveyed genome-wide SNPs in a larger collection of radish accessions (more than 500 cultivated and wild accessions) collected from East Asia, South and Southeast Asia, and the Occident and Near East using the ddRAD-Seq method. In addition, genetic diversity analyses were conducted using ~2,600 SNPs without missing data (hereafter referred to as common SNPs). Based on our results, we also discuss the origin of cultivated radish and its migration from the West to East Asia.2. Materials and methods2.1. MaterialsA total of 520 accessions were surveyed in this study (Supplementary Table S1). These accessions were obtained from the Tohoku University Brassica Seed Bank (http://www.agri.tohoku.ac.jp/pbreed/Seed_Stock_DB/SeedStock-top.html) and Genebank Project of NARO, or purchased from the market. According to the taxonomic classification (species and variety) and region of cultivation, these accessions were categorized into nine groups (Table 1): (i) Japanese landraces of R. sativus; (ii) R. sativus var. raphanistroides accessions collected from the Hokuriku area of Japan; (iii) R. sativus F1 cultivars bred in Japan; (iv) R. sativus accessions collected from East Asia (China, Korea, and Taiwan); (v) R. sativus accessions collected from South and Southeast Asia; (vi) R. sativus accessions collected from the Occident and Near East; (vii) R. raphanistrum accessions; (viii) R. maritimus accessions; and (ix) accessions from an unknown area. Summary of radish (Raphanus spp.) accessions used in this studySummary of radish (Raphanus spp.) accessions used in this study2.2. Genome sequencing and SNP detectionTo evaluate SNP heterogeneity in a single accession, leaves were sampled evenly from five to eight plants of each radish accession and ground to a fine powder. Genomic DNA was extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, the Netherlands) and subjected to ddRAD-Seq analysis, as described previously.5,18 To perform ddRAD-Seq, DNA libraries of each accession were constructed using two restriction enzymes, PstI and MspI. The digested DNA fragments were ligated to adapters, and the ligated DNA samples were purified to eliminate short DNA fragments (<300 bp). The purified DNA samples were amplified by PCR using primers including index sequences.18 The resulting amplicons were pooled, and 300–900 bp DNA fragments were purified. The purified fragments were sequenced on the HiSeq2000 or HiSeq4000 (Illumina) platform to generate 93 or 101 bp paired-end reads. The data generated were submitted to the DDBJ Sequence Read Archive (DRA) database under the accession numbers DRA008624, DRA008625, DRA008636, and DRA008637. Low-quality sequences were removed, and adapters were trimmed using PRINSEQ (–trim_right 1 –trim_qual_right 10 –min_len 100 –derep) and fastx_clipper (–a AGATCGGAAGAGC –l 100 –M 10 –n) in the FASTX-Toolkit (http://hannonlab.cshl.edu/fastx_toolkit; version 0.10.1). The filtered reads were mapped onto radish scaffold sequences (RSA_r1.0)2 using Bowtie 2 (version 2.1.0)22 using the following parameters: ––minins100 ––no-mixed. The resulting sequence alignment/map (SAM) format files were converted to binary sequence alignment/map format files and subjected to SNP calling using the mpileup option of SAMtools (version 0.1.19; parameter: –Duf)23 and the view option of BCFtools (parameter: –vcg). Heterozygous genotype calls might include the SNP heterogeneity in a single accession as well as heterozygous SNP genotypes. In both cases, it was meant that two different alleles existed in the accession. Variant call format (VCF) files were filtered using VCFtools (version 0.1.11; parameters: --max-alleles 2 --min-alleles 2 --minDP 5--minQ 999-- max-missing 0.5 --remove-indels)24 and then SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) =0.01 were extracted using TASSEL ver. 5.2.50.25 After excluding accessions with a low proportion of SNP sites (<40%), common SNPs were identified among the remaining 510 accessions (Supplementary Table S1) and counted.2.3. Genetic diversity analysis using common SNP sitesCommon SNPs (i.e. SNPs without missing data in all accessions including F1 cultivars) were converted to a biallelic representation, e.g. mix base code ‘M’ to single base ‘A’ and ‘C’ and code ‘A’ to ‘A’ and ‘A’, at all sites. The converted SNPs were subjected to principal coordinate analysis (PCoA) and molecular phylogenetic analysis.Pairwise distance matrix was calculated by counting the total number of alleles identical between any two accessions using MEGA ver. 7.0.21.26 Using the obtained distance matrix, PCoA was conducted with the cmdscale function in the stats package of R ver. 3.5.0 (https://www.r-project.org). The results were presented in a chart using Microsoft Office Excel 2016 (Microsoft Corporation, Redmond, USA).Phylogenetic analysis for all accessions was conducted using the concatenated alignments of common SNP sites. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using the maximum likelihood method and Find Best DNA/Protein Model in MEGA version 7.0.21,26 with 1,000 bootstrap pseudo replicates.For construction of an outline tree, accessions were selected as evenly as possible in the original tree. In particular, accessions from ‘Kameido’, ‘Ninengo’, ‘Shigatsu’, ‘Shijunichi’, ‘Houryo’, ‘Miyashige’, ‘Shogoin’, ‘Awa Bansei’, ‘Nerima’, ‘Minowase’, and ‘Shiroagari’, which are Japanese traditional varietal groups, were included together with several major regional cultivars and several accessions from Nansei Islands (Rs2017_016, Rs2017_018, and Rs2017_201) and southwestern area of Japan, i.e. Kyushu area (Rs2017_142, Rs2017_148, and Rs2017_158).3. Results3.1. SNPs identified among 520 radish accessionsGenome sequencing of 520 radish accessions using the ddRAD-Seq method generated 56.9 Gb of data. A total of 76,598 SNPs was identified among these accessions. Of these 520 accessions, 510 accessions excluding 10 that included 8 accessions with a remarkably low proportion of SNP sites (<40%) [Rs2017_065 (Takakura), Rs2017_073 (Bansei Miura), Rs2017_081 (Mera Daikon), Rs2017_089 (Kuroba Soubutori Minowase), Rs2017_204 (Kijikashira), Rs2017_317 (Tibet Kougen Daikon), Rs2017_323 (Everest), and Rs2017_445 (PAK-10445)] (Supplementary Table S1) and two accessions of unknown origin (Rs2017_458 and Rs2017_459) were used for further analyses. Among the remaining 510 accessions, 52,559 SNPs with MAF =0.01 were identified (Supplementary Table S2). We calculated the ratio of obtained SNP sites in each accession relative to the total number of SNP sites (52,559) (Supplementary Table S3). The average value of this ratio was 80.2%, although it ranged from 44.4% to 95.4%.The 52,559 SNPs were located on 5,138 scaffolds of RSA_r1.0.2 Of these 5,138 scaffolds, 903 scaffolds containing 19,114 SNP sites (highlighted in green in Supplementary Table S2) were mapped onto the high-density R. sativus restriction site-associated DNA sequencing (Rs-RAD) genetic map constructed by Shirasawa and Kitashiba5 (Supplementary Fig. S1). The mapped SNPs were distributed on nine linkage groups (Rs1–9), with 1,285–3,054 SNPs per linkage group (Table 2). In addition, 2,624 common SNP sites were identified among 510 accessions (highlighted in yellow in Supplementary Table S4). The common SNP sites were also distributed across each linkage group, with 76–244 SNPs per linkage group (Table 2). Number of SNPs mapped onto the Rs-RAD-based genetic map5 in each of the nine linkage groups (Rs1–9)SNPs mapped on to the Rs-RAD genetic map out of the total 52,559 SNPs identified in this study.SNPs mapped on to the Rs-RAD genetic map out of 2,624 common SNPs identified in this study.Number of SNPs mapped onto the Rs-RAD-based genetic map5 in each of the nine linkage groups (Rs1–9)SNPs mapped on to the Rs-RAD genetic map out of the total 52,559 SNPs identified in this study.SNPs mapped on to the Rs-RAD genetic map out of 2,624 common SNPs identified in this study.The ratio of a single homozygous allele to the total number of common SNP sites was calculated for each accession. This ratio was 76.0% on average and varied from a maximum of 97.0% in Rs2017_266 (Ankiku 1) to a minimum of 58.1% in Rs2017_413 (Shiromaru) (Supplementary Table S3). Among the radish populations of Japan without F1 cultivars (n = 263), East Asia (n = 88), South and Southeast Asia (n = 23), and the Occident and Near East (n = 56), the ratios of homozygous allele to the total number of common SNP sites were 75.9%, 75.3%, 68.8%, and 72.6%, respectively (Supplementary Table S5).Of the 2,624 common SNP sites, 2,262 (86.2%) were detected among Japanese R. sativus accessions. SNPs of 2,034 (77.5%), 2,122 (80.9%), 2,498 (95.2%), 2,283 (87.0%), and 1,770 (67.5%) were detected among R. sativus accessions from East Asia, South and Southeast Asia, and the Occident and Near East and among R. raphanistrum and R. maritimus accessions, respectively. In addition, the Japanese population shared 5,850 sites of the total 52,559 SNP sites, without missing sites, and SNPs were identified at 5,046 sites.A survey of nucleotide substitution patterns in 510 radish accessions showed that the number of transitions (1,554) was higher than that of transversions (1,070), and the ratio of transitions to transversions was 1.45. This ratio was almost the same as that reported previously among 17 Raphanus accessions14 and similar to that reported in Brassica napus (1.39), but quite different from that reported in B. rapa (1.0).273.2. Genetic diversity analysisPCoA was conducted using the common SNP sites identified among 510 accessions. Scores indicated by the first and second components (24.3% of the cumulative variance) for each sample were plotted on a chart (Fig. 1a). Although the 510 accessions were widely scattered on the chart, they could be grouped into four populations (clades): population A (R. sativus landraces and F1 cultivars, and R. sativus var. raphanistroides accessions mainly from Japan), population B (R. sativus landraces mainly from East Asia), population C (R. sativus landraces mainly from South and Southeast Asia), and population D (R. sativus landraces mainly from the Occident and Near East as well as R. raphanistrum and R. maritimus accessions). Another PCoA of 372 Asian accessions, excluding F1 cultivars from Japan, revealed three populations (A, B, and C) (Fig. 1b) similar to those shown in Fig. 1a. PCoA of radish accessions using common SNPs. PCoA of 510 accessions (a) and 372 Asian accessions (b).PCoA of radish accessions using common SNPs. PCoA of 510 accessions (a) and 372 Asian accessions (b).Phylogenetic analyses of 510 accessions were conducted using the common SNP sites with the maximum likelihood method. The GTR+G model was determined as the best nucleotide substitution model in MEGA7. Phylogenetic tree constructed using common SNPs among all 510 accessions is shown in Supplementary Fig. S2. An outline tree was reconstructed using the SNPs of 81 accessions enclosed by rectangles as shown in Supplementary Fig. S2 (Fig. 2).The examined Raphanus accessions were divided into five clades (Supplementary Fig. S2 and Fig. 2). Clade 1 included accessions mainly categorized as population A in Fig. 1a. Clades 2 and 3 included accessions of populations B and C, respectively, shown in Fig. 1a. Clade 4 consisted of R. sativus accessions mainly from the Occident and Near East. Clade 5 included accessions of the wild species, R. raphanistrum and R. maritimus. Interestingly, clades 1 and 2 were separated from clade 3 with a high bootstrap value. Clade 2 was subdivided into two sub-clades (2-1 and 2-2). The clade 2-1 consisted of accessions mainly from south area of East Asia including Taiwanese accessions, Rs2017_312, Rs2017_313, and Rs2017_314. On the other hand, accessions of the north area including northern part of China and Korea were included in clade 2-2. Phylogenetic tree of 81 representative radish accessions constructed using the maximum likelihood method.Phylogenetic tree of 81 representative radish accessions constructed using the maximum likelihood method.Next, we examined the coverage of 2,624 common SNP sites among the 81 accessions. Of the 2,624 common SNPs, 1,790 (68.2%) were detected in the Japanese clade. When landraces from other clades were added, the coverage of SNPs increased to 75.9% (clade 1 + clade 2) and 80.2% (clade 1 + clade 2 + clade 3). Drastic increases in SNP coverage were observed in groups comprising clades 1–4 (98.1%) and clades 1–5 (99.0%). In addition, these 81 accessions shared 5,211 sites of the total SNP sites (52,559), without missing data, and SNPs at most of the sites (98.8%) were detected.4. Discussion4.1. Large number of SNPs from geographically diverse radish accessionsTo date, nucleotide polymorphisms among radish accessions have been analysed in several studies. Shen et al.28 identified 28,758 SNPs among 18 radish accessions, based on the analysis of expressed sequence tags (ESTs) available in the NCBI database of ESTs. Kim et al.14 revealed a total of 4,033,588 SNPs and Indels among 17 radish accessions using their own re-sequencing data and publicly available genome sequence information, although the number of the polymorphic sites was not reported. From the viewpoint of the number of radish accessions, Wang et al.15 reported DNA polymorphisms among 93 radish accessions using 559 EST–SSR markers. Previously, we detected 17,341 SNPs among seven accessions from Japan and one accession from Southeast Asia.2,12 In the present study, we identified SNPs in a much larger collection of radish accessions with a wide geographical distribution and diverse morphological features and end uses (phenotypic data are available in Genebank project, NARO). While 52,559 SNP sites were identified among 510 radish accessions, the total number of SNPs among 510 accessions was estimated as 21,444,072 SNPs (52,559 sites × 0.80 [average ratio of the obtained SNP sites] × 510 accessions). Thus, our study adds valuable SNP information to the databases described above, in terms of both the number of SNPs and number of accessions. We have also constructed a new URL (http://radish.kazusa.or.jp), where comprehensive SNP data will be publicly available.Previously, amplicon sequencing2 and genome re-sequencing14 approaches were used to detect genome-wide SNPs in radish. Recently, ddRAD-Seq has proven to be highly effective for the detection of genome-wide SNPs. In tomato, a large number of SNPs (19,969) were identified between two inbred lines18 and used for the construction of a genetic map. The ddRAD-Seq method has also been used to detect SNPs in other crops, such as sweet potato, sweet cherry, and ornamental cherry29–31 and to produce a high-density genetic map in radish.5 Moreover, this technique successfully detected a large number of genome-wide SNPs in several radish accessions in the present study. These data suggest that the ddRAD-Seq is one of the most effective tools for genome analysis.4.2. Genetic diversity in the genus RaphanusPCoA identified four populations (A–D; Fig. 1a) among the 510 radish accessions examined in this study. Clades 1–3 detected by phylogenetic analysis almost exactly corresponded to populations A, B, and C detected by PCoA, respectively. Accessions in clade 4 were present in population D. Therefore, according to the results of genetic analyses, R. sativus accessions were grouped into four populations. These four populations showed a strong association with their geographic distribution; (i) Japan, (ii) China and Korea, (iii) South and Southeast Asia, and (iv) the Occident and Near East. According to plant morphology and end uses, R. sativus is further categorized into several varieties, such as var. sativus, var. niger, var. caudatus, and var. hortensis.20,21 Most of the European small radishes and black radishes are categorized as R. sativus var. sativus and var. niger, respectively.20,21 In the present study, both varieties were included in population D detected by PCoA. Rat-tailed radish cultivated in South and Southeast Asia is categorized as R. sativus var. caudatus,20,21 and most of the accessions belonging to var. caudatus were included in population C. Most of the big radishes including thick taproot, large taproot, long taproot, and round taproot found in East Asia and Japan were categorized as R. sativus var. hortensis. Most accessions of R. sativus var. hortensis used in this study were included in either population A or population B. Thus, genetic diversity in radish accessions showed a strong relationship with the variety and geographical distribution.4.3. Origin and migration of cultivated radishAmong the five clades detected by phylogenetic analysis, four clades comprised cultivated radish accessions, while one clade comprised wild radish species such as R. raphanistrum and R. maritimus. In addition, cultivated radish was separated from the wild species (Fig. 2). A similar result was reported by Wang et al.15 in a study on 93 radish accessions and 50 SSR markers. Although the number of samples examined by Shen et al.28 and Kim et al.14 was limited (<22 samples), phylogenetic analysis in these studies also showed similar divergence of cultivated radish from wild species. These results suggest that cultivated radish species were derived either from one of the wild Raphanus species (R. raphanistrum, R. maritimus, or another wild species) or from a common ancestor of the genus Raphanus. Furthermore, since wild Raphanus species are thought to have originated in the Mediterranean region,32 it would be reasonable to speculate that cultivated radish (R. sativus) also originated around the same area.It remains unclear how cultivated radish transferred from the West to East Asia. One possibility, as suggested by Kitamura,32 Huh and Ohnishi,33 and Wang et al.,34 is that the cultivated species (R. sativus) originated in the Mediterranean region and migrated towards the Black Sea and Caspian Sea, and then further to the East, i.e. East Asia, along a certain road such as the Silk Road. During migration, new varieties such as var. caudatus and var. hortensis probably originated, and then migrated to and domesticated in South Asia, Southeast Asia, and East Asia (Fig. 3a, hypothesis-a). Furthermore, R. sativus var. hortensis is thought to have been transported to Japan via Southern China. Possible migration route of cultivated Raphnanus species from the West to East Asia. (a) Conventional hypothesis, based on previous studies. (b) Proposed hypothesis, based on the results of this study. Arrow means direction of the migration.Possible migration route of cultivated Raphnanus species from the West to East Asia. (a) Conventional hypothesis, based on previous studies. (b) Proposed hypothesis, based on the results of this study. Arrow means direction of the migration.However, our results of phylogenetic analysis and PCoA led us to another hypothesis (Fig. 3b, hypothesis-b). Populations A–D detected by PCoA corresponded almost exactly to the phylogenetic clades 1–4. Based on the results of phylogenetic analysis, cultivated Raphanus species in the Asian group are inferred to have diverged from those in the Western group. Within the Asian group, the ancestors of East Asian and Japanese groups are inferred to have diverged from the South and Southeast Asian group. In the East Asian group, ancestral cultivars of some present accessions such as Rs2017_359, _360 and _361 in the southern area diverged from those in the South and Southeast Asian group. Furthermore, it is deduced that a part of the ancestral cultivars spread in southern area, while another part of the ancestral ones, which might have acquired cold tolerance possibly due to increase in genetic variation, migrated to the northern area. In addition, within the Japanese group, radish accessions in southwestern Japan (Nansei Islands), e.g. Rs2017_016, and in Kyushu area, e.g. Rs2017_158, diverge from those in the South and Southeast Asian group and then the others of mainland diverge. This implies that a part of ancestral cultivated varieties of the South and Southeast Asian group migrated towards the main island of Japan through southwestern area of Japan. Meanwhile, genetic variation might increase due to nucleotide substitutions and/or crosses between different cultivars. In summary, it is suggested that the cultivated species, R. sativus, originated in the West and migrated to the South and Southeast Asia, although a part of the cultivated species may have migrated further east from the West as suggested by Kitamura32 (a broken grey arrow, in Fig. 3b). Furthermore, those probably spread independently to area in China and to area in Japan from South and Southeast Asia (Fig. 3b; hypothesis-b).In the analyses of mitochondrial DNA, five different haplotypes of the cox1–orfB region detected among wild radish species have also been observed among populations from three different areas: Europe, Asia including China, Korea, and countries of the Southeast Asia, and Japan.35 However, the observed haplotypes showed a strong association with the geographical areas. For example, the European population contained one haplotype, whereas Asian populations contained four to five haplotypes. In addition, haplotypes within the Asian populations showed different frequencies,35 indicating that radishes were domesticated in the respective areas; this is supported by the results of a similar analysis of chloroplast genes.36 In addition, phylogenetic analysis of the chloroplast trnK/matK region conducted by Lü et al.21 indicated that three kinds of cultivated radishes, including European small radish, Asian big radish, and black radish, belong to different clusters, suggesting that the domestication of cultivated radish occurred independently in the respective areas. To further understand the route of migration of radishes in more detail, haplotype analyses of mitochondrial or chloroplast genes are needed in a large number of geographically diverse accessions.In genetic analyses such as QTL analysis and genome-wide association study, genetic distance between cultivars greatly affects the efficiency of analysis. A high degree of DNA polymorphisms among cultivars is expected to discover trait-associated loci or genes at a high resolution. SNP data revealed in this study will facilitate the selection of cultivars based on genetic analysis. Furthermore, SNP-related information will enable the production of DNA markers for the accurate identification of cultivars and will greatly contribute to the genetic analyses and breeding of radish cultivars.We thank Ms Marina Mitsui for assistance with growing plants and DNA extraction.

IntroductionRestriction–modification (R–M) systems are an essential part of the bacterial defense against invading DNA.1–5 The components of these systems, an endonuclease (REase) and a methyltransferase (MTase), work to either cleave or protect DNA in a sequence-specific manner. Given their opposing roles, it is reasonable to postulate that gene expression or other biochemical mechanisms have evolved to balance the activities of the MTase and the REase inside a host.6–12 Maintenance of an optimal balance is crucial for the integrity of the genome, the survival of the cell and the stability of the R–M system within a host. To avoid methylation of the incoming DNA before its restriction, it is essential that a potent anti-phage defense system is well established with optimal regulation within a narrow window of flexibility. The relationships between the strength of the antiviral defense and the cellular level of R–M protein production remain to be fully characterized. Regulatory control of R–M system gene expression favors relatively low levels of REase and MTase,13 and the REase is often under additional controls (dedicated controlling protein, regulatory MTase, or antisense RNAs) to prevent becoming toxic to the host.9The role of the R–M system in the context of a cell is not fully defined, and little is known about the possible impacts of aberrant DNA cleavage on host genome integrity. There seem to be critical moments during the cell cycle; otherwise, some regions of the host chromosome may become vulnerable to residual REase.12,14–17 R–M systems can be horizontally transferred between various genomes,18–22 and the effects of unbalanced expression are especially dramatic when the newly acquired R–M system is being established in a host with unprotected genome.20,23–28 Cell death during this period remains high unless the R–M system gene expression regulation reaches a fine-tuned balance facilitating survival. Proper balance is also critical for cell vitality during the loss of R–M genes, as the gradual decrease in modification activity leaves the chromosome exposed to restriction. This effect is lethal for the majority of cells.15,16,29–31 It is, therefore, not surprising that some R–M gene complexes are recognized as self-mobilizable elements.31–33In this study, we used the EcoRI R–M system of Escherichia coli as a model34–38 to study the relationship between ecoRIR and ecoRIM expression levels and test the factors of the optimal balance of their enzymatic activities. Originally, the genes of the EcoRI R–M system were discovered on a pMB1 plasmid located close to the highly site-specific recombinogenic cer site. Following the concerted action of XerCD and other accessory proteins, this region might serve as the multimer resolution crossover site for many cer-like sequence homologues.39–42 This region also contributes to Xer-independent dimer formation, but at very low frequencies.43 Previous studies reported that EcoRI R–M systems carried by ColE1-type plasmid derivatives are sometimes functionally unstable and result in a variety of R–M system phenotypes.44–47 Notably, the phenotypic alterations of the EcoRI R–M systems could not be attributed to simple insertion or deletion changes and the actual mechanism responsible for the observed conversion remains unknown (e.g. phenotypically cryptic restriction activity, which is not functional in vivo but is detectable after extraction from the same cells).45 Reported here analysis of the EcoRI R–M system in several plasmid backgrounds carried on P15A replicon derivatives48 revealed a range of restriction activity phenotypes (high, low, and completely abolished). Our results have provided a framework for understanding the previously observed phenotypic instabilities, by linking the disruption of the restriction/modification balance to changes in R–M operon gene expressions that appear to be the result of the R–M system’s close proximal genetic context. We propose that shaping of the functional diversity of R–M systems may likely be a consequence of the cycles of establishment events that occur in new hosts once the genes have been horizontally transferred. Our data provided further insights into Type II R–M system maintenance and the potential conflict within the host bacterium.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains and plasmidsEscherichia coli K-12 strains used in this work are presented in Table 1. Escherichia coli cells were grown in LB medium with antibiotics at the following concentrations when necessary: ampicillin (Ap) at 100 µg/ml, chloramphenicol (Cm) at 30 µg/ml, and tetracycline (Tc) 15 µg/ml. Isopropyl ß-d-1-thiogalactopyranoside (Sigma-Aldrich, USA) and l-arabinose (Sigma-Aldrich) were used as indicated in the experiments. Plasmids were introduced into chemically competent cells by a standard procedure.49 Their relevant features are presented in Supplementary Table S1 as well as information on their construction using oligonucleotides in Supplementary Table S2. Escherichia coli strains used in this workEscherichia coli strains used in this work2.2. Growth competition assayEscherichia coli MG1655 strains bearing or lacking the EcoRI R–M system were grown from single colonies. To quantitate the initial number of bacteria (CFU/ml) used for inoculation of a mixed culture, each strain was serially diluted and spread on LB plates. Each pair of the examined strains (MG1655, as a negative control without any Type II R–M systems) was also mixed at a 1:1 cell number ratio and diluted 1:50 into 10 ml of fresh LB without antibiotics. Each overnight co-culture (16–18 h at 37 °C) was then diluted 104 into fresh LB medium. The cycle of consecutive dilutions and growth of mixed cultures was repeated twice. Finally, each mixed competition culture was sampled, diluted, and spread quantitatively onto LB agar containing chloramphenicol and onto antibiotic-free LB agar plates. The colonies were counted and the ratio of cells carrying plasmids to the total number of cells was determined for each of the tested co-cultures.2.3. Phage restriction assayThe restriction activity of E. coli cells carrying the ecoRIR gene was measured by determining the efficiency of plating of phage <U+03BB>vir, which has four EcoRI sites50 and is unable to form lysogens. All experiments were conducted with freshly transformed cells. Serial dilutions of <U+03BB>vir phage in TM (10 mM MgSO4 and 100 mM NaCl) buffer were prepared from 1 to 108 cells. In the qualitative assay, 3 ml top agar preheated to 44 °C with 300 µl bacterial culture was poured on the LA bottom layer. Ten microliters of each serial dilution of a phage lysate was then spotted onto the top of the agar and incubated overnight at 37 °C. The quantitative assay involved a mixture of the appropriate phage dilution (100 µl) and host bacteria (10–300 µl, at OD600 = 0.6) and was incubated for 20 min at room temperature, then 3 ml of the top agar was added, mixed, and then poured onto the LA bottom layer. The plates were incubated overnight at 37 °C. The efficiency of plaque formation was calculated as the number of plaque-forming units (PFUs) obtained on bacteria with the tested plasmid divided by the number of PFUs on bacteria with the pACYC184 plasmid. Relative restriction (=1) denoted the EcoRI R–M system carried out on the pIM-RM plasmid.2.4. Quantitative real-time PCR analysisThree milliliters of E. coli ER1992 cells containing EcoRI R–M plasmids was harvested during exponential growth. The cells were centrifuged, then the bacterial pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of StayRNA reagent to prevent RNA degradation (A&A Biotechnology, Gdynia, Poland). The total cellular RNA was extracted using the Total RNA Mini Plus Kit (A&A Biotechnology) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. After elution, the RNA was treated with DNase I for 60 min at 37 °C (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) and then at 65 °C for 15 min to inactivate the enzyme. The RNA was then used as a template for first-strand cDNA synthesis using the RevertAid First Strand cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Three sets of primers (Supplementary Table S2) were used to estimate transcripts levels of ecoRIR, ecoRIM, and a housekeeping gene (16S rrn). Primers were designed to avoid regions involved in regulatory circuits.35,36 Each qPCR reaction (10 µl) contained 5 µl SG qPCR Master Mix (2×) with SYBR Green I fluorescent dye, Perpetual Taq DNA polymerase, and dNTPs (Eurx, Gdansk, Poland), 3 µl H2O, 1 µl of 5 µM forward and reverse primer mix, and 1 µl of diluted cDNA as a template. The qPCR was conducted using a Roche Lightcycler (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) using the following conditions: a predenaturation step at 94 °C for 3 min and 35 cycles at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 50 °C for 30 s, and polymerization at 72 °C for 20 s. The expected product lengths were 172, 170, and 170 bases for ecoRIR, ecoRIM, and 16S rrn, respectively. Biological triplicates were taken for each sample and the qPCR was independently repeated at least twice. Melting curve analysis was conducted to confirm the formation of the expected products. The quantitative model included the PCR efficiency for each cDNA and was obtained by serially diluting it and then plotting the Ct values against cDNA input to generate a slope.51,52 We observed high linearity (R2 > 0.98) for all measurements.3. ResultsWe noticed a substantial variation in DNA restriction, using a <U+03BB> phage plaque assay in the same E. coli host strain that carried several EcoRI R–M plasmids (Fig. 1A). The EcoRI R–M system located on the pACYCeco plasmid showed significantly higher phage restriction (similar to the pMB1-related NTP14 plasmid),47 in comparison to the system carried by the pIM-RM plasmid of the same P15A replicon (Supplementary Fig. S1).35,53 The differences were ~1,300-fold between these two plasmids, and 1,900-fold comparing the plasmid and chromosomal ecoRIRM locations (Fig. 1A). Notably, the nucleotide sequences of both systems were identical, and the promoter regions, consisting of the main PR promoter embedded within the binding elements of the Xer/cer recombination system and including Pcer promoter,36,54–56 were also very close in sequence. The differences involved the orientation of the EcoRI R–M operon with respect to the chloramphenicol gene and the presence of a weak constitutive promoter PL1 from the <U+03BB> bacteriophage,53,57 which was coupled to the <U+03BB> nutL anti-terminator (Fig. 2). Western blot analysis of the REase and MTase for both strains showed that high expression of the R–M system was not correlated with the observed antiviral activity (Fig. 1A vs. 1B). Paradoxically, plasmid pACYCeco, which confers high relative restriction, produced much less REase (below the level of detection in this assay) than the systems located on the pIM-RM plasmid or on the control plasmid, where the EcoRI MTase and REase enzymes were overproduced upon arabinose induction (Fig. 1B). We then sought to understand the basis for this highly varied expression and the lack of correspondence between REase levels and degree of restriction. Phage restriction variation in Escherichia coli cells carrying the EcoRI R–M system measured as phage <U+03BB>vir infection efficiency. (A) The qualitative assay involved 5 µl of serial dilutions of <U+03BB>b2vir phage, which were spotted onto LB agar plates with an E. coli ER1992 lawn carrying the indicated plasmids or no plasmids [ER1992E (EcoRI R–M)+ strain] and incubated overnight at 37 °C.

The names of plasmid constructs and modified promoters are given.3.1. The enhanced restriction phenotype was not due to N/nutL anti-terminationIt was possible that R–M system expression may be affected during <U+03BB> phage infection when the N anti-terminator protein was supplied, and this could cause for the high restriction pattern observed in the pACYCeco construct (nutL anti-terminator upstream of PR) (Fig. 2). To address this possibility, we provided N gene expression from the arabinose-inducing promoter of the pBAD-N vector (Supplementary Table S1) and measured the relative level of ß-galactosidase reporter inserted downstream of the nutL site (pACYClacZ) (Supplementary Table S1). We observed up to a 3.3-fold increase in ß-galactosidase activity when the N protein was present (Fig. 1C), which was in agreement with other reports detailing the effects of N protein on transcription.58,59We also used a time course to measure the kinetics of R.EcoRI production during <U+03BB> phage infection when the N protein was supplied by its natural source. We found higher levels of R.EcoRI protein in the <U+03BB> phage-infected bacteria when compared with the uninfected control cells (Fig. 1D). These results confirmed that REase levels were slightly higher when the anti-termination process was active, but the levels were still significantly lower than those produced in the pIM-RM background (Fig. 1C). We inactivated the weak tL0 terminator accompanying the nutL region58 in pACYCeco to produce pACYC<U+0394>nutL (Fig. 2; Supplementary Table S1), and, as expected, both the REase level (Fig. 1B, lane 5 vs. lane 2) and the relative restriction (phage assay, data not shown) remained unchanged. Consistent with this possibility was the observation of a 2-fold increase in LacZ activity when the reporter was cloned downstream of PL1 (pACYC<U+0394>nutLacZ; Supplementary Table S1) relative to the nutL-tL0 bearing pACYClacZ (Fig. 1C). These results indicated that the N/nutL elements were likely not responsible for the two distinct phenotypes observed for relative restriction (pACYCeco vs. pIM-RM).3.2. Additional upstream transcription for the EcoRI operon was responsible for the difference in restriction efficiencyWe next asked whether the observed differences in restriction efficiency might simply be due to varied ecoRIRM expressions in both plasmids. We designed lacZ translational fusions for the ecoRIR and ecoRIM genes, making sure that the EcoRI regulatory antisense RNAs were preserved.35 For the ecoRIM::lacZ fusion, the REase gene was first mutated, avoiding transcriptional polarity effects, but preventing active REase from being produced. A restriction-deficient REase mutant (Lys113Ala) was generated as previously reported.60 LacZ activity was measured for the two translational fusion constructs, ecoRIM::lacZ and ecoRIR::lacZ in both pIM-RM and pACYCeco derivatives (Fig. 3A). The results for fusions under their constitutive expression showed that both derivatives of pIM-RM had ~5-fold higher gene expression than the pACYCeco-derived plasmids (Fig. 3B; pIM-RMlacZR vs. pACYClacZR and pIM-RMlacZM vs. pACYClacZM). Quantitative RT-PCR of total RNA from cells carrying pACYCeco and pIM-RM was used to confirm the ecoRIR and ecoRIM transcript levels. As expected, higher levels (~14-fold for ecoRIR and 10-fold for ecoRIM) of the EcoRI operon expression for pIM-RM were observed when compared with pACYCeco (Fig. 3C). Quantitative densitometric analysis revealed 2-fold molar excess of M.EcoRI protein over R.EcoRI in early stationary phase for cells carrying pIM-RM. In addition, we cloned the araBAD promoter upstream of the PR promoter of the EcoRI operon (pACYCara plasmid; Fig. 2) to determine whether a strong upstream transcriptional signal might interfere with the two regulatory circuits responsible for the fine-tuned restriction/modification gene expression balance.35,36 Such constructs with lacZ reporter fused to ecoRIR and ecoRIM (pACYCecoARAlacZR and pACYCecoARAlacZM, respectively) generated EcoRI operon overexpression after arabinose induction [Fig. 3A (in brackets) and B]. Our results with pACYCara-based expression clearly showed that high operon induction was associated with lower relative restriction (<U+03BB>vir plaque formation) (Figs 3B and 4B), confirming the earlier results obtained for pBAD-RM construct (Fig. 1A and B, Supplementary Fig. S2). The EcoRI R–M expression level generated by pACYCeco and pIM-RM plasmid constructs. The LacZ reporter gene was used to construct translational fusions with ecoRIR endonuclease (pACYClacZR, pIM-RMLacZR, and pACYCecoARAlacZR) and ecoRIM methyltransferase (pACYClacZM, pIM-RMLacZM, and pACYCecoARAlacZM) genes.

ECL chemiluminescence with horseradish peroxidase-coupled goat anti-rabbit IgG was used to visualize the products. Culture samples were normalized by OD600. (B) PFUs of the previously mentioned plasmid-bearing bacteria.We reasoned that the only possible source of upstream transcription for the EcoRI operon in the pIM-RM plasmid was the constitutive promoter for the cat gene. Indeed, deletion of the cat promoter in pIM-RM or replacement with a DNA cassette carrying the kanamycin resistance gene (pIM-RMkan) restored a high phage restriction phenotype that was comparable to pACYCeco (Supplementary Table 3) by decreasing R–M expression (data not shown). A similar effect was obtained after transfer of ecoRIRM operon from pIM-RM to pBR322-derivative plasmid (data not shown).3.3. A higher REase production was associated with R–M system instability and SOS response inductionNext, we tested whether high (pIM-RM) or low (pACYCeco) levels of ecoRIR gene expression differentially affected the bacterial SOS response. We examined the cells by microscopy and found high levels of filamentation, a typical result of the SOS response.61,62 Filamentation was seen only for cells with the pIM-RM plasmid, but not for pACYCeco (Fig. 5A). To measure this phenomenon quantitatively, we used SOS-gfp/yfp reporter strains and found the levels of fluorescence to be high for cells carrying pIM-RM (Fig. 5B). Escherichia coli with pACYCeco or its derivatives, pACYCp and pACYCcer, did not show a similar effect (data not shown). These results indicated that the autorestriction of host DNA resulting from elevated cellular REase concentrations likely contributed to substantial SOS induction. We further measured the impact of REase regulation on cell viability by mixing an equal number of cells; an isogenic R-deficient strain (no plasmid) with the R-proficient strains (pACYCeco or pIM-RM), and then performed long-term competition assays. The mixed cultures were grown in rich media without antibiotic selection, and cell ratios were measured immediately at the start of growth and then again after ~60 generations. The strain carrying pIM-RM showed a significant decrease in cell viability when mixed with the restriction deficient control, when compared with the relatively balanced growth stability exhibited by the pACYCeco and plasmid (pIM27 R-M+) control strains (Fig. 5C). The SOS response induction and R–M system instability in cells carrying the plasmid with the high R–M genes expression. (A) Escherichia coli strain SS996, where the gfp gene is under the control of the PsulA promoter, was transformed with the following plasmids: pIM-RM (high R–M genes expression), pACYCeco (low R–M genes expression) and pBAD-RM, where REase expression was induced by 0.04% of l-arabinose for 2 h. Light and fluorescence microscopy images were captured. (B) The SOS response was also measured quantitatively for the same plasmids in E. coli strains with the YFP reporter gene under the control of the PsulA promoter in the background of recA+ (MP060) and recA- (MP064). As a control, the plasmid, pIM-RM, with a kanamycin resistance cassette inserted in cat gene upstream of the PR promoter for REase gene (pIM-RMkan) was used, as well as strains without plasmids. (C) Plasmids pIM-RM and pACYCeco (both restriction proficient R+M+; high and low REase producers) were challenged using a 3-day growth competition assay to generate the co-cultures with the MG1655 strain without a plasmid (no RM system). As a control, plasmid with a restriction-negative variant was also used (pIM27: R-M+). Briefly, strains without plasmid were mixed 1:1 with cells carrying plasmid with the R–M system variant and allowed to grow in the co-cultures for 60 generations. Chloramphenicol resistance was used as a selection marker for CFUs of cells carrying the R–M system variants. The cell viability was measured at Generations 1 and 60, and calculated as the ratio of the CFUs on LB agar supplemented with chloramphenicol to the CFUs obtained on LB agar.The SOS response induction and R–M system instability in cells carrying the plasmid with the high R–M genes expression.

The higher the R–M system expression, the less efficient phage DNA restrictionTo determine whether the high levels of ecoRIRM expression resulted in more effective methylation of invading DNA, we supplied cells carrying pACYCeco or pIM-RM with an arabinose inducible MTase (pBAD-ecoM). Upon induction of the MTase, we observed a significant reduction of restriction in pACYCeco-carrying cells (Fig. 6A) and a loss of the permanent SOS-induction in pIM-RM carrying cells (Fig. 6B and C). We confirmed that the high ecoRIRM expression level was primarily linked with an overmethylation of foreign DNA and with the loss of the phage restriction phenotype. The results from these experiments with the EcoRI R–M system helped to explain the observation that higher R–M gene expression correlated with lower relative restriction of phage DNA and vice versa. It appears then that bacteriophage resistance may only be potent when methylation and restriction are balanced and their gene expression is sustained at very low levels. Overmethylation alleviates the highly restrictive phenotype and suppresses the autorestriction defects. Escherichia coli ER1992 (A) or MP060 cells (B, C) carrying pACYCeco or pIM-RM plasmids were co-transformed with pBADecoM carrying the arabinose inducible ecoRIM gene. MTase expression was induced with 0.04% for 1 h at 37 °C (A) or overnight (B, C). Then, a quantitative assay for restriction <U+03BB>vir phage DNA was performed (A), and SOS-inducing YFP fluorescence was measured (B) or microscopy of cells was conducted (C).Overmethylation alleviates the highly restrictive phenotype and suppresses the autorestriction defects.

The Xer/cer recombination system embedded in the PR promoter region was dispensable for R–M system expressionThe genetic elements comprising the Xer/cer recombination system overlapped the PR promoter region (Fig. 2), so it is reasonable to assume that this region might contribute to the repression of the ecoRIRM operon. Previous reports have demonstrated that the synaptic complex formed during plasmid dimer resolution can block RNA polymerase from accessing the PR promoter, and that the PR region may be occupied by XerCD recombinases and the FIS protein during Pcer repression in plasmid monomers.54 To test whether binding sites for Xer/cer proteins were embedded in the EcoRI main promoter, PR (Fig. 2), impact expression, we used our phage restriction assay in bacterial strains with defective XerC, XerD, ArgR, and PepA.63 The results showed no significant change in the DNA restriction properties for cells containing pACYCeco (Supplementary Fig. S3). We also removed the Pcer promoter along with Xer/cer-binding sites for recombination and accessory proteins (plasmids: pACYCcer, pACYCxerCD, and pACYCpR) (Supplementary Table 1). We observed only a slight increase in REase production that still allowed for a high level of antiviral functioning (Fig. 7; Supplementary Table S3).

(B) Relative restriction of the above constructs expressed as the efficiency of plating.To further characterize the minimum promoter required by the EcoRI R–M operon to maintain high levels of phage restriction, we constructed several pACYCeco derivatives, where the PR promoter was shortened36 or certain elements were replaced (Fig. 7). We did not see an increase in DNA restriction levels even, when the -35 box of the main PR promoter was substituted with a consensus promoter sequence (TTAAGG<U+2192>TTGACA; pACYCp*) (Fig. 7). There was a significant loss in restriction activity with a single nucleotide change (TTAAGG<U+2192>ATAAGG; pACYC-35T) to the -35 hexamer of PR (Fig. 7). This might have suggested that PR could not function as a simple -10 extended promoter,64,65 despite the structural potential (TGTTAATTC).36 In another construct, we inserted the EcoRI wild-type (WT) core promoter elements (-35 and -10 sequences) into the weak promoter of the tetracycline resistance gene (PtetA). The construct maintained the WT leader sequence for the transcript (pACYCtet) (Figs. 2 and 7; Supplementary Table S3). Cells with this plasmid showed a dramatic loss in phage restriction (Supplementary Table S3). The untranslated upstream element for the promoter from bla is recognized as important in expression and is in some cases indispensable to maintaining the fine-tuning in gene expression.66,67 Leaving the WT PR promoter intact, we then replaced the region downstream of -10 hexamer with one similar to that from the bla gene promoter to create pACYCblaRBS (Fig. 2). The construct used part of the native RBS from bla, and cells bearing it exhibited low levels (comparable to pACYCtet) of <U+03BB> DNA restriction in the phage assay (Fig. 7). Overall, these results indicated a very high degree of optimization for each element present in the WT EcoRI R–M promoter region.4. DiscussionIn general, studies focused on dissecting the detailed mechanisms involved in the regulation of gene expression tend to dedicate more attention to operon coding sequences rather than the transcriptional signals coming from the sequences outside the protein-coding regions. In the present report, we used the EcoRI R–M system as a model to focus on how operon adjacent sequences affected the balance between the REase and MTase levels in Type II R–M systems.4.1. Sequences flanking the ecoRIRM operon affect the expression of the REase and MTase levelsWe tested the possibility that the ratio of restriction and modification activities must operate within a narrow window of variation in order to balance protection from invading DNA and unwanted cell death from autorestriction, in a similar manner to the activity of a toxin/antitoxin systems.9 The results from our plasmid-based regulatory studies suggested that the activity and function of an R–M system as well as its impact on cellular fitness were linked to the genotype of the host bacterium. Our finding that the cellular levels and ratios between the REase and MTase could be different in different genetic contexts was in agreement with the results from other studies of the EcoRI operon.10ColE1-like plasmids are small, high copy and mobilizable replicons, which are perceived as the main vectors for the acquisition, evolution, and dissemination of a wide variety of genes including the R–M determinants.68–70 Our database survey revealed the existence of several homologs of the EcoRI R–M system located on ColE1-like plasmids from the Enterobacteriaceae family (E. coli, GenBank: ANUR01000054.1, CYBB01000052.1, J01675.1, NZ_CCRA01000002.1, and NZ_LDDU01000010.1; Shigella sonnei, GenBank: M97479; and Citrobacter youngae, GenBank: ABWL02000046.1). Notably, in all these cases, the sequences within the promoters and the upstream regions were almost identical. The location of the crossover site between the two Xer-binding sites in the cer region, which affects the 3' portion of the -35 sequence,43 may indicate that this promoter region is recruited randomly after each recombination event when a hybrid DNA sequence is formed from two different widespread cer-like sites.41,71 The XerC/D-mediated generation of co-integrates between different plasmids increased the possibilities of their rearrangements and further horizontal dissemination among Gram-negative rods.70,72 A good example of this possibility was the P6 plasmid carrying ecoRIRM genes in S. sonnei (GenBank M9479). The loss of a single T in the sequence considered to be the -35 box of PR (TTAAGG<U+2192>ATAAGG)36 may be the result of recombinational crossover at this locus.40,42,43 Other experiments have already shown that cer hybrids may lose all conserved and essential nucleotides at the -35 box consensus positions.43 Given these insights, we think that one important factor for efficient control of ecoRIRM expression is the -10 box of the promoter because it can act as a classical extended -10 promoter.36,64,65 For the constructs and conditions tested, we showed that the extended -10 box could not compensate in the cases of a poor or absent -35 sequence (Fig. 7). These fluctuations in the R–M system promoter strength may be crucial to the predator/prey roles in the restriction/host relationship and to the adaptive impacts on horizontal gene transfer at the stage of gene establishment and maintenance of a new host.4.2. A high expression level of R–M results in loss of cell viabilityR–M system expression imbalance can result in a loss of viability and cell death or may even give rise to restriction-deficient phenotypes in some hosts.14,29,30,73–79 Examples of these phenomena include the accumulation of single-strand breaks at non-cognate sites observed when EcoRV REase is overproduced,11 and the autorestriction-based reduction in cell fitness that occurs after the induction of R–M expression leading to prominent rearrangements that inactivate the mboIIR REase gene by IS elements.80 Furthermore, long-term mixed culture experiments suggest strong selective pressure against the presence of a DNA cutting agent that affects cell fitness.81 To the best of our knowledge, most experiments related to the contribution of R–M systems to plasmid stability were performed in a single host strain making it difficult to directly estimate the impact of the post-segregational host killing phenomenon in a broader context,82,83 e.g. as an important factor, which could play a role in the competition between populations of strains with different restriction phenotypes. In addition, the growth conditions may significantly affect the CoE1 plasmid copy, so it should also be considered as a dosage-dependent gene regulation factor,84,85 as well as the presence of the growth spatial structure (as in solid medium), which may favor the cells with a suicide strategy.86,87Death of cells triggered by the degradation of their own DNA after R–M gene complex loss is linked to an enhanced decrease in methylated sites and exposure to cognate REase action.31,33 We used SOS response-reporter strains as a direct approach to understanding the impacts of optimal and sub-optimal levels in R–M enzyme activities. Cells carrying a plasmid with higher R–M enzyme production (pIM-RM) exhibited cell filamentation and a typical SOS response phenotype (Fig. 5A and B). It was reported that accidental DNA autorestriction events occur even in the balanced EcoRI R–M system.88 It was also reported that atypical cells with unusually high accumulations of Esp1396I R–M enzymes undergo filamentation and lysis.12 Therefore, it is not surprising that we could observe substantial filamentation with an overexpressed R–M system, where the cognate protection was insufficient. A high REase to DNA target site ratio can generate the undesirable cuts at non-protected and/or non-specific sites (star sites),78,89 which is a typical feature for REases conferring promiscuity toward the target site, such as the extensively studied EcoRI REase.90,91 Because the pIM-RM bearing strain was suppressed from autorestriction by the overmethylation of EcoRI MTase (Fig. 6B and C), the cleavage specificity of the EcoRI REase was unaltered at higher levels. In parallel, the restriction ability displayed by the pACYCeco-carrying strain decreased dramatically under the same conditions (Fig. 6A). We also used growth competition assays under non-selective conditions in recombination-proficient strains as an indirect measure of the effects of R–M system regulation. In long-term co-cultures, the isogenic strain without R–M system genes was competing against an R–M proficient strain (high or low producer). The higher R–M producer (pIM-RM) failed to compete with the restriction deficient strain (Fig. 5C). Notably, the pIM-RM culture colonies that formed on agar plates were different in size, and the smallest was composed of mostly filamentous cells. In contrast, the lower R–M producer (pACYCeco) was not outcompeted by the restriction-deficient strain. The observed fitness defect of cells carrying the high level R–M enzyme producer may reflect the need for longer-term adaptation of the R–M system in order to match the genetic background and the molecular interrelationship network of the new host.92 It may also support the observation that chromosomal R–M systems are better adapted to fulfill their biological function. Indeed, the majority of all discovered R–M systems are chromosomal and rarely present on low-copy replicons.93,94 However, it has recently been shown that the strength of post-segregational host killing is not simply a function of the number of recognition sites present on the chromosome but also a reflection of the properties of a particular R–M system, including protein stability.17,88,95,965. ConclusionWe think that the balance in restriction and modification activities from a single-copy R–M system is operating very close to the edge of imbalance, and this has profound biological implications considering the role of the REase in efficiently degrading foreign DNA before the methylation arm of the system renders the DNA resistant. Alterations in gene copy number or promoter strength that affect R–M gene expression and enzyme concentration may be triggered by specific nutritional and/or growth conditions, as well as by the impact of the new genetic context resulting from rearrangement of R–M genes into a new host. Regulation of gene expression for chromosomal R–M systems appears to be mostly free of these external (environmental) factors.We thank Prof. Ichizo Kobayashi (University of Tokyo) for the gift of the antibodies against R and M of EcoRI RM system.

IntroductionTransposable elements (TEs) are mobile DNA fragments that make up the largest fraction of eukaryotic genomes. For a long time, TEs were called ‘junk genes’ because they were thought to have no known function. In the past 30 years, research has shown that TEs play important roles in altering gene expression and structure,1–3 chromosome rearrangement,4,5 and the variability of genome size.6,7 Through these and other functions, TE transposition serves as an important source of genetic variation, and thus, TEs have been exploited for the genetic improvement in crops.Based on their different replication strategies, TEs in eukaryotes are divided into two broad classes: Type I elements (retrotransposons), which use an RNA-mediated mechanism for amplification, and Type II elements (DNA transposons), which use a DNA-mediated mechanism for transposition.8 Retrotransposons can amplify themselves into thousands or tens of thousands of copies, whereas DNA transposons rarely attain these levels, with the exception of miniature inverted-repeat TEs (MITEs).9 Each class of TEs contains autonomous elements, which have ORFs encoding the enzymes required for transposition, and non-autonomous elements, which do not encode transposition proteins but are still able to transpose.10 Short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) are non-autonomous retrotransposons and depend on transposition proteins derived from their autonomous partners, long interspersed nuclear elements (LINEs), for amplification.11SINEs range in length from 80 to 500 bp. They are a heterogeneous group of elements derived from a variety of RNA genes (tRNA, 7SL RNA, and 5S RNA),10,12 but most are derived from tRNA gene sequences.13 SINEs are characterized by a simple sequence repeat, usually a poly(A) at the 3' terminus, and an internal RNA Pol III promoter within the 5' terminus.14 SINEs, except SINE3 from zebrafish, are flanked by target site duplications (TSDs).12 These features are weakly conserved in plants, and thus, the annotation of SINEs is difficult and tedious via computer-based methods that are widely used for genome-wide identification of TEs.15 Recently, Wenke et al. developed an algorithm for the de novo identification of SINEs, named ‘SINE-Finder’.14 However, at present, there remains fewer comprehensive studies of SINEs in plants than there are for other classes of TEs.Although SINEs are short in length and compose small portions of eukaryotic genomes, they are abundant. In the human genome, there are over 1 million copies of the SINE Alu, which accounts for ~11% of the genome.16 On the other hand, SINEs are relatively rare in plants. In potato, there are 2,359 SINE copies comprising 0.15% of the genome, and in sugar beets there are 6,326 SINE copies constituting 0.18% of the genome.14,17Once integrated, SINEs are able to provide regulatory sequences to adjacent genes at a new integration site and thereafter have the potential to influence gene regulation. In mammals, SINEs are located throughout the genome, from intergenic regions to protein-coding genes,18 and there is evidence that SINEs regulate gene expression. The mouse SINE B1 contains functional TF-binding sites for the carcinogen-activated dioxin receptor Xenobiotic Responsive Element (XRE) and for the epithelial–mesenchymal transition regulator Slug,19 indicating that B1 acts as a cis-regulatory element on neighbouring genes. Human Alu RNA blocks the transcription of some protein-coding genes by binding Pol II and entering complexes of promoters during heat shock,20 demonstrating its trans-regulation on distal genes. SINEs also play roles in post-transcriptional gene regulation. In human and mouse myoblasts, SINEs accumulate in 3'-untranslated regions (3'-UTRs) and regulate gene expression by Staufen-mediated mRNA decay.21 In plants, SINEs are frequently associated with genes. Approximately 38% of the insertions are associated with transcribed regions in wheat, and 30% of SINE copies are associated with genes in Solanaceae,15,22 indicating that SINEs also have the potential to regulate gene expression and alter gene structure in plants.There are some reports that TEs are involved in the development of mutations in fruit. A MITE-like insertion in the promoter region of CitRWP generates polyembryonic citrus varieties with polyembryonic alleles.23 In Chinese box orange, a MITE insertion with a variable level of DNA methylation in the promotor of AbRuby2 affects the accumulation of anthocyanins in leaves.24 In apple, a columnar mutation is associated with an integration of a Gypsy-like retrotransposon.25 Over the years, the selection of different bud sports (somatic mutation) has given rise to many new fruit cultivars, particularly in seedless fruits such as sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) and Clementine mandarin (Citrus reticulata). SINEs, which are frequently associated with genes, have the potential to cause somatic mutation. However, the roles of SINEs in plant somatic mutation are rarely reported because SINEs are poorly investigated in plants, especially in citrus.In this study, we identified 12 SINE families in 7 citrus genomes and analysed their family characteristics, amplification patterns, and copy distribution. We showed that citrus SINEs are inserted preferentially into AT-rich areas and enriched in the promoter regions of genes. In addition, citrus SINEs can create novel genes and be co-opted into genes. These results indicated that SINEs have played important roles in the gene and genome evolution of citrus.2. Materials and methods2.1. Data resourcesGenome sequences and annotation files of sweet orange (C. sinensis cv. Valencia, 319 Mbp), Mangshan wild mandarin (C. reticulata, 334 Mbp), haploid pummelo (Citrus grandis, 346 Mbp), Ichang papeda (Citrus ichangensis, 357 Mbp), and citron (Citrus medica, 405 Mbp) were downloaded via the ‘Citrus sinensis annotation project’ homepage (http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn/orange/download/data.php).23,26 Genome sequences and annotation files of Clementine mandarin (C. reticulata cv. Clementina de Nules, 301 Mbp) were downloaded via the Citrus Genome Database homepage (https://www.citrusgenomedb.org/species/clementina/genome1.0) (Wu et al., 2014). Genome sequences and annotation files of Satsuma mandarin (C. reticulata cv. Miyagawa wase, 360 Mbp) were downloaded via the resources for citrus genomics homepage (http://www.citrusgenome.jp/).27 The expression data of sweet orange were queried from the ‘Citrus sinensis annotation project’ database homepage (http://citrus.hzau.edu.cn).282.2. Extraction of SINEsTo identify SINE candidates in citrus, we used the SINE-Finder program to search genome sequences using the default setting.14 In brief, the settings were as follows: a 5' TSD region of 40 nt, the box A motif RVTGG, a spacer of 25–50 nt, the box B motif GTTCRA, a spacer of 20–500 nt, six adenines or thymines as a poly(A/T) stretch or simple sequence repeats, and a 3' TSD region of 40 nt.The candidate sequences were clustered based on similarity using NCBI-BLAST 2.2.31+ toolkits.29 The procedure consisted of three steps: clustering of candidate sequences, verification of SINE copies, and family assignment.SINE candidates were clustered via all-against-all BLAST searches. In brief, an all-against-all BLAST was performed using the mega-BLAST algorithm with the following settings: qcov_hsp_perc of 80, perc_identity of 80, reward of 2, penalty of -3, gapopen of 5, gapextend of 2, word_size of 11, evalue of 10, no dust, and no soft_masking. The sequence with maximum homologues was retained while its homologues were removed. These two steps were repeated until no sequences had homologues. The remaining sequences were treated as representative copies.Representative copies were used as queries for mega-BLAST to search citrus genome sequences to verify the candidate sequences. Mega-BLAST settings were the same as those in the first step. Hit sequences plus 60 bp flanking sequences were extracted and aligned using MUSCLE.30 Alignments of each cluster were manually checked, and clusters without characteristics of SINEs or transposition hallmarks31 (where regions belonging to SINEs are highly similar, but flanking regions are usually unrelated sequences) were discarded.The remaining clusters were assigned into families via the construction of consensus sequences to perform all-against-all BLAST searches using the BLASTn algorithm with default settings, except that qcov_hsp_perc was 80, perc_identity was 80, and evalue was 10. Consensus sequences were constructed using SeaView.32 SINE clusters with significant similarity (qcov_hsp_perc of 80, perc_identity of 80, and evalue of 10) were combined into a SINE family. Each family was designated as a CitruS (Citrus SINE) with a different number. For verification of the family assignment, 20 full-length copies of the top hits for each family were aligned using MUSCLE29 prior to manual refinement and curation. Dendrograms were constructed with MEGA 7,33 applying the neighbour-joining distance method.The full-length copies of each family were retrieved by using consensus sequences as queries to search genome sequences with the BLASTn algorithm following default settings, except qcov_hsp_perc 80, perc_identity 80, and evalue 10. Retrieved sequences were aligned and checked to filter-out truncated SINE copies (the ends of homologous sequences varied by >5 bp). RepeatMasker34 searches against genome sequences were conducted using consensus sequences as queries to retrieve all copies of each family (including intact and truncated SINE copies) with the following settings: -nolow, -no_is, -par 28, -xsmall, and -gff. Overlapping SINE copies were fused to keep the outermost genomic coordinates using BEDTools35 under the following conditions: (i) overlapping SINE copies from an identical family were named after the original family and (ii) overlapping SINE copies from different families were named CitruS-composite.2.3. Identification of TSDs and insertion site preferencesFor identification of the TSDs of SINEs, a BLASTn search was performed using each full-length SINE sequence as a query with the default settings, except that word_size = 9, strand: plus, and evalue = 0.1. The results were filtered by size (10–40 nt) and location (upstream and downstream of SINEs).Five nucleotides of the flanking region upstream of the 5' TSD (positions -5 to -1) and the first six nucleotides of the 5' TSD (positions 0–5) of each full-length copy were extracted and aligned to investigate the insertion preferences of the SINEs. Sequence conservation at each position was graphically represented by Weblogo 3.362.4. Analysis of similarity profiles of SINE familiesSimilarity profiles of SINE families were calculated with a modified protocol as described by Schwichtenberg et al.,17 which was based on the sequence identity to the consensus sequence in each SINE family. In brief, a BLAST search was performed using consensus sequences as queries against all full-length copies, and then histograms were created using R script (https://www.R-project.org/) based on the resulting sequence identity data.2.5. Identification of SINE transpositionTo identify polymorphic SINE transposition sites in citrus, the leaves of 14 citrus cultivars were harvested from the collection at Huazhong Agriculture University (Wuhan, China). The DNA samples were isolated using Tiangen DP360 DNA extraction kit (Tiangen Biotech, Beijing, China).To experimentally validate the insertion polymorphism, 84 SINE copies from the CitruS-I and II families were randomly selected from the genome sequence of sweet orange to design three primers (one primer shared across two pairs) for each locus, with one set designed to amplify the complete SINE copy and the other for the 5' terminus of the SINE copy (Supplementary Table S1). Resulting polymorphic loci were mapped to the reference sequences of citrus using MUSCLE.29Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was conducted in a MJ-PTC-200 thermal PCR cycler (MJ Research, Waltham, MA) using the following program: 5 min of 94°C, 32 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 55°C for 30 s, 72°C for 60 s, and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. The reaction mixture (20 µL) contained about 20 ng of template genomic DNA, 0.2 µM each primer, 200 µM dNTPs, 1x PCR reaction buffer, and 1 unit of TaKaRa Taq™ DNA polymerase (Takara Bio, Beijing, China).2.6. Chromosomal localization and gene associationWe used MAPCHART37 to display the chromosomal localization of the citrus SINEs. The positional information (GFF) of each SINE was extracted from RepeatMasker outputs and converted to the format required by MAPCHART. The sequence lengths of the chromosomal pseudomolecules of sweet orange, pummelo, Satsuma mandarin, and the longest nine scaffolds of Clementine mandarin were calculated to define the expected length of chromosomes for MAPCHART.To analyse the association of the citrus SINEs with annotated genes, we compared the sites of SINE integration to the genomic coordinates of genes using BEDTools and the R packages systemPipeR and GenomicFeatures.38,39 The SINE family specific fraction of genes as well as the distances of intergenic copies to the closest neighbouring gene were determined as described.15 Genic regions were further distinguished into cds, introns, and UTRs according to the GFF annotation files. Intergenic regions were further distinguished into regions =1 kb upstream of genes, 1–2 kb upstream of genes, 2–5 kb upstream of genes, and =5 kb upstream of genes. When the downstream region of a gene overlapped with the upstream region of the next gene (0–5 kb), the overlapping region was excluded from the upstream region of the next gene (0–5 kb). The number of SINEs within each region was counted. Exemplary loci harbouring SINEs were manually refined and visualized with the respective annotations using Adobe illustrator CS6 (www.adobe.com). A dot plot of the dispersed duplication derived from truncated SINEs was calculated using the Emboss tool ‘Dotmatcher’ with the following settings: wordsize 20 and threshold 50.40The Chi-squared test was used to compare the expected and observed values for gene association. The theoretical expectation was calculated based on the portion (%) of features in the genome, which was determined based on the published gene annotations after fusing overlapping annotations.2.7. Comparative analysis of homologous SINE-containing lociSINE copies sharing both 5' and 3' flanking sequences were isolated from the alignment of each family to extract syntenic blocks. Then, 200 bp sequences flanking both ends of these SINE copies were extracted and aligned. SINE copies sharing identical flanking sequences (identity =80%) were referred to as homologous SINE-containing loci (HSCLs). Synteny for HSCLs was illustrated by Circos41 following the instructions provided by the author.3. Results3.1. Mining SINEs in citrus genomesUsing SINE-Finder and the public genome sequences of Clementine mandarin, Mangshan wild mandarin, Satsuma mandarin, pummelo, sweet orange, citron, and Ichang papeda, 10,632 SINE candidates were identified. To exclude false candidates, we developed a three-step pipeline to refine the output from SINE-Finder. In the first step, all-against-all BLAST searches using the mega-BLAST algorithm was performed to cluster the SINE candidates and find representative copies. Secondly, the representative copies were used as queries for BLAST searches to retrieve homologous sequences and flanking sequences from genome sequences. The resulting sequences were aligned, and 15 clusters were identified as SINEs, each of them harboured typical structural SINE features, such as RNA polymerase III promoter boxes A and B, poly(A/T) tails, TSDs, and transposition hallmarks.31 Clusters lacking any one of these features were removed. Thirdly, another all-against-all BLAST search was performed between the consensus sequences of 15 clusters using the BLASTn algorithm to find similarities between the clusters. The BLAST results revealed that these SINEs were grouped into 12 distinct families, designated CitruS-I to CitruS-XII (Table 1 and Supplementary Data S1), following Wicker’s ‘80-80-80’ criteria.8SINE families in seven citrus genomesnt: nucleotides; Clementine: Clementine mandarin; Mangshan: Mangshan wild mandarin; Satsuma: Satsuma mandarin.Including full-length copies and truncated copies.Consensus sequence without poly(A/T).Averaged length.CitruS-composite.Genome fractions covered by SINEs.SINE families in seven citrus genomesnt: nucleotides; Clementine: Clementine mandarin; Mangshan: Mangshan wild mandarin; Satsuma: Satsuma mandarin.Including full-length copies and truncated copies.Consensus sequence without poly(A/T).Averaged length.CitruS-composite.Genome fractions covered by SINEs.Consensus sequences of the 12 families were used as queries for BLAST searches against the 7 citrus genomes, resulting in 11,275 full-length copies (Table 1). Pummelo harboured the highest copy number, with 2,118 full-length copies, and citron harboured the lowest copy number, with 1,339 full-length copies. The lengths of the consensus sequences were highly variable, ranging from 192 nt (CitruS-XI) to 335 nt (CitruS-IV). RepeatMasker was utilized to find all of the members, including full-length copies and truncated copies that resulted from genomic rearrangements and/or termination of the RNA intermediate. A total of 41,573 full-length and truncated SINE copies were found among all seven citrus genomes (Table 1 and Supplementary Data S2), in which the number of SINE in each species ranged from 7,097 (citron) to 4,792 (Clementine mandarin). Hundreds of composite SINEs were identified that represented overlapping copies of SINEs from different families. The genome fractions covered by SINEs varied between 0.37%, in pummelo, and 0.33%, in mandarins (Clementine mandarin, Mangshan wild mandarin, and Satsuma mandarin).The number of full-length SINEs differed widely among the families (Table 1). CitruS-I was the most populous family, with >3,434 full-length copies across the seven citrus genomes, whereas the CitruS-III and CitruS-X families each contained <100 full-length copies. The remaining nine families had >340 full-length members. The abundance of the full-length SINEs differed from the number of all members (truncated and full-length) of each family identified using RepeatMasker.34 Some families had relatively few full-length copies but abundant truncated members. To shed light on this inconsistency, we calculated the copy number ratios of full-length copies to all members for each family (Fig. 1), referred to as the full-length rate. The average full-length rate of all citrus SINEs was ~0.27, which indicated that most copies of citrus SINEs were truncated during evolution. The average full-length rate varied among the SINE families, ranging from 0.02 in CitruS-X to 0.62 in CitruS-I. The differences in the full-length rate among the SINE families were substantially broader in different genomes, ranging from 0.01 (CitruS-X in citron) to 0.86 (CitruS-III in Ichang papeda). These data suggested that citrus SINEs experienced family specific evolutionary histories. The full-length rate of citrus SINEs characterized on the SINE family and genome level. Full-length rates for each family are presented for Clementine mandarin, Satsuma mandarin, Mangshan wild mandarin, pummelo, sweet orange, citron, Ichang papeda, and the average across all seven genomes (average).

The dashed line represents the average full-length rate of all citrus SINEs.3.2. Comparative analysis of citrus SINEsTo verify the structural features of citrus SINEs, each full-length SINE copy plus 60 nts of flanking sequences was extracted and compared. SINE copies within each family were highly conserved and shared sequence similarity of 80–100%, but their flanking regions were not similar, confirming the presence of transposition hallmarks.31 Two conserved motifs (box A and box B) were identified in all 12 SINE families (Supplementary Fig. S1).TSDs originate from the integration process of SINEs and thereafter retain residual information of the transposition process. Among the 11,275 full-length SINEs, we identified 4,793 with pair-matched TSDs (size threshold: 10–40 nt) (Supplementary Data S3). The TSDs averaged between 15 and 17 nt (Table 1). The length of individual TSDs was variable, with the majority of copies ranging from 10 to 22 nt (Supplementary Fig. S2). To illustrate the insertion preferences of the citrus SINEs, the families that had at least 30 full-length copies with detectable TSDs were further investigated. We examined five nucleotides of the flanking region upstream of the 5' TSD (positions -5 to -1) and the first six nucleotides of the 5' TSD (positions 0–5) of each SINE copy (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S3). Generally, citrus SINEs preferentially integrated upstream of short adenine stretches (positions 0–5), with the first two nucleotides of the TSD (positions 0–1) most likely being adenine. The flanking region upstream of the TSD (positions -4 to -2) was A/T rich. However, the first nucleotide upstream of the TSD (position -1) was rarely adenine. The 5' termini of TSDs were rich in adenines, which likely overlapped with the poly(A) tails. The variations in the lengths of poly(A) tails were not evaluated to avoid bias derived from overlap between poly(A) tails and TSDs.

The insertion site preferences of the remaining seven SINE families are shown in Supplementary Fig. S3.To visualize the divergence and grouping of the SINE families, we attempted to construct a dendrogram using the 20 full-length SINE sequences from each family with the highest similarity to the consensus sequence. A trial construction of the dendrogram failed due to the presence of three excessively divergent families. However, a dendrogram was constructed when the remaining nine families that formed separate branches were used. The families CitruS-II and CitruS-VI were assigned to two subfamilies and grouped on separate branches (Fig. 2B). The consensus sequences of CitruS-II a/b and CitruS-VI a/b showed identity values of 82.2 and 82.1%, respectively. In contrast, the consensus sequences of CitruS-VII and IV show identities of 70%, due to which they are classified as distinct SINE families rather than subfamilies.3.3. Estimation of the age and transposition activity of the SINEsThe lengths of TSDs and poly(A) tails are indicators of the relative insertion time of individual SINE copies.15,17,42,43 In citrus, the lengths of the TSDs and poly(A) tails were not eligible as an age indicator because more than half of the full-length copies did not have detectable TSDs, and the poly(A) tails were likely to overlap with short adenine stretches of the TSDs. Therefore, these could not be utilized to determine the age of the SINE copies in citrus. Generally, SINE copies were ‘copied and pasted’ a long time ago, leading to the accumulation of mutations. As the consensus sequence is a suitable approximation of the original source copy, the decreasing identity of a copy to the consensus sequence can serve as an alternative way to estimate its age.15,44,45To estimate the activity of a SINE family, we calculated copy numbers relative to sequence similarity intervals for the families/subfamilies that had at least 30 full-length copies (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S4). Figure 3 shows typical examples of SINEs with family- and genome-specific transposition patterns. In some families, for example CitruS-I in sweet orange, each similarity interval contained a relatively consistent copy number, suggesting that this family had consistent activity over a long period (Fig. 3A). In pummelo, all CitruS-I copies were at least 90% similar to the consensus sequence, indicating a recent activity of this family in pummelo (Fig. 3B). Some families, for example CitruS-XI in Satsuma mandarin, were predicted to be old, because all SINE copies had similarities of <91% to the consensus sequence (Fig. 3C). Peaks of ~90% similarity were identified in some families, for example CitruS-VII in sweet orange, which suggested that there was an ancient rapid amplification of these families (Fig. 3D). Comparison of copy numbers and sequence similarities among citrus SINE families. For three SINE families, histograms were created based on the identity of each full-length SINE copy within the family to the consensus sequence. Different example patterns are shown, namely, (A) a consistent activity over a long period, (B) a recent activity, (C) transposition activity a long time ago, and (D) an aged, rapid amplification. The complete data for the remaining 74 SINE families by genome are shown in Supplementary Fig. S4.Comparison of copy numbers and sequence similarities among citrus SINE families. For three SINE families, histograms were created based on the identity of each full-length SINE copy within the family to the consensus sequence. Different example patterns are shown, namely, (A) a consistent activity over a long period, (B) a recent activity, (C) transposition activity a long time ago, and (D) an aged, rapid amplification. The complete data for the remaining 74 SINE families by genome are shown in Supplementary Fig. S4.CitruS-I and CitruS-II were used to search for polymorphic SINE copies in citrus to verify different amplifications. For each locus, three primers were designed to form two primer pairs in order to amplify two overlapping products, the complete SINE copy and the 5' terminus of the SINE copy, with one primer upstream of the SINE copy, one primer downstream of the SINE copy and one primer inside the SINE copy. We detected a polymorphic SINE copy that was mainly derived from CitruS-IIa (CitruS-composite) in 14 citrus accessions (Fig. 4A and B). The SINE copy was absent in all 3 pummelo accessions but was present in the remaining 11 accessions, namely, 4 accessions of mandarin and 7 accessions of sweet orange. Moreover, two accessions of mandarin were homozygous for a SINE insertion, and the remaining nine accessions were heterozygous. There were no SINE insertions in a locus located in the sixth intron of a polygalacturonase gene in the published reference genome of Clementine mandarin (cv. Clementina de Nules) (Fig. 4C), but the PCR results showed that the locus was heterozygous for the SINE insertion (cv. Caffin). Genomic sequence variations derived from SINE insertion.

Gene association and chromosomal distribution of citrus SINEsTo shed light on the association of SINEs with genes, we analysed the frequency and position of citrus SINEs relative to annotated genes (Fig. 5A). On average, 7.9% of citrus SINEs were located in genes, of which the majority was found in introns and UTRs. Only 0.5% (0.1–1.4%) of citrus SINEs were found in coding regions of genes (cds). Based on the physical length of the annotated genes,26 an average of 29% (25–36.4%) of the citrus genome sequences were annotated as genes, which indicated a highly significant depletion of SINEs in genic regions compared with the expectation by random distribution according to Chi-squared tests (P < 0.001). Approximately 18.4% of citrus SINEs were found in close proximity (=1 kb upstream) to genes, which indicated a significant enrichment of SINEs in promoter regions (P < 0.001). Approximately 38.7% of citrus SINEs were 1–5 kb upstream of the next gene, and 34.9% were located more distantly (>5 kb). The fact that SINEs were enriched in promoter regions suggested that SINEs have the potential to influence the regulation of the expression of neighbouring genes.

The average distribution across all seven genomes is shown in ‘the average of citrus’. (B) Chromosomal mapping of all SINEs in pummelo, sweet orange, and Satsuma mandarin. Scale provided in Mbp.There were evident differences between the individual SINE families in the association with genes in all citrus genomes. The family CitruS-I accounted for at least 29.8% of SINEs located in cds in sweet orange, Satsuma mandarin, and Clementine mandarin, but no genic SINEs in the remaining four genomes (Supplementary Fig. S5). Overall, the CitruS-I and VIb families were the top two genic SINE fractions in citrus (16.5 and 12.5%, respectively).The localization of SINE copies was investigated on chromosomal pseudomolecules of Satsuma mandarin, sweet orange, and pummelo to determine the chromosomal distribution of citrus SINEs. The citrus SINEs had a dispersed distribution, with a preference for distal to subterminal regions on some chromosomes (Fig. 5B). Nevertheless, citrus SINEs had small regions of local depletion. The distributions of citrus SINEs also showed family specific differences. For example, the highly abundant CitruS-I and VIb mapped along chromosomes with different patterns in Satsuma mandarin, sweet orange, and pummelo (Supplementary Fig. S6).3.5. Contribution of SINEs to gene and genome evolutionAll cds containing SINEs in sweet orange were examined as an example to elucidate the role of citrus SINEs in gene and genome evolution. Comparison of the gene annotations indicated that SINEs might affect transcript structure as they contribute exons as well as splice sites and start and stop codons (Fig. 6). In Fig. 6A, a SINE copy was integrated into the sixth intron as a new exon and contributed two splice sites, maintaining the reading frame of the downstream region. The SINE transcript harboured the 3' splice site (AG) of the sixth intron and the 5' splice site (GU) of the seventh intron. In Fig. 6B, a SINE copy provided the first exon, a start codon, and a 5' splice site. Citrus SINEs donating stop codons (Fig. 6C and D) were also identified in genes.

Citrus SINEs were identified that (A) created a new exon and contributed two splice sites, (B and F) provided the first exon donating a start codon and (B) a 5' splice site, (C and D) donated stop codons, and (E, F) created novel genes.We identified 10 short genes containing only one exon (Supplementary Table S2), eight of them encoding unrecognized proteins, one encoding a WRKY DNA-binding protein (Cs8g16370), and one encoding a retrotransposon protein (orange1.1t01062.1). Further investigation revealed that these genes were derived from a SINE and its flanking sequences, in which the SINE provided the start/stop codons or part of the internal codons (Fig. 6E and F). Upon query of the publicly available RNA-seq dataset (citrus.hzau.edu.cn) derived from callus, leaf, flower, and fruit of sweet orange, we found that all 10 genes were expressed at low or moderate levels. The gene Cs5g04640 was significantly up-regulated (P < 0.01) in fruit compared with callus (Supplementary Table S3). These data suggested that these 10 genes were able to transcribe into RNA. In 5 kb of flanking regions, there were no sequences annotated as TEs surrounding the retrotransposon gene orange1.1t01062.1, which indicated the gene orange1.1t01062.1 was not likely a part of another TE. The gene Cs8g16370, encoding a homolog of a functional protein, was mainly derived from a SINE. Therefore, we inferred that orange1.1t01062.1 and Cs8g16370 might be co-opted from SINEs, and the remaining eight small genes were likely novel genes created by SINEs. In addition, we found tandem amplification and dispersed duplications derived from truncated SINEs (Supplementary Fig. S7), which suggested that SINEs participate in genomic rearrangements.3.6. Comparative analysis of HSCLAlignment of full-length SINE copies revealed hundreds of clusters of SINE copies that shared almost identical flanking sequences (Supplementary Fig. S8), indicating that these SINEs were located in homologous loci. Two hundred base pairs of flanking sequences at both ends of each copy in each cluster were extracted and aligned. Loci in which SINE copies shared identical flanking sequences (identity =80%) were designated HSCLs. HSCLs were divided into unique HSCLs and multiple HSCLs according to their number of occurrences in each genome. The number of occurrences of HSCLs was not consistent in all seven genomes due to family specific amplification of citrus SINEs after speciation. We identified 1,038 unique HSCLs shared by sweet orange, pummelo, and Clementine mandarin, of which 234 were shared by all three species, 331 were shared by sweet orange and pummelo, 375 were shared by sweet orange and Clementine mandarin, and 99 were shared by pummelo and Clementine mandarin. Given that sweet orange is a descendant of ancient pummelo and an ancestor of Clementine mandarin,26,46 those data may reflect the evolutionary relationship between these species.The chromosomal localization of the SINE copies in the unique HSCLs based on their physical positions was visualized on chromosomal pseudomolecules of sweet orange, pummelo, and the nine longest scaffolds (>10 Mbp) of Clementine mandarin (Supplementary Fig. S9A) to illustrate the synteny of unique HSCLs that amounted to orthologs. Although the majority of unique HSCLs retained substantial synteny, chromosomal rearrangements were observed when we compared the unique HSCL distribution at the chromosome level. For example, while sharing the majority of syntenic blocks with chromosome 4 of sweet orange, scaffold 1 of Clementine mandarin has some blocks homologous to chromosomes 7 and 1 of sweet orange (Fig. 7A). Similar patterns of synteny and chromosomal rearrangements were found among sweet orange, pummelo, and Satsuma mandarin (Supplementary Fig. S9B and Fig. 7B). These syntenic blocks derived from unique HSCLs might provide a robust and precise sequence framework for understanding citrus genome evolution and aid in the assembly of chromosomal pseudomolecules in citrus.

In current citrus genome annotations, SINEs are either underestimated or absent compared with our results.23,26,27,47 The difficulty in mining SINEs and their low proportions in the genomes may explain the incomplete annotation of SINEs in these released genomes. The absence of annotated SINEs will hinder the calling of genome structure variants, ultimately compromising all efforts based on next generation sequencing. In the present study, we identified 41,573 SINE copies in 12 families in seven citrus genomes. Some of these SINE copies were associated with genes, which indicate that the insertion of SINEs around genes may be an important source of variations in gene expression and structure.Our preliminary results are based on the results of using SINE-Finder.14 Approximately half of the candidates were either parts of other TEs (such as LTR retrotransposons) or not TEs, which diminishes the efficiency of mining for SINEs. In the present study, we developed a pipeline to filter and cluster the SINE candidates produced by SINE-Finder.14 The pipeline is based on NCBI-BLAST+ tools29 with the ‘qcov_hsp_perc’ and ‘perc_identity’ options, which enabled us to remove false candidates and follow Wicker’s ‘80-80-80’ rule8 for SINE family assignment.Wenke et al.14 proposed a new rule for SINE family assignment because they believed that the heterogeneity in the sequences and lengths of SINEs contradicted the criteria for the SINE family assignment suggested by Wicker et al.8 Thereafter, Schwichtenberg et al.17 assigned Amaranthaceae SINEs to the same family when they shared at least 60% similarity, resulting in 22 SINE families. This is why the full-length SINE copies in our study showed an average sequence similarity of 84–91% to the consensus, while the average sequence similarity ranged from 60 to 100% in Wenke et al.14 and Schwichtenberg et al.17The copy number of TEs is the result of the balance between amplification and partial or complete loss.47 Amplification and loss lead to lineage-specific TE copy numbers and copy number variation across families.10,15,48,49 In the present report, we found that the copy number of full-length SINEs varied significantly across SINE families and that the variations had family specific patterns in citrus. The full-length SINE copies represented recent amplifications or retentions of the intact sequences, while truncated SINEs may result from an incomplete reverse transcription during SINE transposition or partial removal of genomic SINE copies. The full-length rate of SINE families might be an indicator of the balance between SINE amplification and partial loss. Therefore, we inferred that many members of the CitruS-I and CitruS-III families might be newly formed or stably intact based on their full-length rates and activity estimates.Site-preferential insertion is observed in many classes of TEs.50–53 Our results showed that SINEs have a very strong preference to integrate upstream of short adenine stretches, which strongly resemble the cleavage site specificity of human LINE L1 endonuclease.54 SINEs are non-coding and require both active LINEs and sequence-dependent recognition of the SINE 3' end by the LINE reverse transcriptase for retrotransposition.14 Our results indicate that citrus SINEs might use reverse transcriptional machinery of LINE L1. The strong preference for AT-rich areas also indicates that citrus SINEs preferentially insert into areas with light cytosine methylation, compared with GC-rich areas. As inferred from previous reports,14,17 site-preferential insertion may be a reason for the enrichment of citrus SINEs near genes. While LTR retrotransposons, the most abundant TEs in plants, are enriched in heterochromatin and silenced by DNA methylation of cytosine nucleotides and histone methylation,55–58 SINEs are not enriched in telomeric and centromeric heterochromatin.59 In citrus, SINEs also have a dispersed distribution pattern along chromosomes. Site-preferential insertion might be one possible explanation for the distribution patterns of SINEs on chromosomes.The 12 citrus SINE families compose 0.35% of the citrus genome on average, which is much less than the content of SINEs in the human genome.16 These results also show that SINEs are not as abundant as other types of TEs in plants.47,60,61 However, >28% of the SINE copies were located in genic and adjacent areas (cds, introns, UTRs, and 1 kb upstream of gene) in the citrus genome, which is consistent with observations in Amaranthaceae and Solanaceae species.14,17 These observations suggest that SINEs are often associated with genes.Our results revealed that citrus SINEs promoted gene evolution by their insertion into promoter regions, by increasing UTR and intron lengths, by providing splice sites, exons, and start and stop codons, and by creating novel genes. These events are called TE co-options. TE co-options are involved in changing the patterns of gene expression, changing the functions of the proteins they encode, or both.62 We believe that in citrus, SINEs were co-opted into genes by providing new potential regulatory sequences to adjacent genes, altering gene structure, and creating novel genes. Interestingly, new SINE integrations may create novel genes.Our results showed that there was a highly significant depletion of SINEs in genic regions, which might be the result of the transposition of SINEs under selective constraints. This finding suggests that SINE insertions in genic regions might account for only a small fraction of alterations in gene structure. However, SINEs are enriched in promotor regions (=1 kb upstream of genes), indicating that SINEs might serve as regulatory sequences of neighbouring genes in citrus. TEs respond to biotic and abiotic stresses, including pathogens, extreme environmental conditions, polyploidization, and interspecies hybridization.15,63–65 DNA methylation of inserted TEs also affects gene expression.24 Therefore, we speculate that SINEs might play roles in regulating gene expression through insertion into the regulatory sequences and dynamic changes in DNA methylation.The insertion of a SINE creates a new allele at each specific locus, which can be inherited by descendants to form HSCLs. HSCLs were unique in each genome except those located inside duplicated genomic regions. The distribution and abundance of unique HSCLs can function as indictors of chromosomal rearrangements. There is a complicated phylogenetic relationship among citrus species. For example, sweet orange, the most widely cultivated citrus, is the offspring of previously admixed individuals derived from pummelo and mandarin, while Clementine mandarin (also known as Algerian tangerine) is a hybrid of Mediterranean mandarin (Willowleaf) and sweet orange.45 Comparative analysis of unique HSCLs revealed some chromosome rearrangements, suggesting that unique HSCLs are useful tools for ancestry research. Similar patterns of chromosome rearrangements were found between mandarins (Clementine and Satsuma) and sweet orange, which reflected the similar genetic background between Clementine mandarin and Satsuma mandarin. With the widespread use of next generation sequencing, we now have the chance to observe a different aspect of the forces that shape molecular evolution by studying gene sequence variation within a species.66 Unique HSCLs might be useful tools for comparison of intraspecies variation, too. Nevertheless, the use of unique HSCLs in evolution research has limitations, because the mining of syntenic HSCLs depends on high-quality genome assembly.The accuracy of our results relied on the quality of the de novo sequencing of the genome. Constant improvement in genome sequences due to ongoing assembly, anchoring and orientation of scaffolds and annotation will improve the identification and annotation of SINEs.17 Our results that SINEs play an important role in gene and genome evolution will serve as a foundation for future investigations of TEs in citrus.We would like to thank Anita K.

IntroductionThe term environmental RNA interference (RNAi) refers to a mechanism in which cells or species can take up regulatory RNA from the medium, food or the environment.1 Two surprising findings contribute to this phenomenon: RNA can be taken up into cells systemically distributed among multicellular organisms. Second, the foreign RNA can be processed into small RNA with regulatory power in gene regulation, thus environmental RNA is capable of interfering in gene expression.dsRNA uptake mechanisms have been intensively studied in the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, where two RNA transporters have been identified. Sid-2 imports dsRNA from the gut-lumen into cells, and Sid-1 is necessary for systemic RNAi, i.e. to transport short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) from cell to cell.2,3 Although the Sid-1 channel is widely distributed in many but not all eukaryotes, a systematic analysis of Sid-1 positive species for being capable of systemic RNAi is missing. One reason for that is probably Sid-deficient nematode species also shows systemic RNAi.4 As a result, there seem to be many undiscovered mechanisms for species to realize environmental RNAi.Nevertheless, this system seems to be quite attractive for biotechnology: dsRNA could be seen as a drug and easily delivered to cells and organisms to control, e.g. virus replication. In addition to the initial studies in C. elegans, many studies have investigated the oral administration of bacterial-, plant- or in vitro-transcribed dsRNA to shrimp,5,6 planarians,7 and insects8 making significant progress in the usage of dsRNA as a species-specific drug for pest control. However, little is known about off-target effects and a suitable risk assessment for artificial dsRNA in the environment, in genetic engineered plants or in animal farming.We therefore need to understand more about individual RNA uptake and individual siRNA accumulation pathways of different species. The issue becomes even more important as cells and species usually do not only show a single but also several RNAi mechanisms occurring in parallel. Often different small RNA species, e.g. siRNA, micro-RNA (miRNA), or piwi-interacting RNA (piRNA) are involved. Moreover, these mechanisms are not independent, but share individual components. Dicer for instance, responsible for sRNA cleavage from dsRNA, has been shown to be involved in many different mechanisms, e.g. C. elegans Dcr-1.9 Cleavage of these dsRNA occurring in equal intervals is called phasing.10 Importantly there is not only an overlap between different siRNA mechanisms but also to the miRNAs. Feeding of exogenous dsRNA (exo-dsRNA), and subsequent siRNA accumulation, was shown to increase transcript levels of miRNAs targets, thus implicating a competition between environmental and endogenous RNAi on the siRNA and miRNA level.11We used Paramecium tetraurelia, a single-celled free-living genetic model to analyse the effect of dsRNA feeding on the endogenous siRNA (endo-siRNA) population and endogenous gene regulation. This organism is capable of RNAi by feeding dsRNA producing bacteria12 and the underlying mechanisms have been intensively studied. Two RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RDRs) and DCR1 are necessary for primary siRNA production, but the genetic requirements for secondary siRNA products are less clear.13–15 A recent genome wide study identified 2,602 endo-siRNA producing loci. Of these, 1,618 endo-siRNA loci overlap with annotated genes in different transcriptomic states (serotypes) of Paramecium.16 This study also revealed that many endo-siRNA loci depend on the two RDRs (RDR1 and RDR2), which are involved in the feeding pathway, too. This may indicate that there could be a mechanistic overlap between endo- and exo-RNAi. Paramecium does not show any canonical miRNAs. In contrast to other organisms, Paramecium’s endo-siRNAs are not strictly associated with gene silencing, because many highly expressed genes show high abundance of siRNAs as well.16 These may be involved in trans silencing processes or they might be the result of unspecific accumulation such as spurious Dicer activity or inefficient siRNA degradation mechanisms.In this study, RNAi was applied to two different serotypes cultivated at different temperatures to analyse the phenomena in different backgrounds, because serotypes differ not only in the expression of the individual serotype gene but also large parts of their transcriptome.17 Moreover, some small RNA pathways in Paramecium also show a temperature dependency, as transgene induced silencing of the ND169 gene works most efficiently at high temperatures (31°C).18 Using RNAi by feeding, we introduced dsRNA against the major Dicer gene, DCR1, and a control gene, ND169. We investigated the effect of exo-dsRNA to the accumulation of the recently identified 1,618 endo-siRNAs overlapping with annotated genes, in different transcriptomic states (serotypes) in Paramecium. We aimed to dissect the genetic requirements of phased and non-phased endo-siRNAs as well as to analyse these for potential genome wide off-target effects by deep sequencing of siRNAs and mRNA.2. Materials and methods2.1. Cell culture and RNAiSerotype pure cultures of P. tetraurelia stock 51 were cultivated under standard conditions using Klebsiella planticola infused WGP (wheat grass powder) medium [wild-type (WT) cultures]. Serotype 51A cultures were kept at 31°C, 51B at 24°C, and checked for surface antigen expression by immobilization with polyclonal antibodies as described.17 RNAi by feeding was carried out as previously described using Escherichia coli.12,19 The feeding fragments used for dsRNA synthesis had the following genomic positions (kind gift of E. Meyer, Paris): scaffold51_70:312063-313251 for DCR1 (PTET.51.1.G0700179) and scaffold51_21:137857-138267 for ND169 (PTET.51.1.G0210080).2.2. RNA isolation and sequencingTotal RNA was isolated from vegetative cells (autogamy was checked by nuclei staining with DAPI) using Tri-Reagent (Sigma) as described20 before. After additional DNAse digestion and subsequent purification with acid phenol, sRNA fractions were enriched by denaturing gel electrophoresis and cutting the gel from 17 to 25 nts. After re-isolation of the sRNAs by extraction in 0.3 M NaCl, sRNAs were precipitated and we used the NEB Small RNA library preparation Kit (New England Biolabs) with elongated 3´-adapter ligation to limit biases against 2´-O-methylated siRNAs. Long RNA libraries were prepared after poly-A enrichment using the NEBNext Ultra directional RNA preparation Kit (New England Biolabs). Both setups were sequenced on a HiSeq2500 (Illumina), sRNAs in Rapid mode and long RNA in High Output mode. Reads were trimmed for adapters and low-quality bases by the cutadapt (version 1.4.121) wrapper trim galore (version 0.3.3; https://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/trim_galore/, accessed 28 April 2020).2.3. Data descriptionWe utilized the sRNA-seq replicates of WT serotype 51A, and 51B, which we obtained from our recent study16 (Cluster definition data; ENA Accession: PRJEB25903). Further we performed sRNA-seq on RNAi knockdown samples (two replicates each for both 51A, and 51B serotypes). We obtained mRNA expression data for WT serotypes (51A, 51B) produced as part of our earlier study17 (ENA Accession: PRJEB9464). Additionally, we sequenced mRNA from RNAi knockdown samples (three replicates each for 51A, and 51B serotypes). All RNAi knockdown sequencing datasets produced for this study can be accessed at ENA (Accession: PRJEB33364).2.4. Quantification of small RNAWe pre-processed the sRNA datasets to represent only 21-25 nt sRNA reads in this study. We retrieved the locations of the 1,618 endo-siRNA loci, which overlap with annotated genes from the supplementary methods of Karunanithi et al.,16 and quantified them using the RAPID software.22 We utilized the default parameters of RAPID, which performs error-free alignments using bowtie2,23 while allowing multi-mapping reads.2.5. Normalization of small RNA dataWe performed the knockdown corrected scaling (KDCS) normalization method22 implemented in RAPID to normalize the sRNA read counts. In a nutshell, the KDCS method subtracts the reads aligning to the feeding associated regions from the estimated read library size before performing a total count scaling.Let us assume that we want to normalize the reads for an endo-siRNA locus with a read count of R. The total number of reads in the respective library mapping to the genome is T, with K number of feeding associated reads. We define the normalized read abundance of the endo-siRNA region, R', as R'=R×M/(T-K)<U+2060>, where M is the maximum of the values (T1-K1),..,(Tn-Kn) for n samples.All sRNA data normalization in this work is done using the KDCS method, except for Fig. 1E. As we want to show the abundance of the feeding associated reads in Fig. 1E, we correct for changes in total sequence depth (total count scaling) but do not correct for small RNA reads from the feeding region. Under the assumptions described earlier, we perform total count scaling as R'=R×M/T where M is the maximum of the values T1,..,Tn of all n samples.Strand-specific small RNA coverage (y-axis; log2) of the genes ND169 (A and B), DCR1 (C and D) in the respective serotype-knockdown library is shown. (E) A bar plot showing the normalized sRNA read counts (y-axis) of the knocked down RNAi genes in the respective serotype-knockdown samples (x-axis; library).

(F) Fold change of gene expression (TPM in knockdown vs. TPM of wild-type of mRNAs targeted by primary siRNAs in both serotypes).2.6. Quantification of mRNA expressionWe used Salmon24 (version 0.8.2) to quantify the mRNA expression in transcripts per million (TPM), with default parameters. All quantifications were done using the recent annotation25 of P. tetraurelia MAC genome (version 2; stock 51). Mean of replicates were used for all analyses, unless otherwise mentioned. While calculating the expression of the knockdown genes in Fig. 1F, we excluded the feeding-associated regions from the transcripts for the respective RNAi knockdown samples. To account for alignment artifacts, we added 100 bps both upstream and downstream, while excluding the feeding-associated regions.2.7. Clustering of expression dataWe created heatmaps of the endo-siRNA and mRNA expression data using the heatmap.2 function from the R/Bioconductor package gplots (version 3.0.1.1). We performed a hierarchical clustering of the libraries with complete linkage using an euclidean distance measure.2.8. Differential expression analysisUtilizing the WT libraries as control samples, we performed a differential expression (DE) analysis of endo-siRNAs raw read counts for each RNAi library. The R/Bioconductor package DESeq2 (version 1.18.1)26 was used to perform the DE analysis. We filtered for differentially expressed endo-siRNAs with a Benjamini–Hochberg’s27 multiple testing corrected P-value <0.05 and subjected them for downstream analyses. For the DE analysis of mRNAs, we subjected the raw read counts obtained from HTSeq (version 0.9.0)28 to the DESeq2 package and used the same cutoffs as for siRNAs.2.9. Off-target analysisWe created all possible 23-mers from the feeding regions of both ND169 and DCR1 genes, as well as their reverse complement 23-mers. We aligned these 23-mers against the rest of the P. tetraurelia MAC genome (version 2; stock 51). The bowtie223 aligner was used to perform local alignments (- -local) and report up to 100 distinct alignments for each read (-k 100). Further, we identified the genes overlapping with a unique exact match from these alignments.2.10. GO enrichment analysisWe performed gene ontology (GO) enrichment analysis using Ontologizer (version 2.0).29 We utilized the default options of the Ontologizer tool except for setting the options to Benjamini–Hochberg method for multiple testing corrections. GO terms with a corrected P-value < 0.05 are considered statistically significant. All Paramecium genes were used as the population set.3. Results and discussion3.1. Analysis of feeding associated siRNAs of DCR1 and ND169Two genes were silenced by RNAi and this was carried out at two different transcriptomic backgrounds (serotypes) at 31°C for cells expressing serotype 51A and at 24°C for cells expressing serotype 51B. We have chosen DCR1 as it was shown to be involved in transgene-induced silencing as well as dsRNA feeding, which both accumulate 23 nt siRNAs.14,20 23 nt is also the pre-dominant length of endo-siRNAs.16 As a control, we used dsRNA feeding against a gene involved in trichocyst discharge (ND169), which has no known relation with siRNA accumulation.After RNA isolation and sequencing, we first analysed the siRNAs associated with dsRNA feeding. Fig. 1A–D shows coverage plots of the two feeding genes. We can observe the accumulation of primary siRNAs in the feeding regions and a significantly lower amount of secondary siRNAs outside this region. We can confirm that these siRNAs are an effect of feeding, as the siRNAs of these two feeding genes in WT serotypes have low coverage (Supplementary Fig. S1). As the coverage plots represent raw reads, the bar plot in Fig. 1E shows normalized data for the feeding associated siRNAs. DCR1 feeding shows a lower amount of siRNAs compared with ND169 feeding. As DCR1 has been shown to be involved in the feeding pathway,13,30 silencing of DCR1 by feeding could inhibit its own silencing. This form of recursive RNAi could be the reason why we observe lower abundance of primary siRNAs in DCR1 feeding. However, Fig. 1F shows the knockdown efficiency of the target genes by displaying the reduction in fold changes. Both, DCR1 and ND169 silencing lead to mRNA reduction greater than 95%, with DCR1 silencing being particularly efficient.3.2. Endogenous siRNAs in control feeding are not WTWe next analysed the endo-siRNAs of the feeding cultures and compared them to WT cells of the respective serotype fed with regular and non-dsRNA producing bacteria. We took advantage of the recently described genome wide analysis of endo-siRNA producing loci in the vegetative genome of P. tetraurelia, which identified 1,618 endo-siRNA loci overlapping with gene annotations in different serotypes in Paramecium.16 To analyse sRNA abundance in these loci for the different feeding experiments, we normalized the read data using the KDCS method implemented in the RAPID pipeline.22 The KDCS method scales the read counts of each endo-siRNA in a library to the library with highest read counts, after eliminating the feeding associated siRNAs which are usually highly abundant (see Materials and methods). We utilized these normalized read counts of the endo-siRNA loci of all libraries to investigate the clustering pattern of replicates, specific to each serotype (Fig. 2A and B). We noted that WT samples clearly separated from all feeding cultures. It is surprising as the ND169 gene is thought not to be involved in siRNA pathways, we expected ND169 feeding replicates to cluster with WT replicates. We note that WT and feeding cultures differ in the bacterial strains used as food (K. planticola and E. coli, respectively). However, as both belong to the Enterobacteriaceae family and as Paramecium shows almost identical division rates (data not shown), it is unlikely that differences in the observed siRNA composition are due to the food bacteria.Heatmap of normalized sRNA read counts after hierarchical clustering (Euclidean distance measure) of the 1,618 endo-siRNAs (rows) for all replicates (columns) respective to the serotype 51A (A) and 51B (B) is shown.Heatmap of normalized sRNA read counts after hierarchical clustering (Euclidean distance measure) of the 1,618 endo-siRNAs (rows) for all replicates (columns) respective to the serotype 51A (A) and 51B (B) is shown.To get more insight into the differences of end-siRNAs we investigated their abundance distribution. Figure 3A and B shows boxplots visualizing the abundance of endo-siRNAs in all experiments for the two serotypes (replicates were merged). A statistically significant reduction (Wilcoxon test P-value < 0.05) of siRNA abundance is apparent in each feeding culture compared with the WTs without dsRNA diet. In both serotypes, the endo-siRNA accumulation pattern indicates ND169 feeding to be closer to DCR1 silencing than to WTs suggesting that ND169 silencing does not solely affect the ND169 mRNA.Quantification and differential expression of the 1,618 endo-siRNAs.

(C and D) Set intersection plots of differentially expressed endo-siRNA clusters in the knockdown libraries against each wild-type library for 51A, and 51B, respectively.We performed a DE analysis of the endo-siRNAs between the WT and the feeding samples. Figure 3C and D shows a set intersection plot (UpSetR plot31) of the significantly differentially expressed endo-siRNAs (see Materials and methods; Supplementary Table S1), for the two serotypes 51A and 51B, respectively. In serotypes 51A and 51B, the DCR1 feeding samples have 371 and 367 differentially expressed endo-siRNAs, respectively. Of them approximately 70% of the endo-siRNAs (257 in 51A and 254 in 51B) are differentially expressed in ND169 feeding as well, which suggest a common response to exo-dsRNA.We performed a GO enrichment analysis, using the Ontologizer software, to investigate whether genes associated with the differentially expressed endo-siRNAs have any over-represented GO terms (Supplementary Table S1). We identified diverse functions and processes associated with these genes. Following are some of the significantly enriched terms: cofactor metabolic process, Pteridine-containing compound metabolic process, single-multicellular organism process, multicellular organism process, developmental process, and others. These results suggest that feeding interferes with a diverse set of pathways irrespective of the feeding gene.Our results are the first evidence that application of exo-dsRNA alters endo-siRNA accumulation at large scale in Paramecium. One reason could be that exo-dsRNA could have off-targets. We discuss these off-targets in relation with gene expression in the next section. Another reason could be that the massive amounts of exo-dsRNA saturate molecular components of the feeding pathway. Hence, those components which are additionally involved in endogenous regulation of gene expression have lower capacity for their endogenous role. This implies that cell cultures undergoing dsRNA feeding should not be considered WT, at least on the siRNA level.3.3. Feeding of dsRNA causes de-regulation of gene expressionDue to the loss of endo-siRNAs in all feeding experiments, we investigated whether this is accompanied by changes in gene expression. We prepared poly-A enriched libraries for WT and RNAi against two genes, DCR1 and as control ND169. The mRNA libraries of RNAi samples were generated from the respective biological sample used for sRNA libraries. We quantified the gene expression of all the annotated genes of P. tetraurelia using the Salmon software (see Materials and methods). For each serotype, we created a heatmap of the gene expression values (Fig. 4A and B) showing the clustering of replicates. We can observe that WT samples cluster separately in both serotypes. Similar to the analysis of siRNAs (Fig. 2A and B), we observe that there are large changes in the mRNA transcriptome after ND169 and DCR1 feeding. However, the ND169 feeding replicates (except one replicate in serotype 51A) are relatively closer to the WT replicates than what we observed in endo-siRNA accumulation, according to our clustering analysis.Heatmap of mRNA expression after hierarchical clustering (Euclidean distance measure) of all the mRNAs (rows) for all replicates (columns) respective to the serotype 51A (A) and 51B (B) is shown.Heatmap of mRNA expression after hierarchical clustering (Euclidean distance measure) of all the mRNAs (rows) for all replicates (columns) respective to the serotype 51A (A) and 51B (B) is shown.To analyse the differences in mRNA expression in more detail, we first checked the distribution of gene expression (mean of the replicates), visualizing them as boxplots shown in Fig. 5A and B. We observe a statistically significant reduction in the gene expression in the feeding experiments in both serotypes (Wilcoxon test P-value < 0.05). However, unlike the endo-siRNA accumulation (Fig. 3A and B), we can observe a statistically significant difference between the ND169 control feeding and the DCR1 feeding as well in both serotypes. This asserts the observed clustering pattern in Fig. 4. Albeit observing a rather equal amount of endo-siRNA loss in both feeding samples, the loss in mRNA is different among them, with stronger reduction of mRNA expression in DCR1 feeding. One possibility for this behaviour is that many of the produced endo-siRNAs are either spurious or cis inactive Dicer products. It is unclear whether these spurious or cis inactive Dicer products have a different regulatory capacity. However, our earlier work has shown that endo-siRNAs do not cause cis silencing effects, for many loci.16(A and B) Boxplots of genome-wide mRNA expression (y-axis; TPM) of serotype (51A and 51B, respectively) and their knockdowns (ND169 and DCR1).

(C and D) Set intersection plots of differentially expressed (D.E.) mRNA in the knockdown libraries against each wild-type library for 51A, and 51B, respectively.Subsequently, we performed differential gene expression analysis between the WT, and feeding samples (see Materials and methods; Supplementary Table S1). Figure 5C and D shows set intersection plots of the significantly differentially expressed genes (see Materials and methods) for serotypes 51A and 51B, respectively. In both serotypes, DCR1 feeding has the highest and unique set of differentially expressed genes. However, approximately 30–40% of the differentially expressed genes in DCR1 are commonly found in the ND169 control feeding as well. It seems likely that genes, which are uniquely differentially expressed in DCR1, are due to direct effects of DCR1 being involved in endo-siRNA accumulation. In contrast, commonly differentially expressed genes are probably de-regulated as a response to the feeding process rather than the causal effect of the knocked-down gene. Supplementary Fig. S2 shows the MA plots of the up and down-regulated genes in each feeding sample against the WT serotype.GO enrichment analysis of these commonly differentially expressed genes reveals diverse sets of biological processes such as nucleoside phosphate metabolic process, gene expression, biosynthetic processes, ATPase activity, and proteolysis. These results indicate that feeding affects a diverse set of pathways, which seem to be involved in the general depletion of endo-siRNAs and mRNAs that we observe.3.4. Could direct off-target effects cause transcriptomic changes?Another possibility would be that the feeding constructs we used have unintended off-targets triggering a cascade of transcriptomic alterations. We created all possible 23 bp sub-sequences of the feeding-region (see Materials and methods) and aligned them to the rest of the genome. We found five and two exact matching off-target genes for ND169 and DCR1 feeding regions, respectively. The DE status of these genes in the respective library is shown in Supplementary Table S1. Only some of the off-targets are differentially expressed in some of the libraries. With these data we can cautiously conclude that the large number of differentially expressed genes are unlikely to be an off-target effect, but a general response to the massive dsRNA feeding. We want to exercise caution in interpreting this off-target analysis, because a study on Drosophila shows that the sRNA fit to the target must not be over the full length. The Piwi Aubergine targets RNA for slicing with complementarity to the loaded sRNA only from nucleotides 2-16.32 Of course, the shorter the complementary sequence, the more off-target effects could occur. Although, it is unlikely as this would cause a massive cross silencing in the transcriptome, especially if we include 2° siRNAs in this scenario. However, in our off-target analysis we do not observe any 2-16 nt alignments.In our case one of the most likely explanations seems to be an overload of RNAi components by exo-dsRNA, which will then have less capacity for their function in endo-siRNA biogenesis. In addition, we do not see strong regulation of RNAi components in feeding conditions, which could contribute to altered siRNA accumulation. Supplementary Fig. S3 shows the regulation of RNAi components of Paramecium and most of them show indeed a slight down-regulation similar to the entire transcriptome. Among several up and down-regulated RNAi components, the only known feeding component showing a slight up-regulation is RDR2, an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. RDR2 is known to be involved in feeding and endo-siRNA accumulation.15,16.Our data about feeding mechanisms in Paramecium document the aberrations of endo-siRNAs and transcriptome for the first time, but our current data do not allow us to decide whether off-target effects are sequence dependent or caused by more indirect effects.3.5. Phased endo-siRNAs show alterations in gene expression in cisFurther, we dissected the endo-siRNAs between loci showing phased siRNAs and such without. Phasing is a process, where long dsRNA precursors are cut into equidistant siRNAs by Dicer or Dicer-like enzymes. However, phased siRNAs are not exclusively due to Dicer cleavage. For instance, piRNA/Ago can also cut a ssRNA into phased siRNAs.33 Among the 1,618 endo-siRNA producing loci in the vegetative genome of P. tetraurelia, 81 and 66 endo-siRNA loci were characterized as phased in serotypes 51A and 51B, respectively.16Figure 6A and B shows the fold change of endo siRNA reads in the feeding sample against the WT. We can observe a statistically significant reduction of phased siRNAs compared with non-phased ones (Wilcoxon test P-value < 0.05) in all samples. In both serotypes, the strongest reduction of phased endo siRNAs can be found in DCR1 silencing. This may fit the involvement of this enzyme in dsRNA feeding and transgene-induced silencing, both of which depend on massive accumulation of phased siRNAs.14,20 As the fold change interpretation (Fig. 6) neglects the absolute abundance, we show in Supplementary Fig. 4 that the abundance of phased endo-siRNAs are higher than the unphased.Dissecting the 1,618 endo-siRNA producing loci depending on their phasing prediction. (A and B) Fold change of the endo-siRNAs read count (y-axis, log2 knockdown/wild type), categorized into phased and unphased loci, is shown for knockdown libraries of serotype 51A, and 51B, respectively.

There were 68, and 48 genes overlapping with the phased endo-siRNAs in serotype 51A and 51B, respectively. Figure 6C and D shows the fold change of mRNA expression in RNAi samples against the WT samples of 51A, and 51B, respectively. We observe a statistically significant difference in mRNA fold changes between the phased and unphased loci in all feeding experiments, except for ND169 feeding in serotype 51B. In other words, genes with unphased endo-siRNAs show reduced expression, whereas many genes with phased endo-siRNAs show more stable mRNA expression compared with WT.In contrast, in our previous work we found that genes overlapping phased endo-siRNA loci showed increased mRNA expression after knockout of RDR2.16 However, we do not observe such an increase in mRNA expression in our feeding experiments. Our data do not allow us to dissect why the loss of endo-siRNA in ND169 feeding of serotype 51B (Fig. 6D) does not cause altered gene expression for phased endo-siRNAs. We do not detect any significant difference neither in sense/antisense bias nor read length distribution (Supplementary Figs 5 and 6).4. ConclusionsIn the past, many studies used RNAi by feeding and also recursive RNAi experiments which were successful in Paramecium, and many other organisms, in the identification of RNAi pathway components. However, usually these approaches used individual reporter genes rather than genome-wide transcriptomic approaches. Our data show that RNAi by feeding causes genome-wide alterations in both the endo-siRNAs and mRNA levels. However, this seems not to be associated with drastic alterations of gene expression at least in cis.Researchers using the feeding technique to study the gene expression caused by RNAi must exercise caution. One must distinguish between the gene expression changes by the genes involved in the feeding pathway and the ones which are merely a response to the feeding technique. The overlap of differentially expressed genes between the control ND169 and DCR1 feeding shown in Fig. 5C and D emphasizes the importance of choosing an appropriate control and using an unrelated gene for silencing seems still the appropriate control whether for a normal knockdown or for recursive RNAi.Our observed endo-siRNA, and mRNA expression changes in Paramecium, due to exo-dsRNA application, complement a recent set of studies that show a large diversity of different off-target effects in other species. Recent evidence reports off-target effects in C. elegans in three different ways including the rescue of mir-35-41 triggered temperature sensitive reduction in progeny viability.34 As we were not able to predict any miRNAs in Paramecium,16 this clearly differs and suggests species-specific off-target effects, which cannot be generalized. A similar study has recently reported that even in mammalian cells a higher overlap between dsRNA induced and miRNA pathways are expected.35 The question remains whether it is true that the high abundance of dsRNA in most feeding approaches is solely responsible for sequence independent off-target effects. It was shown in Paramecium, that even ssRNA from food bacteria (rRNA; mRNA) becomes converted into siRNAs by the feeding pathway.14 One could assume that the food in general, not necessarily dsRNA engineered food, could affect endo-siRNA composition.All of this basic knowledge, which is still fragmented, needs to be considered in biotechnological approaches. An increasing number of studies uses dsRNA produced by bacteria or plants to induce virus resistance or pest-lethality by targeting individual genes on the sequence level. This adds to the discussion whether dsRNA application in the field needs to be considered a genetic manipulation or maybe even an epigenetic manipulation. Usually, RNA-treated organisms are considered GMO-free. Especially in plants, direct application of RNA is very efficient and can be used for trans species silencing of genes in insects, mites and nematodes.36 When introducing massive amounts of RNA in field studies, one should expect more genome-wide effects than those induced by simple homology-dependent silencing of one individual locus.We are grateful to Olivier Arnaiz for help with the new genome annotation, to Gilles Gasparoni for kind assistance with sequencing, to E.

IntroductionThe unusual adult pentameral body plan of echinoderms and how it relates to the bilateral plan of other members of the superphylum Deuterostomia has long been the subject of debate among evolutionary biologists.1–6 This morphology is derived as Cambrian fossils shows that the earliest echinoderms were bilateral as adults.7,8 Although the molecular and cellular mechanisms underlying embryo and larval development in echinoderms are well studied, especially for the sea urchin model,5 the molecular basis of metamorphosis and adult body plan development is poorly understood because of the challenge to rear feeding larvae to the juvenile in most species.9,10 Use of direct developing species that metamorphose soon after gastrulation together with application of sequencing technologies, is proving a powerful approach to address questions regarding the development and evolution of pentamery. The developmental transcriptomes of the sea urchins Heliocidaris erythrogramma and H. tuberculata have revealed differences in the embryonic gene regulatory networks of these direct and indirect developers, respectively, and the molecular changes involved with metamorphosis and development of pentamery.11–15After decades of conjecture, the class relationships within the Echinodermata are now supported to comprise the Asterozoa (Asteroidea, Ophiuroidea), the Echinozoa (Echinoidea, Holothuroidea), and the basal Crinozoa (Fig. 1).16 Although echinoids are a major model system for developmental biology, they have many derived traits with respect to the rest of Echinodermata. Early development in most echinoids is characterized by unequal cleavage with tiers of differently sized blastomeres, while in the other echinoderm classes, cleavage is equal. Sea urchins also have two mesodermal lineages, including skeletogenic and pigment cells that are not present in asteroid larval development. They also have the unique echinopluteus larva and the most radical echinoderm metamorphosis forming the juvenile almost entirely of axial elements (skeleton associated with water vascular system elements) with cohesion between the rays.17 An unusual feature of the Echinoidea is the transversion and inversion of their HOX and ParaHOX clusters18,19 with the former suggested to be related to the evolution of the unique sea urchin skeletal test and body form.6 Asteroids, in comparison, have the ancestral-type echinoderm body with distinct and separate rays as well as having the bipinnaria, the ancestral dipleurula-type larva shared with hemichordates (Fig. 1). In addition, the asteroid HOX and ParaHOX clusters are intact and similar to that of other deuterostomes.20,21 Thus, although the Echinoidea is an impressive group for evolution and development (evo-devo) research,14,22 they are less suitable than the Asteroidea to generate insights into the origins and evolution of pentamery in the Echinodermata.6Echinoderm phylogeny showing class relationships, the Asterozoa (Asteroidea, Ophiuroidea), Echinozoa (Echinoidea, Holothuroidea), and basal Crinozoa and indicative relationship with the Hemichordata and Cephalochordata.

Martinez.Research on the molecular and cellular biology of asteroid development has focused on the embryos and larvae of the asterinid sea star Patiria miniata, a species with indirect development and for which extensive genomic resources are available.23,24 To generate insights into the molecular processes underlying adult asteroid development and its radial body plan, we assembled de novo a reference developmental transcriptome for the closely related asterinid, Parvulastra exigua. This direct developing species forms the juvenile soon after gastrulation providing the opportunity to generate thousands of metamorphosing juveniles within 8–10 days.25,Parvulastra exigua has benthic development with hatching delayed until the advanced brachiolaria stage when these larvae have a well-developed attachment complex (brachia and adhesive disc) to ensure that they remain attached to the substratum.25,26 As for H. erythrogramma, 27–29 the evolution of lecithotrophic development in P. exigua has been the focus of studies of alternative larval life history modes in the Echinodermata.25,30–33We used RNA-seq to determine transcription profiles across development in P. exigua incorporating six developmental stages from gastrula [1-day post-fertilization (dpf)] to the definitive juvenile (21 dpf). The transcriptome was used to explore changes in gene expression during metamorphosis and adult body plan development. Differential expression analysis was used to compare gene expression in the gastrula and larvae and between larva and late metamorphic development of the pentameral adult. Gene ontology (GO) analysis showed that many of the terms enriched in the late metamorphosis stage were related to neural development and signalling. Considering the close relationship between body plan anatomy and central nervous system (CNS) organization,34,35 we investigated the expression profiles of known neurogenesis transcription factors36 over the time course of development. We were interested to determine if there is a suite of adult development-specific neural genes because the adult CNS of P. exigua, as generally the case for sea stars, develops de novo at metamorphosis.37–39 We also explored the spatial expression of some of these genes in the developing CNS and sensory structures. Our developmental RNA-seq analyses captured the changes in gene expression during the metamorphic transition to the pentameral adult body plan and provided a framework to investigate the development and evolution of the unusual echinoderm radial body plan and its deuterostome affinities.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sample collection, RNA preparation, sequencing and microscopyParvulastra exigua were collected near Sydney, Australia. The eggs were obtained by placing dissected ovaries in 10-5 M 1-Methyladenine (Sigma) in filtered sea water (FSW 1.0 µm Millipore) and fertilized using sperm removed from the testes. Three biological replicate cultures were established each using the gametes from multiple parents in completely unique crosses. The embryos and larvae were reared at 20°C as described by Byrne.25 We sampled six developmental stages from each replicate: gastrula (1 dpf), early brachiolaria (3 dpf), hatched brachiolaria with the 5-lobed hydrocele (6 dpf), flexed brachiolaria with the juvenile rudiment region (early metamorphosis) (10 dpf), metamorphic juvenile (12 dpf), and the definitive juvenile (21 dpf) (Fig. 2A–I). The samples were placed in RNAlater (Sigma) and stored frozen at -20°C until use. RNA was extracted using the RNeasy kit (Qiagen). RNA quantity was measured using a NanoDrop and quality was assessed with a BioAnalyzer. Libraries were prepared by Duke Center for Genomic and Computational Biology from 4 µg total RNA per sample using the Illumina Tru-Seq Library Preparation Kit and sequenced on an Illumina Hi-Seq 2000 with 50 bp paired end reads.Parvulastra exigua (live images: A–E; confocal microscope sections: (F–I) including stages used for the developmental transcriptome.

Scale bars = 100 µm.2.2. MicroscopyFor confocal microscopy, specimens were fixed in 2.5% glutaraldehyde (ProSciTech, Australia) in filtered seawater (FSW 1.0 µm Millipore) for 1–2 h, washed in FSW, dehydrated in an ethanol series to 70% (v/v) ethanol in Milli-Q water and stored at 4°C. They were then dehydrated to 100% ethanol and cleared in 2:1 (v/v) benzyl benzoate/benzyl alcohol and mounted in a coverslip-sealed chamber. The specimens, autofluorescent from the glutaraldehyde fixation, were viewed in an Olympus FluoView 1000 laser scanning system (v.1.7.1.0) linked to an Olympus IX81 inverted microscope. They were excited at <U+03BB>ex 633 nm with a helium–neon laser and detected at <U+03BB>em 645–745 nm. Developing stages were also photographed using a DF13 Olympus camera mounted on an Olympus BX60 microscope.2.3. Transcriptome assembly and annotationPaired-end RNA-seq reads were generated on six stages of development in three biological replicates. Adapters and low-quality bases with quality value less than 20 were removed with cutadapt version 1.13.40 Any resulting reads shorter than 40 bases were eliminated from further analysis. Assembly of short reads into putative transcripts was performed with Trinity version 2.4.0.41 Default settings were used to produce the reference transcriptome (N50 = 3,676 bp, range of transcript lengths is 201–36,276 bp). To quantitate the assembled transcripts, RSEM version 1.3.042 was used with the paired-end setting and Bowtie243 was used by RSEM to map the reads to the transcriptome. Transcriptome sequences were annotated using BLASTn v. 2.6.044 to the recently released P. miniata genome version 2.0 gene models (www.echinobase.org/Echinobase/PmAbout, May 2017, date last accessed). A transcript was associated with a gene if the match had an e-value <1 × 10-20. The annotated set of transcripts is represented by significant hits to 23,502 unique P. miniata gene models, which include 7,575 distinct gene descriptions of transcripts within the assembly. A tool to visualize gene expression profiles from gastrula to definitive juvenile was developed and is available at http://shiny.maths.usyd.edu.au/starfishTimecourse/.2.4. Variation in gene expression across the six developmental stagesFor time course analyses, transcript abundance estimates were transformed as log2 (FPKM + 1) to remove the relationship between mean and variance. Gene-level analyses were done by choosing the most variable transcript associated with a particular gene. Principal components analysis of these data was carried out using the prcomp function in R version 3.4.2. The reduced dimension representation of gene abundances was plotted using ‘autoplot’ from the CRAN package ggfortify.452.5. Differential expression and GO analysisPairwise differential expression analyses were carried out between gastrula and hatched brachiolaria as well as hatched brachiolaria and late metamorphosis stages. To compare changes in abundance of each gene between timepoints, the read counts of every contig belonging to a particular gene were summed to the gene-level according to the best significant BLAST hit to P. miniata gene models (www.echinobase.org/Echinobase/PmAbout). At least five read counts in two or more samples per gene was required to be included in the pairwise differential expression analyses. After filtering, 13,358 and 13,333 distinct genes (from the total set of 23,502) remained for the gastrula vs. hatched brachiolaria comparison and the stages and the hatched brachiolaria vs. late metamorphosis comparison, respectively. The edgeR package v3.18.146 was used to perform the differential expression analyses. First, read counts were normalized using the calcNormFactors function in edgeR and estimateDisp function was used to estimate dispersion. Differential expression estimates were computed using the package’s exactTest function for each pairwise comparison. Genes with an absolute log2 fold-change =2 and false-discovery rate =5% were considered significantly differentially abundant between developmental stages (Supplementary data 1). Volcano plots were generated with ggplot2.47GO analysis was undertaken to determine which ‘Biological Processes’ were enriched among the up-regulated genes during metamorphosis and juvenile development. GO annotations were retrieved according to significant contig hits (e-value = 1e-20)48 and compiled with Blast2GO49 (Supplementary data 2). The ‘piano’ R package v1.16.450 was used to test for enrichment of GO terms relating to ‘Biological Processes’ in sets of significantly differentially abundant genes between developmental stages on a background set of all P. miniata genes included in the differential expression analysis. REVIGO51 was used to summarize and visualize enriched GO terms from these analyses.2.6. Neural genesAs the GO analysis showed that many of the terms enriched in late metamorphosis were related to neural development we searched the transcriptome for genes that encode transcription factors known to be involved in neurogenesis in echinoderms and other deuterostomes.11,36,52 We analysed the expression profiles of 40 of these genes following a similar analysis of expression through metamorphosis in H. erythrogramma.11 Expression profiles were analysed using the online Shiny application (See Supplementary Fig. 1). We were particularly interested in identifying examples of increase or decrease and peaks of expression during the pre-metamorphic, metamorphic, and post-metamorphic stages. Expression profiles were plotted with R 3.0.3,53 where coloured dots represent the expression values of the three biological replicates (Supplementary Fig. 1).2.7. Whole mount in situ hybridizationSpatial expression of Pax6, Eya, SoxB, and Otx was investigated using whole mount in situ hybridization (WMISH). Specimens were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde in DEPC-treated FSW, dehydrated through a graded methanol series and stored in 100% methanol at -20°C. cDNA was synthesized using the Superscript III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) and gene-specific primers that were designed based upon sequences obtained from the P. exigua transcriptome. Amplified fragments were cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega) and sequenced to confirmed gene identity. Probes for WMISH were synthesized as described by Byrne et al.38 WMISH followed the methods of Byrne et al.38 with the following amendments. Samples were pre-treated for 30 min in 6% hydrogen peroxide in 100% methanol prior to rehydration. Prior to hybridization, samples were incubated for 5 min in 0.1 M triethanolamine/5 µl/ml acetic anhydride. Probe detection was carried out using NBT/BCIP (Roche) in a detection buffer containing 10% polyvinyl alcohol. Reactions were stopped with several rinses in sterile water. Specimens were then dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, cleared in 1:2 benzyl benzoate/benzoic acid (v/v) and photographed (as above).3. Results3.1. Development of Parvulastra exiguaThe developmental transcriptome time course included six developmental stages of P. exigua: gastrula (1 dpf), early brachiolaria (3 dpf), hatched brachiolaria (6 dpf), early metamorphic brachiolaria (10 dpf), metamorphosing juvenile (12 dpf), and the definitive juvenile (21 dpf) (Fig. 2A–I). This species lays its large eggs on the substratum in adhesive egg masses. The gastrulae and larvae remain within the fertilization envelope until the early brachiolaria larval stage and during this time the left and right coeloms develop (Fig. 2A, B, F, and G). Hatching is delayed until the larval attachment complex allows them to adhere to the substratum (Fig. 2B andC). The larvae have the tripod morphology of benthic sea star larvae with three larval arms equal in length and a hypertrophied attachment disk in the centre (Fig. 2B, C, H, and I). By Day 6, the core of the pentameral body plan, the 5-lobed hydrocoel develops (Fig. 2H andI). During subsequent days the juvenile rudiment develops and becomes evident on external view (Fig. 2D). By 10 dpf the larvae have the oral side of the developing juvenile directed towards the substratum and the adult tube feet are evident externally (Fig. 2D). The larval body is resorbed slowly as metamorphosis proceeds and the juvenile tube feet take over the role of attachment (Fig. 2D). By 21 dpf the definitive juvenile is well established (Fig. 2E).3.2. Variation in gene expression across developmental stagesThe PCA of developmental gene expression across the six stages showed that most of the variation was between the pre-metamorphic stages of development (PC1—62%), whereas only 18% of variation is explained by differences in the metamorphic and post-metamorphic stages (PC2—18%). Thus, PC1 and 2 captured 80% of the total variation within the gene expression dataset. The similarity between the early and late metamorphic and juvenile stages may be due to the prolonged metamorphosis of P. exigua. Variation across the developmental transcriptome distinguished the gastrula expression profile from all other stages (Fig. 3), likely indicative of major morphogenetic processes occurring at this stage of development.Principal component analysis of developmental gene expression across six stages of development in P. exigua. Most variation was between the pre-metamorphic stages (PC1–62%). Only 18% of variation is explained by differences in the metamorphic and post-metamorphic stages (PC2–18%). The PCA distinguishes the gastrula expression profile from all later developmental stages.Principal component analysis of developmental gene expression across six stages of development in P. exigua.

The PCA distinguishes the gastrula expression profile from all later developmental stages.3.3. Differential expressionTo identify which genes had significant changes in expression through P. exigua development, pairwise differential expression analyses were carried out between three stages. We found 2,242 genes with significant differences in expression between gastrula and hatched brachiolaria (Fig. 4A) and 424 genes differentially expressed between hatched brachiolaria and late metamorphosis (Fig. 4A, Supplementary data 1). In terms of both number of genes and magnitude of expression changes, there was far greater differential expression between gastrula and hatched brachiolaria than the later comparison. This result is consistent with the PCA (Fig. 3) in which PC1 clearly separates gastrula from subsequent developmental stages and reflects the key morphogenetic processes that occur during this stage of development. Indeed, among the most enriched GO terms of genes up-regulated at the gastrula stage are ‘RNA splicing’ (P < 4.59e-6) and ‘cell differentiation’ (P < 5.75e-4),Volcano plot of expression changes between (A) gastrula and hatched brachiolaria larva and (B) hatched brachiolaria and late metamorphosis stages. Genes with a log2 fold-change (FC) greater than or equal to 2 and supported by a false-discovery rate (FDR) less than 5% are coloured according to the stage at which they are significantly up-regulated: gastrula (green), hatched brachiolaria (pink), and late metamorphosis (blue).Volcano plot of expression changes between (A) gastrula and hatched brachiolaria larva and (B) hatched brachiolaria and late metamorphosis stages.

Among the most enriched GO biological processes of genes significantly more abundant at late metamorphosis are terms relating to neural development and signalling (Fig. 5, Supplementary data 2). Other GO categories were related to transcription, cell signalling, and ion transport. Expression relating to these biological processes is consistent with development of the CNS and juvenile sensory structures between these two stages of development.Multidimensional scaling plot of semantic similarity matrix generated from the top 30 enriched GO ‘Biological Process’ terms from genes significantly up-regulated during late metamorphosis relative to the hatched brachiolaria (larval) stage.

Temporal expression of neurogenesis transcription factors over developmentThe temporal expression profiles across the six developmental time points for 40 genes known to be involved in neurogenesis are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. Specific genes involved in neurogenesis including BarH1, Mbx, Gsx, Otp, FoxB, FoxD, Pax6, Hey, NeuroD, Ngn, and Hnf6 (see 36,52) are among the 311 genes more abundant during late metamorphosis. Although expression varied with respect to patterns of up-regulation or down-regulation over the time course of development, a few distinct profiles were evident (Fig. 6, Supplementary Fig. 1).Temporal expression profiles in P. exigua of putative neurogenic genes in three profiles, (A) Post-gastrula decrease, (B) up-regulation between gastrulation and the early larval stages followed by a decrease and an up-regulation at metamorphosis and juvenile stages, and (C) low expression in pre-metamorphic stages followed by an up-regulation during metamorphosis. The Fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped read (FPKM), log transformed, were plotted for the six developmental stages (see Supplementary Fig. 1).Temporal expression profiles in P. exigua of putative neurogenic genes in three profiles, (A) Post-gastrula decrease, (B) up-regulation between gastrulation and the early larval stages followed by a decrease and an up-regulation at metamorphosis and juvenile stages, and (C) low expression in pre-metamorphic stages followed by an up-regulation during metamorphosis. The Fragments per kilobase of transcript per million mapped read (FPKM), log transformed, were plotted for the six developmental stages (see Supplementary Fig. 1).A group of important genes (e.g. Otx, Six3/6, Rx, Emx, FoxM, and Dlx) exhibited early up-regulation in the gastrula stage followed by a pre-metamorphic decrease after gastrulation through the larval and metamorphic stages (Fig. 6A). In some of these genes the decrease was not so marked (e.g. Six3/6) and others (e.g. Otx and Dlx) showed some increase in late metamorphosis and the juvenile stages (Fig. 6A).A second striking pattern was seen in up-regulation of expression between gastrulation and the early larva followed by a decline and then by increased expression through metamorphosis and juvenile stages (Fig. 6B). This was seen for Pax6, Otp, FoxD, Eya, and Hey, among others (Fig. 6B, Supplementary Fig. 1).In a third pattern, low expression in pre-metamorphic stages (gastrula to hatched brachiolaria) was followed by an up-regulation during metamorphosis (Days 10 and 12) (Fig. 6C). This included FoxB, BarH1, and Mbx (Fig. 6C), A number of genes that showed various expression profiles during pre-metamorphic development had peak expression in the late metamorphosis and/or the juvenile stages, including Nurr1, Isl, Hnf6, Meis, Pou4f2, ebf3, Gad, and Brn1/2/4 (Supplementary Fig. 1).Finally, some genes were transiently up-regulated in the early larval stage e.g. Ngn, Hey, Otp, and FoxD (Supplementary Fig. 1). Nkx2.1 had the highest expression at the gastrula and early brachiolaria stages with down-regulation thereafter (Supplementary Fig. 1).3.5. Spatial expression of neurogenesis genes in the metamorphic juvenileThe asteroid CNS is located on the surface ectoderm (i.e. not covered in skeleton as in other echinoderms) and so spatial gene expression in the radial nerve cord and associated sensory structures (eye spot, tube feet) are evident on surface view. In situ hybridization indicated that the expression domain of Otx became focussed to the CNS (Fig. 7A). Otx has high temporal expression in early embryos (Fig. 6A) and its lower expression in later development indicates down-regulation. However, Otx is strongly expressed in the developing CNS (Fig. 7A). Eya is up-regulated during metamorphosis (Fig. 6B) and its expression domain is also associated with the CNS (Fig. 7B). The temporal expression of Pax6 increases during metamorphosis and in the juvenile (Fig. 6B). This gene is strongly expressed in the eye spot at the end of the radial nerve cord and in the pairs of tube feet (Fig. 7D). SoxB1 is also expressed in the tube feet and eye spot (Fig. 7C). This gene has a uniform high expression through development (Supplementary Fig. 1).In situ hybridization of spatial expression of neurogenic genes in the developing juvenile P. exigua.

DiscussionThe bilateral larva to pentameral juvenile metamorphic transition heralds a distinct phase in gene expression in P. exigua, as also the case for the sea urchin H. erythrogramma,11 and other marine invertebrates that undergo a larva to juvenile metamorphic transition.54. This highlights the distinct larval and adult developmental modules and their likely association with distinct gene regulation. The transcriptomic resources developed here for P. exigua, and previously for H. erythrogramma,11,14 with extensive coverage of the metamorphic stages, provide the basis to investigate changes in gene expression during development of pentamery and to explore deuterostome affinities of the unique echinoderm body plan.The PCA showed that gene expression in the gastrula stage of P. exigua was separate from that in the other stages, as also found for H. erythrogramma.11). This was also reflected in the differential gene expression analysis and may be explained in the regulation of tissue specification and unique morphogenetic processes that occur during gastrulation.55 The PCA also showed that gene expression was less variable across the metamorphic and juvenile stages compared with the pre-metamorphic stages. In contrast, the change in gene expression associated with metamorphosis in H. erythrogramma is more temporally marked.11 This difference may be due to the benthic mode development in P. exigua where metamorphosis is slow (over 5–7days).25 The larvae remain attached as their body degenerates in parallel with development of the adult podia. In H. erythrogramma, the metamorphic transition following settlement of the planktonic larva is much shorter.11 For P. exigua, it was surprising, that gene expression in the older definitive juvenile (21days old) was not more distinct compared with the metamorphic stages (10 and 12days old).We investigated the larva–juvenile transition in GO analysis of differential gene expression between pre-(hatched brachiolaria) and post-metamorphic (late metamorphosis) stages. Differential expression analysis demonstrates an especially pronounced up-regulation in expression of many genes at late metamorphosis relative to hatched brachiolaria in terms of both fold-change magnitude and number of genes (311) (Supplementary Data 1). This result reflects a large transcriptomic shift associated with the life history transition to a benthic juvenile. Many of the GO terms enriched in differentially expressed genes were related to neural development, as also found for H. erythrogramma.11 Many of the genes known to be expressed during development of the sea urchin larval nervous system36 were expressed in P. exigua (Supplementary Fig. 1). High expression of Nkx2.1 in the gastrulae and early larvae of P. exigua is similar to the timing of expression of this gene in development of the feeding larvae in echinoids and asteroids where it is associated with patterning the larval nervous system.56,57 For P. exigua expression of Nkx2.1 in the gastrula and early brachiolaria may be associated with development of the larval nervous system,58 although this system is reduced in the benthic larva of this species. In addition, high expression of Rx and Six3/6 at the gastrula stage is consistent with the stage of expression of these genes in P. miniata where they are involved in establishment of neurogenic territories in the larva.23 For Otx, up-regulation during gastrulation in P. exigua is likely to be due to its conserved function in endoderm development during this embryonic stage in sea stars.59,60There does not appear to be a set of larva or adult specific neural genes in P. exigua, as also for H. erythrogramma.11,15 The bimodal-like pattern of expression with initial up-regulation between gastrula and early larvae followed by a decrease and then up-regulation during metamorphosis and remaining high in the post-metamorphic juvenile was seen many of the neural transcription factor genes. This indicates roles for these genes in embryogenesis and juvenile development.We expected that renewal of neurogenesis as the adult nervous system develops during metamorphosis38 would be associated with up-regulation of neural transcription factors. Indeed, for P. exigua, a suite of neural genes was more richly expressed during metamorphosis and post-metamorphosis. The P. exigua and H. erythrogramma transcriptomes provide an opportunity for an asteroid–echinoid comparison with respect to genes that may be involved with CNS development as well as patterning the pentameral body, as these processes occur simultaneously. In H. erythrogramma genes that peak during rudiment development include SoxC, Barh1, Hnf6, Sp8, and Meis and those that peak after metamorphosis in the juvenile include Mbx, Isl, Nurr1, Pou4f, and Otp.11 These genes exhibited a similar expression pattern in P. exigua but were more spread across the rudiment and juveniles stages, likely due to the gradual metamorphosis of this species. Thus, despite the ~500 million-yr-old asteroid–echinoid divergence from a common ancestor, there is strong conservation in expression of neural transcription factors in metamorphosis and juvenile development. This indicates the essential roles of these genes during these life history stages, a suggestion that needs to be addressed through functional studies. It will be of interest to compare the expression of neural transcription factors in the adult asteroid and echinoid from biological and functional perspectives and their differential expression with respect to body plan and neurogenesis.As CNS morphogenesis parallels the development of pentamery, exploring potential links between these two will be informative. In P. exigua, Hox4, a gene deleted from the sea urchin HOX cluster, is expressed in the hydrocoel lobes in the larva and in the developing CNS post-metamorphosis, as is Engrailed.38,61 We show here that Otx and Eya, and previously,38 that Eng are also expressed in the developing CNS of this species. In H. erythrogramma Six1/2 is expressed in the hydrocoel lobes and in the developing CNS and other putative neurogenic genes (e.g. Eya, Tbx2/3, and Msx) are also expressed in hydrocoel development.15,Pax6, Otx, and Six3/6 are expressed in the developing sea urchin CNS.13,62–64 The spatial expression domain of Otx is focussed on the CNS during metamorphosis. This shows the importance of determining the spatial expression of transcription factor genes which otherwise appear to be down-regulated in transcriptome analysis, as noted for retinal determination genes in sea urchin development.13In P. exigua, Pax6 is strongly expressed in the eye spot at the tip of the radial nerve cord where it ends at the primary podium and in the tube feet, structures that are considered to be photosensory.13,65 This is consistent with expression of Pax6 in photosensory structures in diverse species.66,67 In H. erythrogramma and other sea urchins Pax6 is expressed in the primary podia and tube feet.13,65While most research on echinoderm neurogenesis has focussed on the larval nervous system, with many fundamental advances and discoveries made,23,52,68 this structure is not considered to be relevant to discussions on relationships with the chordate nervous system.69 Although adult echinoderms are not cephalized, their CNS has many structural similarities with the chordate nerve cord.70–72 For example, the oral nerve ring and radial nerve cord have a neuroepithelium containing nerve cell bodies and an axonal neuropil with glial cells, analogous to the grey and white matter of the vertebrate spinal cord, respectively.71,73 With respect to spatial expression of neural genes, the open ambulacral system of the Asteroidea with the CNS in the surface ectoderm is particularly amenable to compare cell and tissue level molecular biology of the echinoderm nervous system with that of the chordates.As basal deuterostomes, echinoderms are in a phylogenetic position key to understanding evolutionary origins of the chordate nervous system. The timing of expression of many neural transcription factors coincided with CNS development indicating conserved roles in nerve cord patterning. However, their location of expression and function in adult echinoderm neurogenesis remain to be determined. It appears that a focus on the molecular mechanisms underlying development of the adult echinoderm CNS will be informative with respect to determining chordate affinities.The echinoid–asteroid comparisons made here, based on temporal expression patterns in developmental transcriptome analysis are only indicative, but the genomic resources for P. exigua (this study) and H. erythrogramma11,14 provide the tools to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying development of the adult echinoderm and its unusual pentameral body plan in basal (Asteroidea) and more derived (Echinoidea) classes. In addition, the ability to readily generate 1000s of metamorphic and juvenile stages of these direct developing species presents a unique model system for detailed spatial studies of gene expression in the development of pentamery and the biological processes underlying echinoderm–deuterostome affinities and evolution.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at DNARES online.Thanks to L.
