We believe that our journal has not only satisfied the original goals of its publication, but has exceeded our expectations, as evidenced by the fact that quite a large number of highly cited papers on genomic and other related biological resources have appeared in DNA Research (2006 Impact Factor was 3.066).In the last decade, huge amounts of genomic sequence data have been gathered/deposited and stored in various sequence databases. Technologies allowing the accumulation and interpretation of data, particularly those involving computer software, have seen great advances. Some might say that the data accumulated to date are sufficient enough to cover every conceivable area of research as far as genomics is concerned. We believe, however, that there are still several fields of research where the current sequence data cannot be fully exploited and more pertinent information is urgently needed. One such area is of comparative studies of accumulated genomic data. For example, it is well known that the functions of a majority of the genes of many organisms, predicted from sequence data, cannot be clearly defined because similar sequences with known functions cannot be found in the databases. We therefore feel strongly that the genomic analysis of many more organisms is still needed and that the role of our journal to promote publication of genomic data has not been diminished.At the editorial board of DNA Research, we feel it is equally important to promote publication of papers concerning newly developing technologies for more advanced analysis of genomic data from various perspectives. Furthermore, we would like to encourage researchers to submit papers exploring alternative approaches in genomics, which may complement some of the more conventional genome analyses of individual organisms. Metagenomic analysis of a mixed population of organisms in various habitats is one example of such an approach. We envision and sincerely hope that this type of research will continue in years to come, and will be very much welcome to our journal.In January 2006, Oxford University Press became the publisher of DNA Research. Our journal is currently one of the ‘open access’ journals in which all published papers are freely accessible by readers and we ask the submitting authors of papers to pay a charge for its publication. At the same time, an online submission/administration system (Scholar One) was introduced to speed up and to make transparent the process of submission, editorial handling, and publication of papers.In 2008, in order to attract and encourage more people to read DNA Research and to submit papers of superior quality, we introduced the following measures:
We sincerely hope that these measures will be accepted favorably by the scientific community of DNA/genome research and related disciplines as we continue our service into the future with our determination to publish manuscripts ever more rapidly.Invitation of editors from foreign countries to the editorial board.Introduction of a new section ‘Current Status and Perspectives’ which deals with reviews on specific topics.Broadening of the scope of the journal in response to the expansion as well as fusion of genomics with other research fields.Updating of the design of the journal's cover."

IntroductionGene expression in metazoans is regulated at many levels. Regulation of transcription is the first step in the cascade of regulation and is thus of great importance for our understanding of gene expression. Regulation of transcription is determined by the binding of transcription factors (TFs) to their corresponding TF binding sites (TFBSs), and regulatory sequences containing similar sets of TFBSs are expected to be under the control of similar sets of TFs and drive similar expression patterns. Hence, the identification of TFBSs has become a key factor in unraveling the transcriptional regulation mystery. Unfortunately, the identification of these cis-regulatory elements by wet-lab experiments is time-consuming and labor-intensive. Computational methods have come to the rescue, but both their sensitivity and selectivity are severely hampered by the nature of the target motifs: TFBSs tend to be short (typically six to 15 bp) and degenerate, while the sequence in which they are located can be over 10 kb in length. Looking only at the oligonucleotide sequence recognized by a TF, we can expect a number of biologically meaningless occurrences in almost every promoter sequence. The most popular way of modeling TFBSs is by position weight matrices.1 However, this assumes that the positions within the motifs contribute to the binding affinity in an independent manner. Recent experimental evidence has shown that this assumption is not accurate, and a number of models incorporating position-dependencies have been proposed.2–6There is growing evidence that TFs do not work alone, but rather cooperate to confer a specific spatio-temporal expression pattern; for instance, TFs bind to sites located in close proximity to each other, the so-called cis-regulatory modules (CRMs). It is, therefore, not surprising that many approaches to improve the accuracy of tissue expression prediction have focused on clustered groups of predicted binding sites.7–14 Zhao et al., for example, predicted regulatory modules in Caenorhabditis elegans based on the clustering of a set of motifs correlating with muscle-specific gene expression. Clusters are defined simply as sites of the motifs positioned within a certain distance from each other. Blanchette et al. described a more complex approach where large numbers of PWMs are used to find statistically significant clusters of phylogenetically conserved sites in windows of 100 to 2000 bp. However, focusing only on clustered groups of predicted binding sites might be too simplistic an approach to the problem of TFBS detection and regulatory region architecture modeling. First, most of these approaches do not take into account solitary sites at all, even though some of them are likely to be functional. Secondly, in many CRM-modeling approaches, additional features of TFBSs, such as orientation, positional bias with respect to the transcription or translation start site, and order are ignored, although a number of studies have illustrated the importance of these features for some TFBSs.15–17 In a genome-wide analysis of TFBSs in the mouse genome, Sharov et al. found that a considerable number of TFBSs showed a significant bias in their orientation. Berendzen et al. studied the importance of position and orientation of cis-regulatory elements and promoter motifs in a number of species. Their results show that several known functional elements appear to be relatively enriched at defined sites in the promoter region. Terai and Takagi showed that it is possible to find motif combinations in yeast that are significantly associated with a certain expression profile if their order is restricted, whereas they are not associated if their order is not taken into account. Methods that have tried to use such features are few in number. The Dragon Promoter Mapper uses a number of motif features such as the orientation, the order, and distances between adjacent motifs.18 However, the distance to the transcription or translation start site is not taken into account, and the model might have difficulties with motifs that lack a conserved distance between their sites showing a general preference for a certain region within the promoter region. Methods as the one described by Ohler et al. use more diverse physical properties such as DNA bendability, GC content, or stacking energy in addition to predicted TATA-boxes and initiator sites.19 These methods, however, need hundreds of training sequences and focus only on the core promoter region, where the distances between functional elements are strongly conserved. In addition, the final goal of these programs is fundamentally different from ours. While we predict the promoters with a similar architecture as an input set of promoters, they merely predict the presence or absence of a promoter.We introduce here a simple Markov chain-based promoter architecture model as an alternative to the existing CRM models. Our model is trained using an input set of promoter sequences and captures information about the orientation, the positional bias, and the order of predicted occurrences of motifs that are over-represented in the input sequences. Subsequently, the trained model is used to predict genes having similar expression patterns.We applied our model to two promoter sequence datasets: a set of promoter sequences driving expression in pharyngeal muscle cells in C. elegans and a set of muscle-specific promoters in Ciona intestinalis. The muscle system of C. elegans has been extensively studied, and the regulatory regions and expression patterns of a number of genes are relatively well known. C. intestinalis is a chordate model organism that has shown to be very useful for the study of developmental and evolutionary biology, and recently a number of studies have focused on the transcriptional regulation of muscle-specific genes in this organism.20–23 The availability of relatively well-annotated expression information for C. elegans and the recent interest in the Ciona muscle regulatory system have determined the choice of our datasets. For both sets we trained the model and used it to predict new candidate promoters with similar expression patterns as the input promoter sequences. Finally, our predictions were verified for their accuracy, using both available annotation data and new wet-lab experiments.2. Methods2.1. Selection of input sequence datasetsThe genomic set of C. elegans promoter sequences was obtained from WormMart (http://www.wormbase.org/, WormBase Release WS170). For each transcript, the 3000 bp upstream of the translation start site were downloaded, and overlapping upstream open reading frames (ORFs) were removed. Finally, repeats were masked using RepeatMasker (version 3.0; http://www.repeatmasker.org).24 A set of 20 promoters, reported on WormBase to drive expression in pharyngeal muscle cells in C. elegans, was selected as input data for the C. elegans pharyngeal muscle model (see Supplementary Material Section 1).For C. intestinalis, the genomic set of promoters was obtained from BioMart (Release JGI2).25 For each transcript, the 3000 bp upstream of the translation start site were downloaded, overlapping upstream ORFs removed, and repeats masked. The promoter sequences of 19 genes previously shown to be expressed in muscle were used to construct the input promoter data set (see Supplementary Material Section 1).2.2. Identification of useful over-represented motifsOver-represented motifs were predicted in each input dataset using the motif-finding programs, MEME,26 Weeder,27 and AlignACE.28 In order not to overlook any significant motifs, different runs on different regions of the input promoter sequences were done, for both strands as well as for single strands (see Supplementary Material Section 2). Finally, only motifs having a length between 6 and 15 bp and having more than five predicted occurrences in their input dataset were considered. Motifs that were obvious repeats (AT-repeats, AT-rich stretches, etc.) were removed. We further removed redundant motifs and selected up to 10 motifs that showed to be the most significantly over-represented in the input promoter sequences. This final set of motifs for each set of input promoter sequences was then used for further analysis and to construct the promoter architecture model.To model the binding site preferences of each motif, we used a variable-order Bayesian network (VOBN), based on a method described previously.29 Basically, a VOBN model can be regarded as a PWM, with the only difference that a first-order dependency between positions in the motif is allowed. In this study, we have set the conditions for introducing a dependency very strict. Because of this, the majority of positions in the VOBN are of zero-th order, which implies that many motifs are basically modeled as PWMs. Only in cases where a strong dependency was found, a first-order dependency between the positions was introduced (see Supplementary Material Section 3). To model the background nucleotide frequencies of the promoter sequences, both for C. elegans and for C. intestinalis, an interpolated Markov model (IMM) was trained from the genomic set of promoter sequences of each organism. This was done using the procedure described by Salzberg et al.30 The IMM we used here is at most of eighth order. However, in cases where training data is scarce, an interpolation is made with a lower order. Thus the IMM takes advantage of the greater accuracy of higher-order models and, at the same time, avoids the problem of over-fitting caused by insufficient training data.2.3. Positional bias and promoter sequence partitioningUsing the final set of motifs, for each dataset we scanned the input sequences for occurrences of each motif and represented them visually. As is discussed in the Results and discussion section, in many cases the occurrences of a motif show a certain tendency to appear in a certain region of the promoter sequences. Often, this is the region proximal to the transcription or translational start site; in other cases, it is a region further upstream. Keeping this heterogeneity in mind, it would be unwise to make one single model for the entire promoter structure, not taking into consideration the positional bias of some motifs.2.4.

The arrow on the right indicates the translation or transcription start site. The squares represent predicted TFBSs for motifs A, B, and C, with ‘ + ’ and ‘ − ’ indicating their orientation. The promoter sequence is divided into a proximal and a distal region with the boundary between these regions, here set at −500 bp. (B) and (C) A visual representation of the promoter model during the scoring process of the distal region and the proximal region, respectively. The states of the model are shown as circles. Each of the two regions has a ‘start’ and a ‘stop’ state, in addition to states for each motif type in both orientations. To score the sequence shown in (A), in the proximal region of the promoter a transition is made from ‘start’ to ‘C+’, from ‘C+’ to ‘A−’, from ‘A−’ to ‘A−’ and finally from ‘A−’ to ‘stop’, corresponding to the TFBSs predicted in the proximal region of the promoter. The score of the proximal region is the sum of the LLR values associated with each of these transitions (e.g. LLRproximal(C+ | start) for the transition from ‘start’ to ‘C+’, etc.). This process is repeated for the distal part of the promoter, and the final score of the promoter is the sum of the scores of both regions.A visual representation of the scoring process of the Markov chain-based promoter structure model.

The score of the proximal region is the sum of the LLR values associated with each of these transitions (e.g. LLRproximal(C+ | start) for the transition from ‘start’ to ‘C+’, etc.). This process is repeated for the distal part of the promoter, and the final score of the promoter is the sum of the scores of both regions.As indicated above, the transitions between motifs that are more characteristic for input promoter sequences will have a high positive score, whereas transitions between motifs that are more characteristic for non-input promoter sequences will have a high negative score. Thus, promoters having similar sets of motifs as the input sequences, with similar orientations and orders as those of the input sequences, in the same region get a high positive score. High-scoring promoters have a structure similar to the input promoters and are, hence, assumed to drive similar expressions. As can be seen from Equation 4, the individual strength of predicted motif sites does not contribute to the score of a sequence.2.6. In situ hybridization experimentsMature adults of C. intestinalis were collected from harbors in Murotsu, Hyogo, Japan, and maintained in indoor tanks of artificial seawater at 18°C. Larvae were obtained as described previously20 and fixed overnight in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.5 M NaCl, 0.1 M, pH 7.5, 3-(N-morpholino) propanesulfonic acid (MOPS) buffer prior to storage in 80% ethanol at −30°C. As the template to synthesize digoxigenin-labeled antisense RNA probes, cDNA clones were obtained from C. intestinalis Gene Collection Release 1.31 The RNA probes were synthesized using a DIG RNA labeling kit (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN). In situ hybridization of whole-mount specimens was carried out as described previously.32 The larvae were mounted in 50% glycerol containing 2% 1,4-diazabicyclo-2,2,2-octane (DABCO) and observed under a confocal microscope LSM 510 (Zeiss).3. Results and discussion3.1. C. elegans pharyngeal muscle promoter architecture modelIn a set of 20 promoter sequences reported to drive expression in pharyngeal muscle cells of C. elegans, we predicted over-represented motifs (see Section 2). Table 1 shows the positional bias score of the found motifs, together with the 300 bp window in the input promoter sequences where the occurrences of each motif are the most abundant. None of these motifs showed a significant similarity to motifs in the JASPAR database.33 Note that some motifs (Cel_PM4, Cel_PM7) show a considerable bias in their orientation. Given that the motifs with the most significant positional bias seem to prefer the region roughly between the translation start site and −1000 bp, we divided the promoter region into a proximal region (from the translation start site to −1000) and a more distal region (from −1000 to the 5′ end of the promoter sequence). Next, for both regions, a first-order Markov chain was trained taking into account the orientation of the motif occurrences as described (see Methods and Supplementary Material Section 4).The seven motifs used in the C. elegans pharyngeal muscle promoter model, with their consensus sequenceThe third and fourth columns show the positional bias score of each motif and the positions of the densest window relative to the translation start site, respectively. The fifth column shows the number of predicted sites in the input promoters on each strand and the ratio of sites in the ‘plus’ orientation.The seven motifs used in the C. elegans pharyngeal muscle promoter model, with their consensus sequenceThe third and fourth columns show the positional bias score of each motif and the positions of the densest window relative to the translation start site, respectively. The fifth column shows the number of predicted sites in the input promoters on each strand and the ratio of sites in the ‘plus’ orientation.In a next step, the genome-wide set of promoters of C. elegans was scored by the trained model (see Methods). Of the 20 input promoters, 11 were in the 100 top-scoring sequences (see Supplementary Material Section 5). To verify the validity of this prediction, we used the expression annotation that can be found in WormBase. For the 100 highest scoring non-input genes having a tissue expression annotation (the first one being ranked 30th, the last one 606th out of 24 446 promoters), we determined which tissues were statistically over-represented. We found that the 100 top-scoring annotated non-input genes are enriched for genes expressed in pharyngeal muscles (10 genes, 4.1 expected by chance, P-value = 0.0025) and muscle tissue in general (42 genes, 30.9 expected by chance, P-value = 0.0072). There was also a slight enrichment for genes expressed in motor neurons (7 genes, 2.4 expected by chance, P-value = 0.0110), which are involved in the regulation of muscle contractions. It is not surprising to find the top-scoring genes to be enriched for not only pharyngeal muscle cells, but also muscle tissues in general, as the input genes’ tissue expression patterns were not restricted to only pharyngeal muscle cells but also included other muscle tissues. Table 2 shows the 10 top-scoring annotated non-input genes and their expression annotation as reported on WormBase. Five of these 10 genes are reported to be expressed in muscle tissue, one of them in pharyngeal muscles. In addition, some genes are reported to be expressed in neurons and motor neurons. It is known that muscle genes and neuronal genes share some regulatory elements, and other studies have reported similar observations.13,34The ten highest scoring non-input promoters for the C. elegans pharyngeal muscle promoter model, with their rank, sequence and transcript name and reported expression patternOf these ten promoters five drive expression in one or more muscle tissues, one specifically in pharyngeal muscles.The ten highest scoring non-input promoters for the C. elegans pharyngeal muscle promoter model, with their rank, sequence and transcript name and reported expression patternOf these ten promoters five drive expression in one or more muscle tissues, one specifically in pharyngeal muscles.3.2. C. intestinalis muscle promoter architecture modelWe predicted over-represented motifs in a set of 19 C. intestinalis promoter sequences known to drive expression in C. intestinalis muscle tissue. Table 3 shows the positional bias scores of the detected over-represented motifs. Motif Cin_M1 and motif Cin_M3 have consensus sequences that are highly similar to those of motifs that have been reported before as playing a crucial role in transcriptional regulation of muscle genes in C. intestinalis.20 The binding sites of these motifs show similarity to those of the CREB and Myf (MyoD) TFs, respectively. Note that again in Table 2, some motifs (Cin_M5, Cin_M10) show a considerable bias in their orientation.The ten motifs used in the C. intestinalis muscle promoter model, with their consensus sequence. See the legend of Table 1 for explanations on the meaning of each columnHere the positions of the densest window are given relative to the TATA-box.The ten motifs used in the C. intestinalis muscle promoter model, with their consensus sequence. See the legend of Table 1 for explanations on the meaning of each columnHere the positions of the densest window are given relative to the TATA-box.For this model, predicted TATA-boxes were used as reference points instead of the translational start sites. Sequences in which we could not find a TATA-box within a reasonable distance of the coding region were anchored at the position 100 bp upstream of the translation start site. Given the preference of some motifs for the proximal region, the promoter architecture model was partitioned into a proximal part (from the translation start site to 250 bp upstream of the predicted TATA-box) and a distal part (from 250 bp upstream of the predicted TATA-box until the 5′ end of the promoter sequence). Although our model does not include a direct way to model the clustering of sites, Table 2 illustrates that the proximal part of the promoter model was denser in motif occurrences than the distal part.For both regions, a first-order Markov chain was trained (see Methods and Supplementary Material Section 4). The genomic set of promoter sequences of C. intestinalis was then scored using the trained model. The promoters were ranked by their score and the top-scoring genes selected for further analysis. Of the 19 input promoters, 16 are in the top 100 scoring sequences (see Supplementary Material Section 5). As a verification of the predictions, expression patterns of non-input genes from the top 50 scoring sequences were analyzed experimentally by in situ hybridization. Among the 29 non-input sequences in the top 50 list, three sequences, all of which encode muscle actin, were excluded from the analysis because their muscle-specific nature was obvious. Other two genes, whose expression patterns had been already known, were also excluded. Among the 24 sequences remaining, cDNA clones were available for four predicted sequences in C. intestinalis Gene Collection Release 1,31 and they were used to synthesize RNA probes for the in situ hybridization analysis. The results of these experiments are shown in Fig. 2. For three of the four tested genes, expression was observed in muscle cells in the tail of the C. intestinalis larva.

ConclusionWe have introduced a simple promoter architecture model that uses the positional bias, the orientation bias, and the order of predicted sites of a set of motifs to predict promoter sequences that drive similar expression patterns as the input promoter sequences. As this model does not directly model the clustering of motifs, it can be considered as an alternative to the existing CRM-based models. During the training of the model, only one parameter needs to be set (i.e. the position of the boundary between the regions). We did not use any tissue-specific or organism-specific information in the construction of the model, so we can expect it to be applicable in other tissues and organisms as well. The fact that we could successfully predict expression profiles in two organisms illustrates the general applicability of our approach. Moreover, the motifs we used in the two datasets and described here were based solely on computational predictions, illustrating that this method does not require prior knowledge of the regulatory factors involved and their binding sites. Apart from a set of promoter sequences of co-regulated genes no other input data are needed. However, the structure of promoters driving expression in other tissues, such as the photoreceptor in C. intestinalis, has shown to be more challenging. Improvements to the model, such as the incorporation of additional information (e.g. the clustering of sites, the distance between pairs of sites, or evolutionary conservation) are likely to improve its prediction performance and are now being studied.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from JSPS (17310114) and was supported in part by another grant (18370089) and by BIRD of Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST).

Most PPIs detected in this study are novel interactions revealing potential functional relationships between genes for symbiotic nitrogen fixation and signal transduction. Furthermore, we have predicted the putative functions of unannotated proteins through their interactions with known proteins. The results described here represent new insight into protein network of M. loti and provide useful experimental clues to elucidate the biological function of rhizobial genes that can not be assigned directly from their genomic sequence.1. IntroductionBacteria belonging to the family Rhizobiaceae (rhizobia) are biologically unique organisms that exhibit two distinct lifestyles in nature, as free-living soil bacteria or as symbionts of some leguminous plants. In nitrogen-starved soil, rhizobia can colonize the roots of compatible legumes and elicit the formation of specialized organ, the root nodules. Inside the nodules, rhizobia differentiate into non-dividing form of bacteria (bacteroid) and reduce atmospheric dinitrogen (N2) into biologically usable ammonia (NH3). Nitrogen fixed by the symbiotic rhizobia is then assimilated by the host plant, enabling the plant to grow in nitrogen-depleted environments.Because of the agronomic importance of rhizobia, complete genome sequencing has been accomplished in seven rhizobia1–6 and is now in progress on several additional species. The availability of complete genome sequences allows us to know the global features of the organism ‘rhizobium’ at the molecular level. Simultaneously, the genome sequences also provide genetic platforms for comparative study of genome structure within rhizobia, or between rhizobia and other plant-associated bacteria. These comparative analyses have revealed the existence of a genomic region enriched for genes involved in symbiotic nitrogen fixation (symbiosis island), as well as various specialized gene sets for signal transduction and membrane transport that allow rhizobia to adapt to the environment of both soil and intracellular of host plant.1,5,7Although a genome sequence is very useful, the genome sequence alone is not sufficient to reveal the specific molecular functions of all the genes. To date, genetic analyses, such as targeted gene disruption or transposon random mutagenesis, have revealed various rhizobial genes essential for nodule formation and nitrogen fixation.6,8 Additionally, with the completion of several rhizobial genome sequences, comprehensive transcriptome or proteome analysis has been carried out in order to understand physiological states of rhizobia under a variety of conditions such as symbiosis with host legume or nutrient-depleted conditions.9–14 These analyses have allowed us to know expressional dynamics throughout the rhizobial genome and to discover numerous novel genes and proteins not previously known to be involved in these conditions.Although a large amount of data have been accumulated through these functional analyses, many genes predicted on the rhizobial genome remain functionally unannotated. That is primarily because that the genome sequence and expression profiles give an indirect and fragmented picture of the biological function of genes, and more detailed information on gene function would be obtained by biochemical properties of the gene products (proteins) or by their interaction with other proteins of known function. Therefore, more interactive and systematic analysis that accelerates functional assignment for many rhizobial genes simultaneously is required.As a first effort to examine the protein networks of rhizobia, we conducted a large-scale analysis of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) in Mesorhizobium loti using a yeast two-hybrid (YTH) system. YTH analysis is one of the well-established methods for mapping binary protein interactions and its usefulness is clearly illustrates by the fact that comprehensive studies of PPIs in several model organisms have provided several important biological and bioinformatics platforms for the study of protein networks in the organism.15–18 These analyses have also successfully placed functionally uncharacterized proteins into their biological context.In this study, for the selection of target gene groups for the YTH screening, we primarily used two available information, the genomic information and the results of a transcriptome analysis of M. loti. Symbiosis island contains many genes for symbiotic nitrogen fixation1 and the clustered up-regulation of genes in symbiosis island under bacteroid state were observed by macroarray analysis of M. loti.14 The macroarray analysis also revealed that several genes located outside of symbiosis island were also up-regulated under bacteroid or microaerobic condition. Although these features led us to hypothesize that genes located in the symbiotic island and those up-regulated under symbiosis are involved in certain physiological events of symbiotic nitrogen fixation, the biological significance of the majority of these genes has not yet been revealed. Identification of PPIs of these gene products will help elucidate their biological function and expand our knowledge of the mechanism of symbiotic nitrogen fixation. Therefore, we selected these genes for the initial target of our analysis. Complete genome sequences of several rhizobium species enables us to survey the conserved orthologous genes among rhizobia. Since conserved genes are presumed to execute common functions, the obtained PPI data from the M. loti YTH screening can be applied to other rhizobia. Among conserved genes, we primarily selected M. loti genes of unknown function and those with regulatory functions, in order to reveal the biological roles of the functionally unannotated proteins and signal transduction pathways that function commonly among rhizobium species.2. Materials and methods2.1. Construction of bait clones and prey libraryThe backbone of our YTH screening is the MATCHMAKER GAL-4 based YTH system. As for bait and prey vectors, we used pAS2-1 and pACT2 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA), respectively, which were modified by introducing the Gateway recombination system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA).19 A Gateway cassette containing the attR recombination site flanking a ccdB gene and a chloramphenicol-resistance gene were ligated into the multicloning site of pAS2-1 and pACT2, and the resultant vectors were designated as pAS-GW and pACT-GW, respectively.For bait clones, target gene fragments were obtained by PCR amplification from cosmid clones or genomic DNA using gene specific primer pairs with CACC sequence added to the forward primer. To minimize potential misincorporation during PCR, the high-fidelity DNA polymerase, Pfu DNA polymerase (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA), was used. Amplified fragments were cloned into the pENTR/D-TOPO vector (Invitrogen) to make entry clones. After confirmation of DNA sequence, the insert of the entry clone was transferred to pAS-GW using LR recombination reaction according to the manufacturer's instructions. The resultant plasmids harboring individual M. loti genes were transformed into yeast AH109 (MATa) (Clontech) and transformants were grown on SD/-Trp plates.We constructed a prey library from a random genomic fragment library. Genomic DNA of M. loti was isolated by the procedure of Chen and Kuo20 with some modifications. Following the sonication of genomic DNA, two size ranges of DNA fragments (0.5–1.2 and 1.2–2.5 kb) were isolated from agarose gels and then cloned individually into DraI/EcoRV site of the pENTR 1A vector (Invitrogen). A pool of plasmids containing each size range of DNA fragments were recovered from 5.3 × 106 (0.5–1.2 kb) and 3.8 × 106 (1.2–2.5 kb) independent Escherichia coli transformants (ElectroMax DH10B competent cells; Invitrogen). The inserts of the recovered plasmids were transferred to the pACT-GW vector via LR recombination, and the resultant plasmids were transformed into the yeast strain Y187 (MATα). A total of 6 × 106 yeast transformants were collected and pooled as the prey library.2.2. Mating-mediated YTH screeningPrior to screening, the self-activity of each bait clone was confirmed by mating with the Y187 strain harboring an empty pACT2 vector and then plating on SD/-His/-Leu/-Trp/ medium supplemented with 2.5, 5, 10, or 50 mM 3-amino 1,2,4-triazole (3-AT). Each bait clone was mated with the prey library containing approximately 3 × 107 independent clones and plated on SD/-His/-Leu/-Trp/ agar medium supplemented with the optimal concentration of 3-AT. After 7 days of growth at 30°C, positive colonies were picked and transferred into 96-well culture plates and grown for an additional 3 days at 30°C. Some of each cultured positive clone was used for β-galactosidase assays and DNA sequencing of the prey clones insert, and the remainder was stored at −80°C. The collected positive clones were treated with Zymolyase solution [2.5 mg/ml of Zymolyase-100T; (Seikagaku America Inc., EastFalmouth, MA, USA), 1.2 M sorbitol, 0.1 M Na phosphate, pH 7.4] for 30 min at 37°C and then used as templates for amplification of prey clone inserts using the following primers: 5′-TACCACTACAATGGATGATG-3′ and 5′-GGGGTTTTTCAGTATCTACG-3′. Amplified fragments were sequenced using the same primers to obtain sequence tags. The resulting sequences were compared with the RhizoBase (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/rhizobase) to determine the genomic region which interacted with each bait protein.2.3. Homolog search and calculation of interaction generalityMesorhizobium loti genes whose homologs are conserved in three rhizobia were selected according to the criteria described by Kaneko et al.2 The lower threshold of acceptability was set at 0.25 of the BLASTP bit score reported by self-comparison. Paralogous genes of M. loti were selected if the Smith–Waterman score was greater than 200.The calculation of the interaction generality (IG) values of each interaction was conducted using the methods described in the previous report.213. Results and discussion3.1. Design of a high-throughput YTH system and selection of M. loti genes for screeningTo facilitate the efficiency and accuracy of directional in-frame cloning of M. loti genes, we used a Gateway-compatible vector system to construct bait clones (Fig. 1). Using this system, we successfully cloned 1542 full-length M. loti genes (21% of the total M. loti genes, Supplementary Table 1) into the Gateway entry vector. Since the insert of each entry clone can be easily transferred to other destination vectors via Gateway recombination, the constructed Gateway entry clones can also be used as material resources for many other analyses of M. loti genes.Flow chart of the sequential steps in the YTH analysis of M. loti (see Materials and Methods for details). BD and AD indicate the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and GAL4 activation domain, respectively.Flow chart of the sequential steps in the YTH analysis of M. loti (see Materials and Methods for details). BD and AD indicate the GAL4 DNA-binding domain and GAL4 activation domain, respectively.In order to screen various potential PPIs efficiently, we constructed prey library from GAL4 activation domain-fused random genomic library and screened the library using a yeast-mating method. By using the random fragment library as prey clones, information on interaction pairs and interacting regions of the prey proteins can be obtained simultaneously. All selected positive clones were processed in 96-well plate format and data of a large number of sequence tags derived from positive clones were processed by the same semi-automated system developed by Sato et al.22Using this high-throughput YTH system, we explored large-scale PPI analysis in the nitrogen-fixing soil bacteria, M. loti. As shown in Table 1, we selected M. loti genes for YTH screening on the basis of the following features: (i) genes whose expression is up-regulated under bacteroid or microaerobic condition and genes located in symbiosis island, and (ii) genes whose homologs are conserved in other rhizobium genomes.Mesorhizobium loti genes used for YTH analysisMesorhizobium loti genes used for YTH analysisUp-regulated genes were selected by referring to the macroarray analysis of M. loti.14 On the basis of the supplemental information provided with the macroarray analysis, 93 and 72 genes were selected as highly up-regulated under bacteroid state and microaerobic condition, respectively (Supplementary Table 1). Genes located in symbiosis island were selected from genomic information of M. loti.1 We selected 416 genes (excluding those genes with transposon-related functions and those previously selected as up-regulated under bacteroid or microaerobic condition) from the location of symbiosis island (Supplementary Table 1). Genes whose homologs are conserved in other rhizobium genomes were selected by comparing the genome sequences of three rhizobium species, M. loti strain MAFF303099 (symbiont for Lotus japonicus), Sinorhizobium meliloti strain 1021 (alfalfa symbiont), and Bradyrhizobium japonicum strain USDA110 (soybean symbiont), whose complete genome sequences were available when this study was initiated. When genes were selected by the criteria described in Materials and methods, 2797 genes were found to be conserved among three rhizobia species. Of these, we selected 858 M. loti genes that were categorized to regulatory function (227 genes), hypothetical protein (479 genes), and unknown protein (152 genes). Altogether, a total of 1640 genes, including 201 genes selected for other purposes, were selected as target genes for this study (Supplementary Table 1).3.2. Assessment of the PPI dataOf the 1640 genes targeted, 1542 (21% of all predicted M. loti genes) bait clones were constructed successfully (Table 2). PPIs were identified on 57% of the bait clones, resulting in 3121 putative interaction pairs consisting of 1804 M. loti proteins. (Fig. 2, Supplementary Table 2; all PPI data are also available from RhizoBase, http://bacteria.kazusa.or.jp/rhizobase).Global view of the PPIs of M. loti. (A) All detected PPIs.

Percentages represent the coverage of interacting proteins in each function category.Summary of experimental resultsSummary of experimental resultsOne of the major concerns of large-scale PPI analysis is its reliability. PPI data obtained from comprehensive analyses generally contains numerous false positives, which are mainly caused by promiscuous interactions and self-activation of bait clones.21,23 Therefore, the detected interactions need to be evaluated by some appropriate criteria. Ito et al. employed interaction sequence tags (ISTs), a pair of tagged sequences obtained from interacting bait and prey clones, to weigh the reliability of each detected interaction.16 They handled the interactions with high IST hits as ‘core’ data, which is assumed to be of high relevance and to contain many biologically meaningful interactions. Similarly, as one indicator of data reliability, we classified all detected interactions into four distinct categories (category A–D) based on how many positive clones supported the interaction. Category A and B consist of interactions supported by multiple positive clones with different (A) or identical (B) inserts. Category C consists of interactions supported by a single positive clone. Interactions supported by prey clones that interacted with more than 18 different baits, i.e. 1% of all interacting proteins, were considered promiscuous interactions and classified in category D. Most promiscuously interacting proteins were soluble proteins, and 10 out of 18 promiscuous proteins possessed at least one protein domain known to cause promiscuous interactions24,25 (Supplementary Table 3). Other than the promiscuous interaction domains, no remarkable physicochemical properties common to the promiscuous proteins, such as isoelectric point or hydrophobicity, were found. The number of interactions in each category is shown in Table 2.To assess the validity of our categorization, we evaluated all detected interactions using the IG measurement, a method for computationally assessing the reliability of PPI.21 Interactions with lower IG values are more likely to be reliable than interactions with higher IG values. The IG values for all detected interactions ranged from 1 to 62 and the average IG value was 10.2. When we examined the interactions in which the IG values were <5, >94% of interactions in category A, B, and C were included, whereas only 32% of category D interactions were included (Supplementary Fig. 1). The average IG values for category A (2.37 ± 0.16), B (2.21 ± 0.17), and C (2.75 ± 0.72) were significantly lower (P < 0.01) than that of category D (26.0 ± 3.49) when 50 independent interactions were selected randomly from each category and compared. This result indicates that our classification is appropriate to define the reliability of each interaction.To minimize false positives caused by self-activation, we used multiple reporter genes driven by different GAL4-responsive promoters and carefully determined the level of self-activation of each bait clone (see Materials and methods). Furthermore, we re-screened bait proteins under more stringent conditions when the bait protein generated an excessive number of positive colonies (>300 colonies per bait). As shown in Table 2, 31 bait proteins displayed strong self-activation which could not be suppressed by leaky HIS3 reporter gene expression even in the presence of 50 mM 3-AT and the interactions derived from these strong self-active bait clones were discarded. A total of 148 bait clones (9.6% of all screened baits) were screened in the presence of 50 mM 3-AT (Supplementary Table 4). As expected, several bait clones harboring genes with regulatory functions such as transcriptional regulators or two-component response regulators (RRs) showed self-activation. However, 92 out of 148 were genes annotated as hypothetical or unknown protein. To examine the protein domains responsible for their self-activation, we examined the known protein domains assigned in these genes. Although several kinds of bacterial regulatory protein domains, such as LuxR (IPR000792), LysR (IPR000847), and RR receiver (REC) (IPR001789) domain, are frequently found among self-active genes, some proteins with a domain of unknown function (DUF domain) and hypothetical or unknown proteins with no known protein domains were also included.In addition to the detection of false positives, large-scale PPI analyses tend to miss a large number of known interactions (false negatives). The precise proportion of false-negative interactions can be determined by comparison with published experimental PPI data.18 However, this approach is difficult to apply to M. loti PPI analysis because the available data regarding protein interactions of M. loti are limited. To compensate for this problem, we estimated the proportion of false-negatives based on the interactions of proteins in two-component signal transducers whose interaction can be predicted by the location of the corresponding genes in the genome. In the M. loti genome, 30 pairs of genes encoding a sensor histidine kinase (HK) and RR are considered to forms operons and, of these, 15 pairs were detected from screening all RR and 37 HK used as bait, indicating that ∼50% of the interactions could not be detected by our analysis.3.3. General features of PPIsA global view of the protein interaction network is illustrated in Fig. 2A. Proteins (nodes) and interactions (edges) are colored according to their functional categories and interaction categories, respectively. Proteins in the obtained protein network cover all functional categories of M. loti (Fig. 2B), and interactions are presented as scale-free network, since most proteins had few connections and only a small number had many connections.Prokaryotic genes are generally organized into operons in which genes are transcribed as a polycistronic mRNA. Several previous studies have demonstrated that genes encoded in the same operon are likely to be coordinately linked and carry out related functions.26,27 In all the interactions detected, we found 36 interacting pairs that were encoded by genes that mapped to adjacent loci in the M. loti genome (Supplementary Table 5a and b). Notably, 14 out of 36 protein pairs were category A interactions and the frequency of category A interactions between proteins encoded by adjacent genes is significantly higher than that of the whole network. This result further supports the validity of our evaluation of protein interaction data by interaction category. Among the interacting protein encoded at adjacent loci, 15 interactions contained at least one protein of unknown function. Among these, we found a putative part of a sarcosine oxidase complex composed of Mll6238 (annotated as sarcosine oxidase alpha subunit) and Mll6237 (unknown protein that contains a protein domain of sarcosine oxidase gamma subunit). We also found a putative protein complex required for chromosome condensation and segregation between Mll1088 (hypothetical protein contains ScpA domain; IPR003768) and Mll1087 (hypothetical protein contains ScpB domain; IPR005234). Considering that genes belonging to the same operon are predicted to have related functions, the interactions extracted according to the genomic position permit us to predict the biological function of unknown proteins and provides experimental evidence to reinforce the functional relationships between proteins encoded by adjacent genes.We also identified 25 self-interacting proteins and 9 hetero-dimeric interactions that occurred between two paralogous proteins (Supplementary Table 6). Approximately half of the self-interacting proteins have regulatory functions, and some contained several types of helix-turn-helix (HTH) motifs. This result is reasonable because HTH-containing proteins are known to execute their function in the form of homo-dimers or homo-tetramors28 and homo-dimeric forms of these proteins have been identified in several microorganisms by large-scale PPI analysis and X-ray diffraction.29,30 Furthermore, as observed in yeast and some other eucaryotes,31 the paralogous-interacting proteins detected here tended to exhibit self-interaction. For example, the self-interacting Mll3429 and Mlr5643 also interacted with their paralogues, Mll2335 and Mll3718, respectively. In addition, three other proteins (Mlr6361, Shikimate kinase; Mll8202, GroES; and Mlr2806, NolR) are also known to form homo-dimers,32–34 indicating that this tendency may support the hypothesis that duplication of self-interacting proteins can generate paralogous proteins whose interactions create functional and structural diversification.22,313.4. Interaction of symbiosis related proteinsYTH screening with 581 genes that were selected based on their expression profiles and location in symbiosis island generated 646 interaction pairs (excluding category D interactions). Among the relatively reliable interactions (interaction categories A and B), the proportion of interactions between proteins encoded in symbiosis island was significantly higher (20%) than the ratio expected (8%) by random interactions. This result may reflect the existence of interrelated functions among proteins within the symbiosis island, as suggested by the clustered expression of genes in symbiosis island under the bacteroid state.14In the M. loti genome, 40 genes for nodulation and 46 genes for nitrogen fixation were assigned by whole genome sequencing.1 Interactions were detected on 13 genes for nodulation and 27 genes for nitrogen fixation, respectively. Among these interactions, we successfully identified several interaction pairs whose functional relationships have been proven experimentally, such as NtrX (Mlr0400)–NtrY (Mlr0399) and FixL (Mll6607)–FixJ (Mll6606), which are two-component sensor-regulator pairs that participate in nitrogen metabolisms and sensing of environmental oxygen tension,35 and NtrR (Mll1670)–NtrP (Mll1671) operon that function in complex as toxin-antitoxin module.36 Detection of these known interactions indicates that the rhizobial proteins we screened here retained their native conformation in yeast cells.One of the advantages of interactome analysis is that interactions between novel proteins and well-characterized ones provide us highly informative hints to expand our knowledge, and such interactions were found on several symbiosis-related proteins. For example, a two-component RR (Mll9592) encoded in the M. loti plasmid (pMLb) interacted with two distinct NifA proteins (Mll5857 and Mll5837). NifA is a transcriptional activator that controls, in concert with RNA polymerase sigma factor, the expression of genes for nitrogen fixation.37,38 Unlike other known sigma factor-interacting transcriptional activators such as DctD and NtrC,39 NifA protein lacks the REC domain which accept the phosphoryl signal from the cognate sensor HK. In contrast, Mll9592 contains a REC domain but lacks any DNA binding domains. Considering their physical interaction and the distribution of protein domains, Mll9592 may execute its function by forming a complex with NifA proteins.We identified several interactions of proteins encoded by genes whose expression is up-regulated in the bacteroid state or by microaerobic condition. It is noteworthy that approximately one-third of the proteins that interacted with proteins encoded by the up-regulated genes are functionally unannotated proteins. For example, msr6604 which encodes small protein of unknown function that located upstream of the FixLJ (mll6606–mll6607) operon interacted with both FixL (Mll6607) and FixJ (Mll6606) (Supplementary Table 7). Likewise, Mll9215 which was annotated as unknown protein interacted with two distinct FixO proteins (Mll6629 and Mlr6412) (Supplementary Table 7) and expression of the three genes encoding these proteins was up-regulated in the bacteroid state.14 Furthermore, interaction of proteins encoded by up-regulated genes also revealed putative interaction on several molecular chaperones. For instance, Mll3429 (endopeptidase Clp ATP-binding chain B; ClpB) interacted with Mll2335 (probable ClpA/B-type protease). The expression of mll3429 was up-regulated under microaerobiosis14 and its orthologous protein (blr1404) of B. japonicum USDA110 were identified to be expressed specifically in soybean nodule.9,13 This result indicates that interaction between Mll3429 and Mll2335 may be a part of protease complex that function in protein processing during symbiosis. In addition, Mll3623 (unknown protein) interacted with two paralogous heat-shock proteins (Mlr4721 and Mlr4720) encoded by genes in the same operon. The genes encoding these heat-shock proteins were up-regulated under microaerobic condition,14 indicating that Mll3623 may be a target of these heat-shock proteins or may be involved in protection of proteins against microaerobic stress-induced protein denaturation and aggregation. Although the biological significance of these interactions remains to be solved, our results imply that many proteins of unknown function are involved in various aspects of symbiotic nitrogen fixation and our PPI data will provide useful clues to reveal the functional relationships between them.3.5. Interactions of proteins with regulatory functionsIn order to acquire PPI information leads to understanding of signal transduction pathways that functioned in rhizobium, we screened M. loti genes with regulatory functions. Among 295 selected genes (including 234 conserved genes), 286 bait clones were used for screening and 618 PPIs were obtained from 207 bait clones.Among these PPIs, many interaction pairs of two-component signal transducers were detected as reliable interactions (Fig. 3). Two-component signal transduction systems, composed of a HK and RR, are the predominant systems by which bacteria sense several environmental changes, and through a linear phosphorelay from the HK to its cognate RR, cells can adapt rapidly to new conditions. Considering their specific functional relationship, the interaction of two-component signal transducers are suitable models not only to evaluate our PPI data but also to reveal novel part of signaling pathways in M. loti. In the M. loti genome, 46 and 58 genes encoding HK and RR are assigned, respectively, and, among them, 30 pairs of HK and RR are considered to be transcribed in single operons.40 From screening of 38 HKs and all the RRs as bait, 33 interactions between HK and RR were obtained (Fig. 3). Among these interactions, we successfully identified 15 pairs of HK and RR that encoded by the same operon, and most of these interactions were supported by multiple positive clones. These interactions, for examples, identified a part of putative chemotaxis pathway of M. loti (CheW; mll9513–CheA; mll9511–CheA; mll9511–CheY; mll9509) as observed in PPI analysis of other bacteria.30,41 Detection of putative cognate pairs of HK and RR as relatively reliable interactions strongly supports the validity of the screen scale and the specificity of our YTH analysis. We also identified 18 pairs of interactions between HK and RR that were located in different regions of the M. loti genome (e.g. Mll7700–Mll0861). Since it is difficult to know the specific functional partner of HK or RR from their sequence, the interaction pairs described here provide evidence to support the functional relationships among putative cognate HK and RR encoded in a single operon and also allow us to predict the functional partners of HK or RR located in different regions of the M. loti genome. In addition to one-to-one interactions between HK and RR, we found several interactions that occurred between multiple HKs and a single RR, and vice versa (e.g. Mll6691 and Mlr6540). The existence of cross-regulation in two-component systems has been reported in several bacteria,42 but not in rhizobia. Therefore, the PPIs obtained here for multiple HKs and RRs reveals, for the first time, putative cross-regulation in two-component systems in rhizobia.Interaction pairs of two-component signal transducers.

Interactions of proteins of unknown functionAmong the 7281 predicted ORFs of M. loti, ∼46% (3371 ORFs) are functionally unannotated (categorized as hypothetical or unknown protein).1 To assign some functional information to hypothetical and unknown proteins of M. loti, we examine all the interactions containing these proteins and characterized them based on their interactions with partners of known function. When 877 genes of unknown function were screened as bait (including 608 genes screened as conserved genes), 1598 interactions between a protein of known function and unknown function were obtained (Table 3). Of these, 569 proteins of unknown function had at least one partner of known function and 94 showed interactions with two or more known protein of same function category. For example, Mlr0746 (unknown protein) interacted with three distinct transcriptional regulators (Mlr0745, Mll5360, and Mll2255) which are paralogous proteins with the same protein domains (Supplementary Table 7), suggesting that Mlr0746 may have any roles in regulating transcription. Furthermore, to obtain more detailed information about the function unknown proteins, we examined the PPIs of function unknown proteins at the level of protein domains. By focusing on common interaction partners or common protein domains, we assigned 42 unannotated (including 25 conserved) proteins to nine distinct functional categories (Supplementary Table 7). This approach allowed us to identify component of protein complexes that had not been assigned by gene annotation. For example, Mll2736 (hypothetical protein) which contains a ClpS core domain (IPR003769) interacts with two distinct Clp proteases (Mll0663 and Mll2335). Mlr3346 (hypothetical protein) contains a phosphonate metabolism PhnJ domain (IPR010306) and interacts with paralogous hypothetical proteins (Mll9155 and Mlr3342) that contain a phnG domain (IPR009609). On the basis of the fact that proteins with related functions tend to interact, these interactions should reflect the functional properties of the unannotated proteins of M. loti. Actually, previous works have predicted the functions of unannotated proteins from large-scale PPI data using similar strategies.43–45 Since the functional relationships described here could not be determined from genome sequences or other genome-wide analyses, our data should provide novel and useful information for elucidating the biological roles of many unannotated proteins of rhizobia.Summary of interactions with proteins of unknown functionSummary of interactions with proteins of unknown functionOur results provide a comprehensive data source for PPIs of M. loti proteins. From this PPI data, we have predicted putative novel relationships among proteins for symbiotic nitrogen fixation and signal transduction and have provided some functional information on several unannotated proteins. Since our study examined primarily on proteins playing certain roles in symbiotic nitrogen fixation (i.e. one of the unique characteristics of rhizobium) and proteins conserved in other rhizobia, the data are applicable to further functional studies of many rhizobial species, as well as M. loti. To make the interaction data publicly available, we provide all obtained PPI data through rhizobial genome database, RhizoBase (http://bacteria.kazusa.or.jp/rhizobase/index.html). In the database, we have provided all PPI data including the interaction category and interacting region of the prey protein so that users can obtain PPI information depending on their own needs.Although some of our findings will be needed to be confirmed by independent approaches, we believe that the obtained PPI data should provide a useful starting point to elucidate the biological function of many rhizobial genes.FundingKAKENHI (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research) on Priority Areas “Comparative Genomics” from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan.We would like to thank Drs S.

IntroductionPathogenic bacteria are distinct from related non-pathogenic strains in that they possess and express virulence genes. The major avenue for the acquisition of virulence genes is the horizontal transfer of DNA segments.1 In many pathogenic bacteria, multiple virulence factors function to achieve successful infection and population bursts in niches by protecting bacteria from host defense systems. Multiple virulence genes in different chromosomal loci must often be simultaneously expressed during the various stages of infection. Thus, the integration of the acquired genes, which are scattered throughout the chromosome, into the gene-regulatory systems is important for establishing pathogenic strains. Because the repertoire of virulence traits is often variable among the strains of the same species, bacterial pathogenicity is a dynamic process involving the ongoing addition of novel virulence genes. Therefore, plasticity that allows newly transferred virulence genes to be adopted must also be a characteristic of the virulence-regulatory system. To understand the emergence and evolution of pathogenic bacteria, therefore, the molecular basis of virulence gene regulation must be elucidated.Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) causes hemorrhagic colitis and hemolytic uremic syndrome.2 A comparison of the genomic sequences of EHEC O157:H7 Sakai strain with that of the non-pathogenic E. coli strain K-12 revealed many EHEC O157-specific loci (called S-loops), most of which contain gene clusters.3 One of the virulence-associated loci is the locus for enterocyte effacement (LEE), which encodes a type III secretion system (T3SS), type III secreted effectors, and adhesin. These virulence factors are necessary for the induction of attaching and effacing (A/E) lesions in epithelial cells, which are characterized by a rearrangement of the cytoskeleton and the destruction of microvilli.4,5 In addition to the LEE, gene-encoding effectors for T3SS can be found elsewhere on the chromosome,6 mostly at the end of lambdoid-like prophages, which are scattered throughout the chromosome.7 The mosaic nature of the pathogenic E. coli genome suggests that virulence traits are acquired through the capture of mobile elements such as phages, insertion sequences, and plasmids. In particular, lambdoid phage appears to have a major role in the emergence of EHEC strains, given that a variety of effector genes are encoded by several prophages lysogenized at different loci on the chromosome.7 Therefore, for pathogenicity to be established, the expression kinetics of genes in different chromosomal loci must be appropriately orchestrated.The transcription of LEE genes is regulated by two positive transcriptional regulators: Pch regulators activate the transcription of the LEE1 operon, which encodes the transcriptional regulator Ler, which in turn regulates other LEE operons and genes in other loci.8 Ler belongs to the H-NS family of nucleoid-associated proteins, exhibiting homology with the carboxy-termini of these proteins corresponding to DNA-binding domain.9 Ler has been shown to activate LEE gene expression by counteracting the repression by H-NS.10 EHEC strains possess five genes that encode homologs of Pch, though only two, pchA and pchB, activate LEE1 transcription.8 Pch is also a small protein as Ler, but it showed no homology with nucleoid-associated protein or transcription regulators. The expression of LEE genes is regulated in response to changes in environmental factors, such as the growth phase, temperature, osmolarity, bicarbonate ion concentration, membrane stress, and nutrient starvation.11–14 Both Pch and Ler are major regulators of LEE gene expression in response to such changes. For example, transient growth arrest caused by insufficient nutrients or by entry into the stationary growth phase induces the expression of LEE genes through increased production of both Pch and Ler, because the transcription of pch genes and the LEE1 operon is positively regulated by starvation-induced signal molecule, ppGpp.13 Furthermore, the activation of the RcsC–RcsD–RcsB phospho-relay system, which is thought to be a signal transduction system for responding membrane stress, affects the expression of LEE genes both positively and negatively through the activation of grvA, encoding a transcription regulator and the repression of pch.12 Thus, environmental factors are evaluated by a sensing system common to all E. coli strains. In EHEC O157:H7, however, the signals from the sensing system also affect the transcription of O157-specific transcription regulators, which results in the coordinated regulation of the virulence genes in response to certain environmental changes.In this study, in order to clarify which genes are involved in the pathogenicity of EHEC and the regulatory networks that govern the LEE and related genes, we isolated genes under the control of the two major virulence regulators, Pch and Ler, by comparing the changes in global transcription caused by altering the pch and ler expression levels. We identified two sets of genes whose transcription profiles were closely correlated with those of LEE genes. Furthermore, we determined the binding sites for PchA and Ler, and found that, although Pch was involved in the regulation of genes in both classes, Ler regulated the expression of only one class of genes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains and growth conditionsEHEC O157 Sakai (RIMD 0509952)3 and its derivative strains used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Deletion mutants of EHEC O157 Sakai were constructed using the method and plasmids of Datsenko and Wanner.15 DNA fragments corresponding to the pchA and ler genes were isolated by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) from the chromosomal DNA of O157 Sakai using specific primers: 5′-CACAGGAATATATCCGTACCC-3′ and 5′-AGTATGTGTCACTGGCCTATACGG-3′ for pchA, and 5′-TTGGCTCACAATACTCATCC-3′ and 5′-GCTTAACTAAATGGAAATGC-3′ for ler. The PCR amplicon was cloned into pGEM-T (Promega) in the direction opposite to that of the lac promoter. The pchA gene of EHEC Sakai ΔpchB ΔpchC was tagged at the 3′-terminus with Strep-tag (IBA), and the ler gene in wild-type O157 Sakai was tagged with 3× FLAG sequence, using an epitope-tagging procedure.16 Bacteria were grown overnight in Luria-Bertani broth (LB), diluted 100-fold, and then cultured in LB or Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) without fetal calf serum, at 37°C with shaking.2.2. Transcriptome analysisTotal RNA from EHEC was isolated with TRI reagent (Sigma) using the method recommended by the manufacturer. The RNA was purified again after treatment with RNase-free DNase I (Takara), and the amount and purity of the RNA were determined by measuring A260 and A280. The RNAs from EHEC were used to synthesize cDNAs with Cy-3- or Cy-5-conjugated dUTP. cDNA labeling, microarray hybridization, data capture, and data analysis were performed as described previously.12 We used a DNA microarray with oligo-DNAs specific for each of the CDS of EHEC O157 Sakai.12,17 The expression ratio used here is to indicate the average of the ratios obtained in the two independent experiments in which the signal intensities were greater than the mean ±1 SD of the negative control. The hierarchical clustering of gene expression profiles and conditions were analyzed using GeneSpring GX7.3 (Agilent Technologies). The raw and processed data are available in the GEO of NCBI (in accession no. GSE9752).2.3. Design of EHEC O157 tiled microarraysThe EHEC O157 Sakai genome sequence and other genetic information were retrieved from the O157 Web site at NAIST (http://genome.naist.jp/bacteria/o157/) and used to design probes, following the Affymetrix guidelines (http://www.affymetrix.com). Two versions of the microarray were used in this study. One contained 25-nt-long probe sequences separated by 103 (±5)-base intervals in the coding region and by intervals of 35 (±2) bases in the intergenic region along both strands of the O157 Sakai chromosome. The other contained 25-nt-long probe sequences separated by 45-base intervals, as possible, from only a single strand of the chromosome. If the sequence was not correct, the probe was offset with sequence within 10 bases. Thus, perfect-match probes and corresponding mismatch probes were synthesized on the chip.2.4. ChIP-on-chipChromosome immunoprecipitation and DNA microarray analysis were performed as described by Oshima et al.18 with slight modifications. EHEC O157 Sakai strain SKI1172 or SKI1282 was grown in DMEM to logarithmic phase (OD600 = 0.7 − 0.8) at 37°C. Formaldehyde (final concentration of 1%) was added to 10 mL of the culture, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 20 min. To terminate the crosslinking reaction, glycine (final concentration of 0.45 M) was added, and the mixture was incubated at room temperature for 5 min. Bacteria were collected by centrifugation and washed first with Tris buffered saline, then with washing buffer [50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 0.01% Tween-20] twice, suspended in 1 mL of lysis buffer [50 mM sodium phosphate (pH 8.0), 300 mM NaCl, 1% Tween-20, 20 mg/mL lysozyme], and stored at −20°C until use. Bacteria were lysed by incubation at 37°C for 30 min and diluted in 4 mL of washing buffer containing phenylmethanesulphonylfluoride (final concentration of 1 mg/mL). The solution was then sonicated 15 times for 30 s at 30 s intervals at 4°C using a Bioruptor UCD-200 (Cosmo Bio Co., Ltd.). Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 15 000 rpm for 30 min. An 800 µL aliquot of the supernatant was mixed with magnetic beads bound to an anti-FLAG antibody (M2 monoclonal antibody, Sigma-Aldrich) or MagStrep (IBA) antibody and incubated at 4°C overnight. The beads were washed three times with washing buffer and then with TE (10 mM Tris-HCL (pH8.0), 1 mM EDTA). The protein–DNA complex bound to the beads was released in 100 mL of elution buffer [50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM EDTA, 1% SDS] by heating at 65°C for 20 min for Ler-FLAG, or in Biotin buffer [50 mM Tris (pH 7.8), 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 10 mM Biotin] incubated at room temperature for 10 min for PchA-Strep. DNA fragments crosslinked to proteins were released by incubating the eluate with proteinase K (1 mg/mL) at 42°C for 2 h, then 65°C for 6 h, and purified using the Qiagen PCR Clean-up kit (Qiagen) in 200 µL of TE. Recovered DNA fragments were amplified, terminally labeled, and hybridized with the EHEC O157 tiled microarray as described previously.18 The raw intensity data (CEL files) were processed using the In Silico Molecular Cloning Array Edition software (In Silico Biology) for analysis and visualization. Signal intensities were obtained by subtracting the signal intensities of the mismatch probes from those of the perfect-match probes, and probes with negative values were excluded from further analysis. To compensate for differences among the probes caused by different probabilities of DNA disruption and hybridization efficiency, signals were normalized by dividing them by the signal intensities from DNA samples taken before the beads were added. The binding sites for PchA-Strep and Ler-FLAG were assessed manually. The reproducibility and specificity of binding of PchA or Ler to several novel sites were confirmed by ChIP-PCR for each site.3. Results and discussion3.1. Identification of Pch- and/or Ler-regulated genesThe genes in the LEE pathogenicity island are organized mainly into five operons, LEE1 to LEE5, and several cistrons. The transcription of the LEE genes is positively regulated by the Ler protein, which is encoded by the first gene of the LEE1 operon. Transcription of the LEE1 operon is regulated by several proteins conserved in the non-pathogenic E. coli K12 strain, including IHF, QseA, and H-NS, and by the O157-specific regulator, Pch.8,14,19,20 EHEC O157:H7 Sakai strain possesses three intact pch genes, which encode proteins that differ by only one or two amino acids, and are located in different prophage-like elements.To elucidate the network created by O157-specific regulators, the effect of the overproduction or deletion of Ler or Pch on global transcription levels was determined using DNA microarray hybridization. We determined differences in the transcript levels for all the genes in EHEC O157 Sakai strain in 13 comparisons (Fig. 1): ler null mutant against wild-type EHEC, a pchA-pchB-pchC triple mutant against wild type, EHEC harboring a high copy number of the ler or pchA gene against EHEC harboring a control vector, the ler mutant harboring a high copy number of the pchA gene against the ler mutant harboring the control vector, the pchA-pchB-pchC triple mutant harboring a high copy number of the ler gene against the pch triple-mutant harboring the control vector, and the pchA-pchB double mutant harboring a high copy number of ler against the double mutant harboring the control vector. Since the expression level of LEE genes in EHEC O157, when grown in tissue culture medium DMEM, is much higher than that in EHEC grown in LB, we included the differences in broth media as other factors affecting expression of EHEC genes. Except for the last case (grown in LB), all comparisons were carried out for bacteria grown in LB and DMEM.Hierarchical cluster analysis of gene expression changes in response to changes in Pch or Ler levels.

The scale bar indicates color coding of the RNA levels. Class L1 with subclasses I and II, class L2, and class N are indicated (see text).The EHEC genes were subjected to clustering analysis by standard correlation to determine their transcript expression patterns (Fig. 1). As expected, genes belonging to the LEE showed similar expression profiles, and we classified them as part of a single group, class L1, which also included genes that were not encoded within the LEE (Fig. 2). Within the LEE-encoded genes of class L1, there were two distinct subgroups. One subgroup contained all the LEE1 operon genes except ler, and the other contained most of the other LEE genes (Supplementary Table S2). We found that the transcript levels of the LEE1 genes were increased by PchA overexpression in both wild-type EHEC and the ler deletion mutant, but the transcript levels of the other LEE genes were enhanced by PchA overexpression only in the presence of the ler gene. Because the transcript data were obtained from ler null mutant or from strains harboring multiple copies of ler, the ler gene itself could not be classified in this experiment.Characteristics of genes in each cluster. Number of genes in three gene classes, L1, L2 and N, which were isolated by transcriptomic analysis, was shown. Genes were sorted by chromosomal locus and function as follows: black, LEE genes; grey, non-LEE virulence-associated genes; light grey, other genes in S-loop; white, genes on K12-common loci.Characteristics of genes in each cluster.

Genes were sorted by chromosomal locus and function as follows: black, LEE genes; grey, non-LEE virulence-associated genes; light grey, other genes in S-loop; white, genes on K12-common loci.The three class L1 effector genes that lie outside the LEE were nleA, espF-U/tccP, and espJ. The nleA/espI gene is a single cistron on prophage Sp9 and is required for Citrobacter rodentium, an A/E mouse pathogen, to colonize the mouse colon.21EspF-U/TccP is necessary for the recruitment of actin to Tir beneath attached bacteria, which is essential for A/E lesion formation.22,23 Two genes, espF-U/tccP and espJ, are located on lambdoid-like prophage Sp14 and constitute an operon.24,25 Since the espF-M gene of EHEC O157 Sakai is a pseudogene,23 it is likely that espF-M was detected because of cross-hybridization with espF-U/tccP. Finally, class L1 included three unknown O157-specific genes in an S-loop, ECs0355, ECs0356, ECs0814, and the plasmid-born gene tagA. In addition, the transcription levels of three genes common to EHEC O157:H7 and K-12 in the E. coli backbone chromosome were regulated in close correlation with the LEE genes. These genes, ECs0512 (ylaD), ECs0513 (hha), and ECs0514 (ybaJ), are likely to comprise an operon. The hha gene encodes a transcription regulator for ler.26The expression profile of the class L1 cluster was correlated with that of another cluster of genes. We designated these genes as class L2 (Fig. 1). Class L2 contained 140 CDS/genes, consisting of 89 genes in an S-loop and 51 genes in the backbone or K-12 common chromosome (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S3). Although the transcript levels of the class L2 genes increased with increased Pch levels, like the genes in class L1, their response to increased levels of Ler was different, in that the L2 transcript levels increased only slightly with the overexpression of Ler when grown in LB. In contrast, the genes in L1 showed a marked increase in transcript level with high levels of Ler, even in LB.Class L2 contained 20 non-LEE effector genes that encode T3SS-secreted proteins. Most of these effector genes are located on exchangeable effector loci (EEL) of lambda-like prophages,7 including Sp3, Sp6, Sp9, Sp10, Sp11, Sp17, and SpLE3 (Fig. 2). This observation of the expression and T3SS-dependent secretion of these effectors when the EHEC harbored a high copy number of the pchA gene is consistent with our previous report.7 All the effectors, except EspM2 (encoded by ECs3485), that were found in the culture supernatant of EHEC were regulated coordinately with the LEE genes. The expression of another effector gene, ECs4653, which encodes EspY4, was also upregulated by Ler and Pch, just like the other non-LEE effector genes.Some genes were regulated in conjunction with their neighbors because of members of the same operon. One cluster of these genes, ECs0240–ECs0245, lies in the rhsI element, which is one of nine rhs elements in EHEC O157 Sakai. ECs0815 and ECs0816 seem to belong to the same operon and are transcribed in the opposite direction from ECs0814, which belongs to class L1. Another cluster of genes, from ECs3512 to ECs3508, seems to comprise an operon that lies at the end of prophage-like element Sp17. In addition, class L2 included genes for type-II secretion machinery (etpC, etpD, etpE, etpH, and etpK), toxB, and hemolysin (hlyD) on the virulence plasmid pO157 (Supplementary Table S3).One cluster of genes showed a negative correlation in their transcription with changes in Ler or Pch expression (shown as class N in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S4). Most drastically affected were genes associated with an acid-resistant phenotype, which are closely clustered on the chromosome. These genes include hdeA, hdeB, hdeD, gadE (yhiE), gadX, and gadW. One hundred and nineteen genes conserved between K12 and EHEC O157 and 27 O157-specific genes on S-loops formed clusters (Fig. 2). These genes showed very similar changes in transcript levels in response to changes in Ler/Pch levels. Several genes in this class, in addition to gadE, gadX, and gadW, regulate glutamate-dependent acid resistance. The EvgS–EvgA two-component regulatory system controls the expression of gadE, and transcription of the gadXW operon is dependent on alternative sigma factor RpoS, whose gene was also included in this class. Several of these factors, including GadE (YhiE), EvgS–EvgA, and RpoS, negatively affect the expression of LEE genes or bacterial adherence.27–29 Although the ClpXP protease has been shown to contribute indirectly to the expression of the LEE genes,28 the transcription of the clpX–clpP genes was negatively regulated by Ler and Pch.3.2. Identification of binding sites for Pch and LerAlthough transcriptomic analyses revealed that Pch and/or Ler affect the transcription of many genes on S-loops and in the backbone or K-12 common chromosome, the transcript levels of some of them might be regulated indirectly, through proteins from genes that are directly regulated by Pch and/or Ler. To distinguish directly regulated genes from indirectly regulated genes, we determined the binding sites of PchA and Ler on the EHEC O157 Sakai chromosome by chromosome immunoprecipitation (ChIP) or chromosome affinity precipitation, in combination with DNA microarray hybridization. A derivative strain of EHEC O157 Sakai that expresses Strep-tagged PchA (PchA-Strep) or FLAG-tagged Ler (Ler-FLAG) was grown in DMEM to the logarithmic growth phase at 37°C, which is the optimal condition for expression of the LEE genes, and treated with formalin to crosslink the DNA with bound proteins. DNA fragments that bound to PchA-Strep or Ler-FLAG were separated from the bacterial lysate with Strep-Tactin-coated magnetic beads (MagStrep) or anti-FLAG-conjugated magnetic beads. After decrosslinking and purification, the DNA fragments that bound to PchA or Ler were mapped by hybridization with a high-density tiled microarray. We found 259 loci for Pch and 59 for Ler on the chromosome (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). Of these, 43.1% of the Pch-bound loci and 39.0% of the Ler-bound loci were in S-loops or junctions with S-loops and in the backbone or K12-common chromosome. Considering that only 25.5% of the chromosome was unique to the EHEC O157 Sakai strain compared with E. coli K12 strain MG1655, it was clear that Pch and Ler preferentially bound to S-loop sequences rather than to the backbone or K12-common chromosome.Distribution of PchA and Ler binding over the EHEC O157 Sakai chromosome.

Vertical bars indicate the relative hybridization intensity of the precipitated DNA compared with DNA in the supernatant.The expression of the LEE genes is positively regulated by a molecular cascade: Pch is a positive transcriptional regulator for the LEE1 promoter.8 Activation of the LEE1 operon leads to the expression of Ler, which activates the other LEE genes in operons LEE2 to LEE5 and several cistrons. As expected, Pch bound to the LEE1 promoter region (Fig. 4A). In addition, Pch bound to sites throughout the LEE sequence, including the coding region of the LEE1 operon. Furthermore, although the binding was weaker than in the LEE1 operon, Pch bound to other parts of the LEE island: the upstream region of the grlR–grlA operon, the 5′ portions of the LEE2 and LEE3 operons, the downstream portion of the LEE3 operon, the upstream portion of tir, the coding region of cesT, and the downstream portion of eae. Ler bound at similar levels to several regions in the LEE island, mostly in the 5′ regions of operons or genes (Fig. 4A): the intergenic regions between LEE1 and espG and between grlR and ECs4579 (rorf3), the 5′ portions of the LEE2 and LEE3 operons, the intergenic region between cesF and map, and the 5′ regions of escD and sepL.Distribution of PchA and Ler binding in the LEE and EELs.

IS and remnant of IS are shown in light green boxes.EHEC O157 Sakai possesses 24 prophage or prophage-like elements, which make up more than half of the S-loop sequences. The binding loci for Pch and Ler were unevenly distributed in these acquired sequences. They rarely bound to sequences conserved among the phages; rather, they mostly bound to sequences that were unique to each phage element. Nine lambdoid-like phage elements and two phage-like elements possess EEL, which encode the majority of functional effector genes. Binding loci of Pch were detected within the EEL of all phage elements and Ler-binding loci were detected within the EEL of Sp9, Sp14, and SpLE4 (including LEE) (Fig. 4). Among EHEC O157-specific loci, the locus that contains genes for synthesis of polysaccharide moieties of lipopolysaccharide was bound by both Pch and Ler. Other locus that was covered by Pch was ETT2 locus encodes incomplete type III secretion system with truncated substrate genes. Fourteen loci encoding a set of fimbriae biosynthesis genes were identified on EHEC O157 Sakai chromosome. Pch was bound upstream part of 11 fimbriae operons and three of them were also bound by Ler. They include three loci that are conserved in K-12 strain and four loci that are partially conserved in K-12 strain.Although most regions bound by Pch ranged from 0.3 to 0.8 kb, several loci showed binding that extended to as much as 3.0 kb. Of the 59 Ler-binding loci, 46 overlapped with the Pch-binding loci, and all the Ler-binding loci in S-loops also bound Pch. Because of the low resolution of ChIP-chip analysis, we could not identify a consensus sequence for the Pch-binding sites other than that they are of lower G + C content than average of E. coli chromosome. These results suggested that both Pch and Ler are DNA-binding proteins with a low binding specificity.3.3. Correlation between gene transcription profiles and binding by Pch and/or LerWe next considered whether there were differences in binding by Pch and Ler in the L1 and L2 gene classes. Although most of effector genes were transcriptionally activated by Pch, they were classified into two distinctive classes by transcription profiles. Ten effector genes in class L1—seven in the LEE island and three outside it—were regulated coordinately with other LEE genes that function in the biosynthesis of the type III secretion machinery. Both Pch and Ler bound to the upstream or coding sequences of all three L1 prophage-associated effector genes, nleA (ECs1812), espJ (ECs2714), and espF-u/tccP (ECs2715) (Fig. 4D and F), strongly suggesting the direct activation of their transcription through coordinate binding by Pch and Ler.Twenty-one class L2 effector genes were located on seven prophage-like elements scattered throughout the chromosome. In contrast to class L1 effector genes, although Pch bound in and around the L2 effector gene sequences, Ler binding was not detected in many cases (Fig. 4B–E, G, and H). Positions of binding loci of Pch relative to effector genes vary among genes. For example, Pch bound upstream of nleC, nleA, nleG8-2, whereas binding to coding regions were observed for espX7, espN, espJ, and espL2. In the EEL of Sp10, two Pch-binding loci were found upstream and downstream of a cluster of three nleG genes. Three L2 effector genes, nleG5-2 (ECs2154), nleG6-2 (ECs2155), and nleG2-3 (ECs2156), on Sp11 bound Pch only at upstream of the gene cluster. Since the probes for nleG5-2, nleG6-2, and nleG2-3 used in the DNA microarray for transcriptome analysis were the same as for nleG5-1 (ECs1996), nleG6-1 (ECs1995), and nleG2-2 (ECs1994) on Sp11, respectively, it is likely that the signals we detected originated only from the genes on Sp10 and that the genes on Sp11 were less expressed. These binding data suggested that the effector genes in class L2 were directly activated by Pch without Ler.Of the 57 genes in class L1, only three S-loop genes and two K-12 common genes showed no binding by PchA or Ler (Supplementary Table S1). Rather, 68.6% of the L1 S-loop genes bound both Pch and Ler, as did 50% of the L1 backbone or K-12 common genes (Fig. 5). Therefore, most class L1 genes, including those on the backbone, are probably directly regulated by Pch and Ler. However, among the L2 genes, more than half bound neither Pch nor Ler, suggesting that their transcription was regulated indirectly by these proteins. As shown for the effector genes, the non-effector class L2 genes that bound Pch, but not Ler, were much more abundant than those that bound both (Fig. 5 and Table 2). 66.6% of Pch-bound genes were not bound by Ler. This suggested that the transcriptional regulation of the class L2 genes was, overall, directly regulated by Pch without the involvement of Ler.Correlation between Pch and/or Ler binding with transcription profiles. The binding of Pch and Ler to loci in and around genes was determined as in Fig. 2 and Fig. 3. (A) The number of effector genes assigned to class L1 and class L2.

These 40 backbone or K-12 common genes and 11 S-loop genes seemed to be directly regulated by Pch and/or Ler (Table 3). They include genes encoding regulators, yhiF, gadE, gadX, and gadW, and their regulating genes, gadB, hdeA, hdeB, and hdeD. Two genes, yhiF and gadE, inhibit the expression of LEE genes,27 suggesting there is a reciprocal negative interaction between the Pch–Ler virulence regulatory system and the YhiF–GadE regulatory system.ORFs in cluster N with binding sites for Pch/Ler*P, Pch; L, Ler; P + L, Pch and Ler.ORFs in cluster N with binding sites for Pch/Ler*P, Pch; L, Ler; P + L, Pch and Ler.3.4. Global regulation to promote the efficient expression of virulence traitsPch is a 12-kDa protein without significant homology to any transcriptional regulatory proteins except PerC (also called BfpW),30,31 which is encoded on a virulence plasmid of enteropathogenic E. coli. The pch genes encode a transcriptional activator for the LEE1 promoter, and the deletion of pchA and pchB genes greatly reduces the production and secretion of EspB and EspA.8 The introduction of multiple copies of the pchA gene into EHEC O157 enhances the production and secretion of effector proteins, including many non-LEE encoded effectors,7 indicating that Pch is involved in the regulation of non-LEE effector genes as well as of LEE genes. Our study clearly demonstrated that Pch acts as a global regulator of many genes scattered throughout the EHEC O157 chromosome and plasmids. As expected, most effector genes in the EEL on prophage-like elements were positively regulated by Pch. The molecular mechanism of transcriptional activation by Pch may not be simple, since the position of its binding site varied from gene to gene, as did the number of binding sites. Therefore, Pch probably uses a transcriptional activating mechanism that is different from that of a typical transcriptional activator, like an AraC-like protein, which activates transcription by binding upstream of the promoter and interacting with RNA polymerase. The binding of Pch in the coding region or downstream of its target genes suggested that Pch affects promoter activity without directly interacting with RNA polymerase, most likely by inducing changes in the chromosomal structure around the promoter. We could not identify a consensus sequence for Pch binding, besides low G + C content, from the ChIP on chip data, because of low resolution. To characterize more precisely, further analysis such as footprinting must be required.The analysis of transcription profiles revealed that the transcriptional responses of genes in class L1 to changes in the levels of Pch and Ler were slightly different from those of the class L2 genes. Ler binding may be required to activate most class L1 promoters, and these promoters were activated in the absence of Pch as efficiently as in its presence. Although the transcript levels of several L2 genes could be increased in a Pch-negative background by overexpressing Ler, the increase was much smaller than that obtained by the overexpression of Pch. It is likely that Ler was primarily a regulator for a restricted group of genes that are functionally related to the A/E phenotype as compared to Pch. It is supported by one of the non-LEE-encoded effectors, TccP/EspFu, which is required for actin polymerization at the cytoplasmic domain of Tir.22,23 In addition, the nleA (espI) gene of C. rodentium, a mouse A/E pathogen, is involved in the colonization of mouse colon and the induction of hyperplasia.21,32 Finally, since the ler gene is LEE gene, the Ler target genes might primarily be LEE genes.In the process of establishing the pathogenicity of EHEC, genes encoding proteins with A/E phenotype-related functions might be selected and placed under the direct control of Ler. Pch seems to have a broader role in regulating gene expression, since its binding sites were scattered over the chromosome. EHEC O157:H7 Sakai possesses five pch genes, including at least two encoding active proteins and two truncated pseudogenes, on different prophage-like elements.8,13 Furthermore, multiple pch genes are found among EHEC O157 strains and other serotypes of EHEC strains, such as O26, O111, and O103 (Ogura et al., unpublished). These findings suggest that Pch is required for the expression of virulence genes and that the pch gene itself is rather unstable.Horizontally transferred genes are thought to be initially repressed by the binding of H-NS to the DNA around them.18,33 Pch might counteract the effect of H-NS, both by activating the horizontally acquired genes and influencing the expression of genes in the backbone or K-12 common chromosome. The global effect of Pch on both EHEC-specific and K-12 common genes must be to promote the integration of the acquired genes with a virulence regulon and to govern the optimization of virulence expression. Because changing the expression levels of some K-12 common genes could have an adverse effect on bacterial physiology, the virulence-regulatory system must be strictly controlled and activated only when it is required. In fact, the evidence shows that the activation of the virulence-regulatory system is strictly regulated in response to environmental signals, through the expression of both pch and ler.12,13 Thus, the virulence-regulatory system involving Pch and Ler is a good model for understanding the process of the evolution of pathogenicity and the emergence of novel pathogens.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas (C) from The Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan.Supplementary data"

IntroductionGram-positive anaerobic cocci (GPAC) are a major part of the normal human flora colonizing skin and mucous membranes of the mouth and gastrointestinal tracts. GPAC account for 20–40% of all anaerobes recovered from human clinical specimens.1–3 In GPAC, Finegoldia magna (formerly Peptostreptococcus magnus) has the highest pathogenicity and is isolated most frequently from various infection sites, including soft tissue, bone and joint, and diabetic foot infections.1 Approximately 70% of F. magna strains recovered from human clinical materials coexist with other bacterial species such as group D streptococci, Staphylococcus, Bacteroides, and Fusobacterium.4Finegoldia magna has well-known cell surface proteins such as albumin-binding protein and protein L, which may contribute to antiphagocytosis by binding the cell surface to human serum albumin and immunoglobulin light chain, respectively.5–7 Despite this clinical importance of F. magna, other virulence factors and overall genomic information of F. magna have not been extensively studied. Therefore, we have so far constructed the physical map8 and the genetic map9,10 of F. magna strain ATCC 29328, originally isolated from an abdominal wound.Here, we report the complete genome sequence of F. magna ATCC 29328 to characterize its genomic structure in detail and its nature as an opportunistic pathogen. This is the first complete genome sequence among GPAC, and we believe our data will be of great use for genetic studies of other GPAC as well as F. magna.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome sequencingThe nucleotide sequence of the Finegoldia magna ATCC 29328 genome was determined by a whole-genome shotgun strategy. Briefly, F. magna ATCC 29328 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection and was grown anaerobically at 37°C in liquid using Gifu Anaerobic Medium (GAM) (Nissui, Japan) for 39 h. The genomic DNA was isolated according to the conventional method using 0.4 mg/mL achromopeptidase (Wako, Japan), 1.3% sodium dodecyl sulfate and 2 mg Proteinase K (Roche, Germany). The isolated DNA was fragmented using the HydroShear process (GeneMachines Inc., USA). The fragmented DNA was fractionated by agarose gel electrophoresis to isolate the short (1–2 kb) and the long (4–5 kb) fractions of fragments. The 1–2 kb and 4-5 kb DNA were ligated into a HincII-digested pTS1 plasmid vector (Nippon genetech, Japan). The short-insert and the long-insert plasmids were introduced by electroporation into Escherichia coli DH5α and SURE2 (Stratagene, USA), respectively. A total of 38 776 reads (providing a 10-fold coverage) from both ends of inserts was sequenced using dye-terminator chemistry with MegaBACE1000, MegaBACE4000 (GE Healthcare, USA) and ABI 3037xl automated sequencers (ABI, USA). Sequence assembly was carried out using the Phred/Phrap/Consed package.11 Gaps were closed by PCR direct sequencing with oligonucleotide primers designed to anneal to each end of the neighboring contigs and by primer walking with bridge clones. Sequences of four rRNA operons were independently determined by genomic PCR and with BAC library.9,10 Sequencing of one long repeated region on the chromosome was performed by nested-deletion methods using Kilo-sequence deletion kit (Takara, Japan). Finally, sequences of one complete circular chromosome and one complete plasmid were obtained. Overall accuracy of the finished sequence was estimated to have an error rate of <1 per 10 000 bases (Phrap score ≥40).2.2. BioinformaticsProtein coding regions (ORFs >150 bp) were identified using GenomeGambler 1.51,12 CRITICA,13 GeneHacker,14 and Glimmer 2.015 programs. In the initial step of ORF prediction, 205 ORFs showing high similarity to the housekeeping proteins in the Clusters of Orthologous Groups of Proteins (COGs) database16 were selected and used to create the training data set for CRITICA, GeneHacker, and Glimmer programs. Individual predicted ORFs were reviewed manually for the presence of start codons (ATG, TTG, and GTG) and ribosome-binding sequences. Protein functional annotation was based on homology searches against NCBI's non-redundant protein database by BLASTP.17 Transfer RNA genes were predicted by tRNAscan-SE.18 Functional classification of ORFs was made by homology search against COGs using BLASTP. The metabolic pathway was constructed based on the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database19 and was complemented manually according to pathways reported in several anaerobes.20–23 Putative localization of predicted proteins was evaluated by the combination of PSORT24 and SignalP program.25 The characteristic motifs in all protein-coding sequence of ATCC 29328 genome were detected by the Pfam analyses (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/) and COGs database. Sortase homologs and their substrates from the sequences of 15 chromosomes and 30 plasmids derived from 15 Gram-positive bacteria species (include F. magna ATCC 29328), whose both chromosomes and plasmids were sequenced to date, were identified in silico according to methods described by Comfort and Clubb.26 The genomic sequences and the protein tables of bacteria were obtained through the NCBI (National Center of Biological Information, http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/). The complete genome sequence and annotation data of F. magna ATCC 29328 is available from the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database (accession nos. AP008971 and AP008972) and our web site (http://w4.grt.kyushu-u.ac.jp/Fmagna/).3. Results and discussion3.1. General genome featuresThe genome of F. magna ATCC 29328 consists of a circular chromosome (1 797 577 bp) and a plasmid pPEP1 (189 163 bp), with an average G + C content of 32.3 and 29.7%, respectively (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The chromosome size was in good agreement with the size (1886 ± 62 kb) estimated in the physical map which we constructed previously.8 The recognition sites of ApaI, PmeI, SgrAI, and I-CeuI in our physical map8 and the locations of ORFs in our genetic map9,10 were in nearly agreement with those in the complete genome sequence, except missing of an ApaI-fragment (94 bp) in the chromosomal physical map and a inversion of PmeI fragments in the plasmid physical map. We could not find any regions showing significantly higher G + C content on the chromosome, except for four rRNA operon regions (Fig. 1). In the chromosome, we identified 1631 ORFs (FMG_0001–FMG_1631), covering 90.8% of the chromosome. Of these, 1177 (72.1%) could be assigned a putative function, 329 (20.2%) are conserved but the function unknown, and 125 (7.7%) are hypothetical genes unique to F. magna (Table 1). The replication origin of the chromosome was deduced on the basis of the transition point in GC-skew analysis and the vicinal presence of dnaA box.27 A strong bias in gene orientation was observed, as 83.8% of ORFs on the chromosome are transcribed in the same orientation as DNA replication. Similarly, high bias in the gene orientation was observed in the genomes of Clostridium perfringens strain 1320 and Clostridium tetani E88,21 respectively, and appears to be a common feature of low-GC Gram-positive bacteria.20,28,29 Plasmid pPEP1 encodes 182 ORFs (FMG_P0001–FMG_P0182). Of these, 45 (24.7%) could be assigned a putative function, 29 (15.9%) are conserved but the function unknown, and 108 (59.4%) are hypothetical genes (Table 1). The replication origin of the plasmid could not be deduced by GC-skew analysis. Of the total ORFs on the plasmid, 87.4% were encoded on one strand DNA (Fig. 1). The F. magna genome encodes only a few mobile genetic elements. The density of transposase genes per 1 Mb of chromosome in low-GC Gram-positive bacteria ranges from high (10.5 per Mb) in Streptococcus pyogenes MGAS8283 to low (3.63 per Mb) in C. perfringens strain 13. F. magna ATCC 29328 has only one transposase gene (FMG_0928) (0.56 per Mb) on the chromosome. In the plasmid, 14 putative transposase genes were encoded, but four out of 14 were truncated. F. magna has nine putative phage-related ORFs on the chromosome; however, these genes do not constitute a prophage region. Assuming that F. magna is closely related to clostridia10, F. magna has a stable chromosome, like clostridia, and recent events of gene acquisition by horizontal gene transfer are less likely.20–22Circular maps of the chromosome and the pPEP1 plasmid of F. magna ATCC 29328.

Sugar and amino acid metabolismsMost F. magna have a variety of aminopeptidase activities30; however, they have very limited saccharolytic activities.1,31 It is known that most F. magna strains produce weak acid from the fermentation of fructose, and only a few strains produce weak acid from glucose, and all strains tested were unable to produce acid from maltose, mannose, and sucrose.1,31 We found that F. magna ATCC 29328 has a complete glycolysis pathway only for fructose (Supplementary Fig. S1). Fructose could be taken in by a phosphotransferase system (PTS) for fructose and fed into glycolysis followed by production of acetate as a major end product. However, PTS genes for glucose, maltose, mannose, glucitol, cellobiose, and lactose were absent in the F. magna genome. PTS for mannitol, galactitol, and sucrose were incomplete.The tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle of F. magna ATCC 29328 was incomplete; only the step from pyruvate to fumarate was present (Supplementary Fig. S1). Similarly, incompleteness of the TCA cycle in clostridia such as C. tetani, C. acetobutylicum, and C. perfringens also has been reported.20–22F. magna ATCC 29328 has only gene sets for the production of acetate (and ethanol); although clostridia have complete gene sets for production of butyrate, acetate, lactate, and ethanol.20–22We also constructed a metabolic map of amino acid degradation to investigate which amino acids are used for energy acquisition in F. magna (Supplementary Fig. S1). The metabolic map showed that F. magna ATCC 29328 converts at least five amino acids (glycine, serine, threonine, aspartate, and asparagine) into pyruvate, and produces acetate and ATP. The metabolic map also showed that three (glycine, serine, and threonine) out of the five amino acids lead to NH3 production. As to amino acid biosynthesis pathways, F. magna ATCC 29328 has the complete gene sets required for biosynthesis of only five amino acids (glycine, serine, threonine, aspartate, and asparagine), suggesting that many of amino acids must be taken in from the environment (Supplementary Fig. S1). F. magna ATCC 29328 has many amino acid/oligopeptide transporters, enabling it to utilize amino acids as a major energy source by taking amino acids from the environment. As reported previously, F. magna has more aminopeptidase activities than other GPAC species.30 Bacterial aminopeptidases are generally regarded as a tissue-degrading enzyme and bacteria can utilize the degradation products as a nutrient source. In F. magna ATCC 29328 genome, four carboxypeptidase genes and six aminopeptidase genes including a Xaa-Pro aminopeptidase gene were found. These peptidase genes may contribute to bacterial growth and could account for higher pathogenicity of F. magna in GPAC.Finegoldia magna ATCC 29328 has at least 249 transport-related genes, accounting for 15.3% of the total ORFs. Of them, 49 ATP-binding cassette transporter systems (ABC transporters) could be identified on the basis of the similarities with ABC transporters from E. coli, Bacillus subtilis, and Mycobacterium tuberculosis.32–34 These ABC transporters were divided into 14 importers (e.g., amino acid/oligopeptide importers) and 35 exporters (e.g., putative multidrug exporters) (Supplementary Fig. S1). We also found other types of transporters such as electron, ion, a fructose-specific PTS, amino acid/oligopeptide, and multidrug-efflux transporters. Finegoldia magna has two vacuolar (V)-type ATPases (one is similar to an ATPase of C. tetani and another is similar to that of Fusobacterium nucleatum), but it has no F0F1-type ATPase.3.3. Regulation and stress responsesTranscriptional and translational regulators, and stress responses of F. magna are poorly understood. Finegoldia magna ATCC 29328 has an RNA polymerase core enzyme (composed of RpoA, RpoB, RpoC, and RpoZ subunits), a major sigma factor, and two general stress sigma factors, but it has no an ECF-type sigma factor,35,36 which has been found in several Gram-positive bacteria. Finegoldia magna encodes 12 two-component regulator systems consisting of 13 sensor histidine kinases and 12 response regulators. An autoinducer-2 production protein LuxS related to a quorum-sensing system was encoded in the chromosome. The F. magna genome encodes no superoxide dismutase gene, but encodes genes for superoxide reductase, NADH oxidase, and putative NADH dehydrogenase. These genes may play a major role in enabling the organism to survive in intermediate aerobic conditions, such as mucosa and skin.3.4. Virulence factorsPutative virulence factors were screened from all ORFs of F. magna ATCC 29328 genome by BLAST, SignalP, PSORT, and Pfam analyses. We found some putative virulence-related proteins with signal sequences and characteristic motifs (Supplementary Table S1). Interestingly, the F. magna ATCC 29328 genome encodes the following four albumin-binding protein homologs: three (FMG_1501, FMG_1517, and FMG_1523) in the chromosome and one (FMGP_0118) in the plasmid. These four proteins have regions similar to the albumin-binding modules (GA module)6,37,38 in PAB and urPAB proteins derived from F. magna ALB8 and ALB1B strains, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2). These GA modules were also found in protein G from group C and G streptococci and in the protein L-like molecule from F. magna strain 3316.39,40Other virulence factors, except albumin-binding protein and protein L, have not been well studied in F. magna. In the ATCC 29328 genome, we found ten collagen adhesion protein homologs (Supplementary Table S1). These proteins possess several domains similar to the B-type domain (Pfam accession PF05738) in a collagen adhesion protein (Cna) derived from Staphylococcus aureus.41 Furthermore, the ATCC 29328 genome encodes 20 N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase homologs (Cwp66 homologs) (Supplementary Table S1). These homologs have several putative cell wall binding repeat 2 (Pfam accession PF04122) motifs. The PF04122 motif is identified in autolysin and Cwp66, an adhesin of Clostridium difficile.42 The Cwp66 has been suggested as a multifunctional protein42; the C-terminal domain of Cwp66 gave partial adherence ability of C. difficile to host cells, the N-terminal domain has homology to some autolysins and could contribute to autolysis. We are interested in whether Cwp66 homologs of F. magna can act as adhesins to host cells, since the Cwp66 of C. difficile has partial adherence ability and are regarded as a virulence factor. Moreover, the ATCC 29328 genome encodes putative virulence factors such as a cell wall-associated serine proteinase precursor (FMG_0035) and a putative biofilm-associated surface protein (FMG_1333) (Supplementary Table S1).Taken together, the pathogenic F. magna ATCC 29328 has several antiphagocytotic proteins such as albumin-binding proteins, and multiple putative host cell adhesins such as collagen adhesion proteins and Cwp66 homologs. Although the functions of these adhesins are not yet understood, future studies should disclose the mechanisms of virulence and the significance of F. magna as a member of the normal human flora.An extracellular transpeptidase, sortase, catalyzes cell wall anchoring of surface proteins by cleaving the threonine and glycine residues of conserved LPXTG-like motif.43–46 Sortases (SrtA, SrtB) from Staphylococcus aureus were identified first and have been well studied recently.47,48 Since some pathogens deficient in sortases exhibit reduced virulence, much interest has been focussed on sortase as a target for new antimicrobial agents.43–46 Recently, Comfort and Clubb identified sortases and their substrates (surface proteins with the LPXTG-like motif) in silico from 241 bacterial chromosomes (96 species) sequenced completely, and they predicted some functional sortase–substrate linkages.26 By the same method with Comfort, we identified sortases and their substrates from the ATCC 29328 genome and several Gram-positive bacterial genomes.The ATCC 29328 chromosome encoded four sortase homologs and 19 putative substrates (Figs. 1 and 2A and Table 2; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). These 19 putative substrates include two albumin-binding protein homologs (FMG_1517 and FMG_1523) and putative biofilm-associated surface protein (FMG_1333), which may act as virulence factor (Table 2; Supplementary Tables S1 and S3). Most interestingly, seven sortase homologs and seven substrates were identified from the plasmid pPEP1 (Figs. 1 and 2B and Table 2; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). These seven substrates include an albumin-binding protein homolog (FMG_P0118) and four putative collagen adhesion proteins (FMG_P0123, FMG_P0125, FMG_P0146, and FMG_P0149) (Table 2; Supplementary Tables S1 and S3).Sortase homologs and substrates identified in silico from Gram-positive bacterial genomes.

From the ATCC 29328 genome, we predicted some linkage among two sortases (FMG_0189 and FMG_0190) and two substrates (FMG_0187 and FMG_0188), because these four ORFs belong to a common family (Family 3 defined by Comfort) and are located on one cluster in the chromosome (Table 2; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). The remaining sortases and substrates of F. magna were assigned to an unclassified family (defined by Comfort), and their sortase–substrate linkages could not be predicted. Assuming that an unclassified substrate and its sortase in a common genomic cluster may have some functional linkage,26 eight out of the 24 unclassified substrates can be linked to their specific sortases (Table 2; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). These predicted sortase–substrate linkages on the genome should be further elucidated experimentally. For example, if we can identify a sortase that specifically recognize the LPKAG motif in albumin-binding proteins, it will lead to the development of sortase inhibitors as new antimicrobial agents.43To our knowledge, the pPEP1 plasmid may have the largest number of sortase genes among Gram-positive bacterial plasmids analysed so far, because we searched sortases and their substrates in 29 plasmids of 14 Gram-positive bacterial species, except for F. magna, and found that no plasmids have a sortase gene, except for C. perfringens str.13 plasmid (pCP13) with a sortase gene (PCP56) (Fig. 2B; Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). We could not find a remarkable feature about the number of sortases and substrates among Gram-positive bacterial chromosomes (Fig. 2A). The presence of as many as seven sortase genes in a plasmid may be unique to F. magna, since there are no sortase genes even on the large plasmids of the following Gram-positive species: Bacillus anthracis pXO1 (181 677 bp), Bacillus cereus pBc10987 (208 369 bp), and C. acetobutylicum pSOL1 (192 000 bp).3.5. ConclusionsThis is the first report of a whole genome sequence of a member of any known GPAC. The sequence information presented and analysed here will contribute to an understanding of the taxonomy and pathogenicity of GPAC. The reason why F. magna is isolated most frequently and has the highest pathogenicity in GPAC may be due to the fact that F. magna genome encodes abundant aminopeptidases, multiple transporters and some virulence factors (e.g., albumin-binding proteins, Cwp66 homologs, and collagen adhesion proteins), beside with the limited capabilities of F. magna for sugar utilization and amino acid biosynthesis. It is of particular interest that four sortase genes were identified on the chromosome and that seven sortase genes were identified on the plasmid. Seven plasmid-encoded sortase genes unique to F. magna are of special interest, considering that plasmids are commonly considered to be of foreign origin. These mobile element-encoded sortases may play important roles in the pathogenesis of F. magna by enriching the variety of cell wall anchored surface proteins, which may enhance the interaction with host tissues and with other bacteria in mixed infection sites. Future studies, such as sortase–substrate linkage analyses and animal model experiments using sortase-negative mutant strains, will be required to clarify the roles of sortase on pathogenesis in F. magna.We thank T.

IntroductionIn higher eukaryotes, genes required for cellular function can comprise as little as 20% of the genome1,2 and occur in islands separated by repetitive DNA sequences,3,4 which comprise >70% of the genomes and are often referred to as junk DNA. With the advent of large-scale DNA sequencing, it has become apparent that transposable elements constitute a large proportion of the repetitive DNA component of most eukaryote genomes, e.g. at least 45% of the human genome5 and 50–80% of some grass genomes.6,7Transposable elements are divided into two major superfamilies, class I and class II, according to their mode of transposition.8 The class I elements can replicate by transcription of genomic copies followed by reverse transcription of an RNA intermediate and integration of the cDNA copy back into the genome.9 A representative class I element is the long-terminal repeat (LTR) retrotransposon, which has both structure and life-cycle similar to those of the retroviruses.2,10,11 LTR retrotransposons are ancient and ubiquitous; they are major components of plant genomes12–16 and are believed to be major contributors to plant genome evolution, as their replication strategy offers the potential for an explosive increase in copy number and for causing insertional genomic change.17,18A class II transposable element is mobilized by excision from one chromosomal location and reintegration elsewhere in the genome. The class II transposable elements are distinguished by terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) and are divided into three superfamilies—hAT, CACTA and MULU—on the basis of the homology of TIRs and transposase genes carrying out the cut-and-paste process. Transposons are widespread in plants,19,20 but quite low in copy numbers, ranging from tens to hundreds. However, an analysis of the growing database of genomic DNA sequences reveal that plant genomes harbor up to 30000 copies of miniature inverted-repeat terminal elements (MITEs) belonging to class II elements.21 MITEs have made important contributions to plant genome organization as well as LTR retrotransposons.22,23Widely distributed transposable elements are the most rapidly evolving fraction of the eukaryotic genome,24 because the methylated and heterochromatic state of most highly repetitive elements suffers from sequence change more readily than do genes.25,26 In general, the genomes of higher eukaryotes contain thousands, even millions, of seemingly inactive transposable elements, which have been suggested as a source of interspecific sequence divergence. Species-specific repetitive elements serve as genetic tools for developing DNA markers and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) entry points dispersed throughout the genome.27 As well as the development of molecular markers, active transposable elements, have been significant tools of reverse genetics for functional genomics. Their incorporation into the host genome enables insertional gene mutagenesis and gene tagging. In rice, reverse flow by the RNA of LTR retrotransposon Tos 17 yields mutant lines.28Ac (hAT) and Mutator (MULU) have been widely used for gene cloning.29Despite the vast DNA database that exists for higher eukaryotes, most genomic components are invisible and remain to be annotated, except for homologues of known class I and class II elements. We have sought novel active genomic components that might be useful as molecular tools. Among the Triticeae tribe, rye (Secale cereale) has been an important gene source, offering stress resistance useful for wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) and triticale breeding. The rye genome has a 1C DNA content of 3.9 Gb, the highest among the Triticeae, and repetitive sequences comprise 92% of the genome.30 Cot analysis estimates 24% of the rye genome to be rye-specific.1 Rye-specific repetitive sequences have been useful molecular probes for the determination of introgressed genomes and the genomic constitution of wheat–rye hybrids.31,32 However, active transposable elements have not been found in rye, wheat, or wheat relatives. One of the reasons may be that repetitive sequences were isolated mainly from relic DNA that has not suffered from methylation-sensitive restriction enzymes.33–35In this study, in order to obtain genome-specific elements regardless of the methylation state, we have used genomic deletion of sequences common to wheat and rye. Here, we describe a new class of transposon-like gene, called Revolver, consisting of 2929—3041 bp with TIRs and harboring a transcriptionally active single gene. Revolver exhibits structural diversities and considerable copy number variation through the evolution of the Triticeae, from 2 × 104 in rye to almost rare in wheat.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsThe plant materials used in this study included: the rye-inbred pure line IR130 developed at Tottori University (S. cereale L.; 2n = 2x = 14, RR); the wheat variety Chinese Spring (CS) (T. aestivum L.; 2n = 6x = 42); the rye IR130 chromosome 6R addition wheat CS line (6R add. wheat; 2n = 44).2.2. Genomic deletionThe deletion enrichment scheme36 was used to recover rye-specific DNA sequences from the genome of 6R add. wheat. Genomic DNA was extracted from fresh leaves by the cetyl trimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) method. The genomic DNA of 6R add. wheat was digested completely with the restriction enzyme MboI, while the wheat DNA was sheared randomly to 0.5 kb on average with a sonicator. Then, 13.4 µg of digested 6R add. wheat DNA was mixed with 67.0 µg of the sonicated wheat DNA and denatured by boiling for 10 min and then allowed to anneal at random in 4 mL of PERT reaction mixture (8% phenol, 1.25 M NaClO4, 0.12 M Na2HPO4) in a revolving flask for 72 h at room temperature. The objective was to recover rye-specific repetitive sequences that will anneal by themselves with cohesive ends adjusted to the vector's ends (Fig. 1). The genomic DNA of rye IR130 was digested completely, whereas that of wheat var. CS was sheared randomly with a sonicator. The MboI-digested rye DNA was mixed with the sonicated wheat DNA, denatured by boiling, and then allowed to anneal randomly. Rye-specific sequences that anneal by themselves with cohesive ends of cloning vectors were recovered. After extraction with phenol, the DNA solution was used to ligate with pUC119 linearized by BamHI, followed by transformation of Escherichia coli JM109.The scheme for cloning genome-specific elements by subtracting sequences common to wheat and rye. Genomic subtraction recovered a repetitive sequence, which is enriched in rye, but absent from wheat. Southern blot analysis of the EcoO109I digests confirmed that the rye 89 bp fragment (AB304276) hybridized well to the genome of rye (Secale cereale, S.vavillovi and S.montanum), but did not hybridize to the wheat genomic DNA. The full structure of the element was determined by sequencing positive genomic clones screened by the initial rye-specific probe.The scheme for cloning genome-specific elements by subtracting sequences common to wheat and rye.

Southern blot analysis of the EcoO109I digests confirmed that the rye 89 bp fragment (AB304276) hybridized well to the genome of rye (Secale cereale, S.vavillovi and S.montanum), but did not hybridize to the wheat genomic DNA. The full structure of the element was determined by sequencing positive genomic clones screened by the initial rye-specific probe.A total of 222 recombinant plasmids were isolated and 1 µg of each plasmid DNA was spotted onto two sheets of nylon membranes, which were hybridized for 3 h in 5× SSC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche), 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine, 0.02% SDS, and 1 µg/mL sheared pUC119 DNA. One membrane was probed with 5 ng of rye IR130 genomic DNA and the other was probed with 10 ng of wheat CS DNA, each labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP, for 14 h at 68°C, washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 5 min, and twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 68°C for 15 min. The hybridization signals were detected on X-ray films using as the chemiluminescent substrate a 25 mM solution of disodium 3-(4-methoxyspiro{1,2-dioxetane-3,2′-(5′-chloro)tricyclo [3.3.1.13,7] decan}-4-yl) phenyl phosphate (CSPD, Boehringer Mannheim Biochemica). From the differential blotting, 14 plasmid clones that hybridized strongly to rye DNA, but not wheat DNA, were screened. In this study, a single 89 bp sequence was used for further characterization.2.3. Phage library screening and DNA sequencingIn order to determine the full structure of the element harboring the 89 bp segment, approximately 5 × 104 plaques of a lambda FIX II library constructed from rye genomic DNA were screened with the cloned 89 bp fragment labeled with digoxigenin-dUTP. Positive plaques were detected with anti-dig-AP and CDP-star (Roche). Positive six lambda clones were chosen at random and restriction sites of BamHI and SacI were mapped on the six insertions. A 21.6 kb insertion of the three lambda clones carrying the 89 bp segment was subcloned into pBluescript and fully sequenced on both strands using the ALFexpress sequencer (Pharmacia Biotech). Overlapping fragments were assembled with the ALFexpress assembler software. Completed sequences were compared with the non-redundant GenBank+ EMBL + DDBJ database using BLASTN and BLASTX homology search software.2.4. RNA gel blot analysis and cDNA library constructionTotal RNA was extracted from young leaves of rye according to a modified guanidine isothiocyanate procedure and then treated with DNase I. Twenty micrograms of total RNA was electrophoresed in a 1.1% agarose/18% formamide gel and transferred to a nylon membrane. The membranes were prehybridized at 65°C for 4 h in hybridization solution containing 5 × Denhardt's, 10% dextran sulfate, 6× SSC and 0.2% SDS. A Revolver 1.5 kb probe (25 ng) excised from a genomic clone of lambda-1 and labeled with (α)32P-dCTP (Amersham) was added to the pre-hybridization solution and allowed to hybridize at 65°C for 14 h. Blots were washed in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 1 min and three times in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 20 min, then exposed to Fuji RX-U film. Polyadenylated mRNA was prepared from the rye leaf total RNA by affinity chromatography using an oligo(dT) column, and the first and second cDNA strands were synthesized for cloning into bacteriophage lambda ZAPII.2.5. Reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR)Plaque lifts from a rye leaf cDNA library constructed in lambda ZAPII were screened by a Revolver 1.5 kb probe excised from a genomic clone of lambda-1. The nucleotide sequence of a positive cDNA clone (726 bp) was determined by using its phagemid DNA as a cycle sequencing template. Total RNA for Reverse transcriptase–polymerase chain reaction (RT–PCR) extracted from seedlings was treated with DNase I. Single-strand cDNAs were synthesized by Avian Myeloblastosis virus (AMV) reverse transcriptase (Life Science) using an oligo(dT) primer. The primers for amplification of Revolver cDNA were designed from both ends of a positive cDNA clone. Reaction mixtures contained 10 ng of template cDNA, 50 pmol of each primer (5′-GGCACGAGGGTACGAGTCCGAG-3′, 5′-GGCACAACTCATGTAAAAGAGGG-3′), 0.4 mM dNTPs, 1 × LA PCR buffer II, 2.5 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 U of LA Taq polymerase (Takara) in a volume of 25 µl. The PCR reaction program consisted of 30 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at 63°C, 1 min at 72°C. The RT–PCR products were purified, ligated to the pGEM-T vector (Promega), and sequenced.CapFishingTM technology (Seegene), which employs the CapFishingTM adapter and the oligo(dT) primer, was used to obtain a full-length cDNA of Revolver. The single-strand cDNAs were synthesized from CapFishingTM adapter-added total RNA by SuperScript III reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen) using an oligo(dT) primer extended with 23 bp of 3′ Revolver sequence (5′-TTTTTTTTTTTTTTGGCACAACTCATGTAAAAGAGGG-3′). Because the CapFishingTM adapter (patent pending) binds to the CAP structure of the full-length mRNA, the 3′ end of the first-strand full-length cDNA was extended using the CapFishingTM adapter as template. Then, the PCR reaction for amplifying the Revolver-related full-length cDNA was carried out using the 5′ CapFishingTM adapter primer (5′-GTCTACCAGGCATTCGCTTCAT-3′) and the 3′ Revolver primer (5′-GGCACAACTCATGTAAAAGAGGG-3′) in a 30 µl mixture including 5 µl of the single-strand cDNA solution, 0.3 µM of each primer, 0.4 mM dNTPs, 1 × LA PCR buffer II, 2.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 U of LA Taq polymerase (Takara). The cycling profile was: 35 cycles at 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, 72°C for 2 min. The double-strand cDNA products were TA-cloned and sequenced.2.6. PCRThe primers for amplification of Revolver genomic DNA were designed from both ends of Revolver-2 in lambda-2. Reaction mixtures contained 10 ng of template genomic DNA, 50 pmol of each primer (5′-GCCTTTCGGCCTTCCTCTCAGGCGG-3′, 5′-GTAGTCGTCAGGAGTCCTCACCA-3′), 0.4 mM dNTPs, 1 × LA PCR buffer II, 2.5 mM MgCl2 and 0.5 U of LA Taq polymerase (Takara) in a volume of 50 µl. The PCR reaction program consisted of 30 cycles of 30 s at 95°C, 1 min at 70°C, 3 min at 72°C. The PCR products were purified, ligated to the pGEM-T vector (Promega), and sequenced.2.7. DNA gel blot analysisGenomic DNA (10 µg) of Triticum aestivum (AABBDD), Triticum dicoccum (AABB), Triticum monococcum (AA), Aegilops speltoides (SS), Aegilops tauschii (DD), Dasypyrum villosum (VV), Secale cereale, Secale vavillovi, Secale silvestre, Secale montanum, Secale fragile (RR) and X Triticosecale (AABBRR) were digested to completion with restriction enzymes, subjected to electrophoresis in a 1% agarose gel, then transferred, and crosslinked to nylon membranes. The membranes were pre-hybridized at 65°C for 3 h in hybridization solution containing 5× SSC, 2% blocking reagent (Roche), 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine and 0.02% SDS. A Revolver cDNA probe (pSc5, 693 bp, 25 ng) labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP was added to the pre-hybridization solution and allowed to hybridize at 65°C for 14 h. Blots were washed twice in 2× SSC, 0.1% SDS at room temperature for 5 min and twice in 0.1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 65°C for 15 min, then exposed to Kodak X-OMAT film using CDP-star.2.8. Slot blot analysisFor slot blot analysis, genomic DNA from wheat and wheat relatives was blotted onto hybond N+ membranes (Amersham). The non-radioactive chemiluminescence method (Gene Images, Amersham) was used for probe labeling, hybridization, and detection of hybridization sites. The Revolver cDNA sequences (pSc5, 693 bp) were used as a probe. The membranes were hybridized at 60°C for 30 min in hybridization buffer and then hybridized with labeled probes at 60°C overnight. The membranes were washed in 1× SSC, 0.1% SDS at 60°C for 15 min, then in 0.5× SSC, 0.1% SDS for 15 min, followed by incubation for 60 min at room temperature in 10% (W/V) blocking reagent in antibody wash buffer. Then the membrane was incubated in the presence of anti-fluorescein antibody-alkaline phosphatase (AP) conjugate. Unbound conjugate was removed by three washes in 0.3% (V/V) Tween 20 in antibody wash buffer at room temperature. Hybridization sites were detected using the CDP-star detection reagent. Decomposition of the stabilized dioxetane was catalyzed by probe-bound AP, and the light emitter was exposed on X-ray film and then recorded by a fluoro-image analyzer (FUJIFILM FLA-2000). The copy number of the Revolver probe was determined by quantitative slot blot hybridization to a series of measured amounts of Revolver cDNA.2.9. DNA:DNA in situ hybridizationRye chromosomes were prepared from root tip meristems of germinating seeds, which were cut off and placed into distilled water at 0°C for 24 h. After fixation in ethanol:glacial acetic acid (3:1, V/V) for 24 h and three washes with water, the root tips were digested for 30 min in an enzyme solution consisting of 1% pectolyase and 2% cellulase Onozuka RS in 75 mM KCl, 7.5 mM EDTA at pH 4.5. The root tips were washed with water and squashed in 45% acetic acid on glass microscope slides. After removal of the coverslip, the slides were frozen on dry ice, treated with RNase A, dehydrated through an ethanol series, and dried. Revolver cDNA was labeled with biotin-16-dUTP by PCR. The subtelomeric repetitive DNA probe was labeled with digoxigenin-11-dUTP (Boehringer Mannheim). Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and signal detection were performed as described by Heslop-Harrison et al.37A 15 µM portion of the hybridization mixture containing 50% (V/V) formamide in 2× SSC, 1 µg/mL probe DNA, and 100 µg/mL salmon sperm DNA was covered with a 22 × 30 mm2 coverslip, sealed by a rubber solution, and put on a thermal cycler (PHC-3 Techne) programmed for denaturing DNA at 82°C for 8 min; and in situ hybridization at 37°C for 18 h. The preparations were then washed four times at 40°C for 10 min each time, three times in 2× SSC and once in 4× SSC, then blocked with 5% (W/V) BSA in 0.05% (V/V) Tween 20, 0.1 M NaHCO3 at 37°C for 5 min. The probes were detected with 10% (V/V) avidin-FITC and 10% (V/V) anti-dig-rhodamine (Boehringer Mannheim) in a humid chamber at 38°C for 1 h. After three washes in 0.05% (V/V) Tween 20, 0.1 M NaHCO3 and one wash in 2× SSC at 40°C (10 min each wash), the preparations were counter-stained with a mixture of 3 µg/mL DAPI (Boehringer Mannheim) and 10% (V/V) antifade (Oncor) in glycerol. The preparations were observed with a light microscope (OLYMPUS BX4), and the fluorochrome signals were visualized.3. Results and discussion3.1. Structure of dispersed transposon-like element Revolver recovered by deletionA rye genome-specific DNA library was constructed by the deletion of sequences common to wheat and rye (Fig. 1). From this library, 222 plasmid DNAs were screened by differential dot hybridization, and 14 clones hybridized strongly to rye DNA, but did not hybridize to wheat DNA. Among them, seven clones belong to the tandem 350 bp family33,34 and one clone belongs to the dispersed R173 family,38,39 both of which are rye-specific repetitive sequences. On the other hand, a single clone contained an 89 bp unknown sequence (AB304276). These results indicate that deletion of sequences common to wheat and rye was effective, and the 89 bp sequence was used for further characterization.Southern blot analysis confirmed that the rye 89 bp fragment hybridized well to the genome of S. cereale, S. vavillovi, and S. montanum, but did not hybridize to the wheat genomic DNA (Fig. 1). Therefore, the 89 bp segment is derived from a repetitive sequence family dispersed specifically in the R genome of the genus Secale. A strongly hybridized 1.5 kb band was observed on the SacI digest(data not shown), indicating that the repetitive sequences commonly contain a 1.5 kb sequence, and that the full structure is more than 1.5 kb long. In order to determine the full sequence of the repetitive element harboring the 89 bp fragment, a rye genomic library constructed in lambda FIX (Stratagene) was screened by the 89 bp probe. The plaque hybridization analysis found approximately 800 positive plaques for the membranes of 5 × 104 plaques of the rye genomic DNA library. Six positive lambda clones were chosen at random, and the restriction sites of BamHI and SacI were mapped differently on the six insertions, which are, therefore, derived from different areas of the rye genome.Three lambda clones were sequenced in full. Two lambda clones, which are 92% identical, included the full structure of the repetitive element harboring the 89 bp segment, the one in lambda-1 is 3041 bp long and the one in lambda-2 is 2929 bp long (in accession nos. AB124639–124640). The regions flanking the 3 kb elements do not show any homology between the two lambda clones. The consensus sequence contains 20 bp of incomplete TIRs on both ends (5′-TGTgAcGCCCgaGAccGACg-3′, 5′-TGTaAtGCCCagGAtggGAC-3′) and subterminal short repeat sequences on the 5′ end (5′-TCCAGAAGAT-3′). The transposable element includes TIRs and often also sequence motifs in the subterminal regions. The 3 kb elements are insertions flanked by 2 bp repeats, TC in lambda-1, and AG in lambda-2, which may be terminal sequence duplications. As shown in Fig. 2, a FISH experiment probed by the 3041 bp sequence in lambda-1 showed that the 3 kb insertion is dispersed on the seven chromosomes of rye. These findings indicate that a transposon-like 3 kb element is dispersed throughout the rye genome.The transposon-like gene Revolver is dispersed on all seven chromosomes of rye. A FISH experiment was conducted using dual probes of Revolver labeled by biotin-16-dUTP and the subtelomeric 350 bp family labeled by digoxigenin-11-dUTP. Each probe was visualized by avidin-FITC (blue color) and anti-dig-rhodamine (red color), respectively.The transposon-like gene Revolver is dispersed on all seven chromosomes of rye.

Each probe was visualized by avidin-FITC (blue color) and anti-dig-rhodamine (red color), respectively.Despite extensive characterization of the repetitive elements in the rye genome, the 3 kb element does not show similarity to any known rye repetitive element: the 350 bp family,33,34 the 120 bp family,33,40 the 5.3H3 family,35 the R173 family,38,39 or pSc250.41 The entire structure of the 3 kb transposon-like element does not share whole identity with class I or class II transposable elements. We have named the novel transposon-like element Revolver.3.2. Identification of Revolver mRNANorthern analysis showed that Revolver is expressed extensively in rye, but there is no transcript in wheat (Fig. 3A). Weak transcripts are observed in a rye-chromosome-translocated wheat line. A Revolver cDNA clone was identified from a leaf cDNA library by the 3 kb Revolver probe. A positive rye cDNA, entirely 80% identical, is 726 bp long (AB124665). By using cap site-specific cloning method, a single size of cDNA (0.7 kb) was amplified. The obtained full-length cDNA of Revolver, 728 bp long (AB124666), shows 94% identity with the positive cDNA. Nucleotide sequence comparison between the 3 kb Revolver genomic DNAs (Revolver-1 in lambda-1 and Revolver-2 in lambda-2) and the cDNAs revealed that the Revolver element consists of three exons of 342, 88, and 292 bp, and two introns of 750 and 1237 bp (Fig. 3B). Splice acceptor and donor sites certainly exist in the exon–intron junctions. A putative TATA box is located at base 221, with a cap site at base 261 and a possible polyadenylation signal AATAAA at base 2918. Therefore, Revolver harbors a single gene consisting of three exons and the initial 89 bp clone obtained by genomic subtraction is located around the second exon (Fig. 3B).Identification of Revolver mRNA. (A) Multiple sizes of transcripts homologous to Revolver were found in rye but no transcript was found in wheat. (B) A full-length Revolver cDNA clone (AB124665–124666), 726 bp long, was identified. Nucleotide sequence comparison between Revolver and the cDNA revealed that Revolver includes a single gene consisting of three exons and two introns. The predicted 139 amino acid sequence is highly conserved in Revolver cDNAs (AB124645, AB124666, AB304271–304275), which are recovered from S. cereale, S. silvestre, D. villosum, and Ae. tauschii, indicating activity in all of these species. The ORF shows similarity to some DNA-binding proteins. The Revolver ORF includes a DDE motif. The initial 89 bp clone (AB304276) obtained by genomic subtraction corresponds to the second exon. Revolver (AB124639, AB124640) shows 60% homology to parts of both ends (5′ side 104 bp, 3′ side 2213 bp) of LARD (4327 bp), however, in which the region extending from exon 1 to the half of intron 1 of Revolver is replaced by a different sequence and the coding region is not present.Identification of Revolver mRNA.

These Revolver cDNAs (AB124645, AB124666, AB304271–AB304275) contain a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding 139 amino acid residues of protein (Fig. 3). The ORF does not show homology to known transposases; however, the predicted Revolver product shows similarity to a transcriptional regulator family of AsnC/Lrp or a glycerol-3-phosphate transporter and includes a DDE motif (Fig. 3 and 4). Because of the presence of terminal inverted repeats and encoding a DNA-binding-like protein, Revolver is considered to be a class II transposable element. The inverted repeated sequences determining the family identity of a transposon and the encoding gene are unique sequences that are quite different from known class II transposons. Moreover, the entire structure of Revolver does not share whole identity with either class I or class II autonomous transposable elements.Revolver cDNAs isolated by RT–PCR from S. cereale, S. silvestre, S. fragile, D. villosum, Ae. tauschii, and T. monococcum (AB124645, AB304271–304275). Wheat and barley ESTs showing partial homology to Revolver were found in the Triticeae EST database. The predicted Revolver ORF shows similarity to some transcriptional regulators with DNA-binding ability. The ORF is highly conserved among the top four species, indicating that Revolver is active in these species. In wheat and barley, however, only partial sequences encoded in exon 2 are retained.Revolver cDNAs isolated by RT–PCR from S. cereale, S. silvestre, S. fragile, D. villosum, Ae. tauschii, and T. monococcum (AB124645, AB304271–304275).

In wheat and barley, however, only partial sequences encoded in exon 2 are retained.The Ty1-copia group retrotransposon is a major component of plant genomes.12,27BARE-1, one of the Ty1-copia retrotransposons,42,43 is dispersed and transcribed in the genome of barley Hordeum vulgare.44,45Revolver is quite different from retrotransposons, although it shows partial homology (60%) to both end regions (5′ end 123 bp, 3′ end 777–2112 bp) of LARD LTR (3130–4960 bp), one of which is found as a nested insertion in the 3′ LTR of BARE-142 and is regarded as solo LTRs of the non-autonomous retorotransposon elements named LARD (large retrotransposon derivative) in barley.46 The two sequences of 5 kb were found to be similar to this insertion in a 66 kb stretch of the barley genome and were described as an LTR of LARD.46,47 The LARD LTRs include the region homologous to both 5′ and 3′ ends of the Revolver element (Fig. 3B). At the 5′ terminus, LARD LTRs have the region of 123–149 bp homologous to upstream of the transcription initiation site of Revolver. At the 3′ terminus, LARD LTR-1 (4960 bp) has a region of 2112 bp showing 60% homology to Revolver, from the middle of the first intron to the 3′ terminus of Revolver. Another LARD LTR nested in BARE-1 has a region of 777 bp showing 60% homology to the middle of the second intron to downstream of the third exon. Both 3′ termini coincide with the 3′ terminus of the untranslated region downstream of the third exon of Revolver. However, no homology to Revolver was observed in 631–2176 bp of LARD LTR-1 or 598–2353 bp of LARD LTR nested in BARE-1. As to the region of about 2 kb between these end regions, LARD LTRs lack the region from the first exon to the middle of the first intron. Moreover, the central regions of LARD LTRs are highly variable, except for the 5′ and 3′ ends,46 but Revolver is entirely conserved. LARD LTRs have sequences not present in Revolver; instead by the first exons of Revolver and result in non-coding sequences. Revolver and LARD LTR may be evolutionally related, but LARD LTR is a structural part of an LTR retrotransposon, and on the contrary, Revolver is a single gene consisting of the exon–intron structure. Gene-encoding LTR has never been found. Therefore, Revolver is quite distinguished from LARD LTRs, in which the exons 1 and 2 of Revolver are replaced by different sequences and the coding region is not present, and whose autonomous element has never been reported. The presence of a Revolver-like element in barley suggests a wide prevalence of Revolver among the Triticeae.The novel high-copy element Revolver is transcriptionally active in rye. Some of transposon-like elements exist in high copy numbers in the genomes of most eukaryotes, but the great majority of them are inactive, and only a small portion of them retain the ability to transpose.48,49 Very few transposons have been shown to be transcriptionally active. A copia-like retroelement BARE-1 dispersed in the barley genome43 is transcribed in somatic tissues.44 Some LTR retrotransposons, such as tobacco Tnt1, Tto1, and OARE-1 that are largely inactive, can be transcriptionally activated under the conditions of biotic and abiotic stress, including wounding, oxidative stress, and pathogen infection.50,51 After stress-induced transcription, the rice LTR retrotransposon Tos17 increased the genomic copy number.52 In maize, a survey of more than 4 × 105 expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences identified only 56 retrotransposon cDNAs, supporting the notion that most retrotransposons are inactive.7 Furthermore, most of these sequences are derived from the low-to-middle repetitive LTR retrotransposons, and not from the very high copy number elements that have been responsible for doubling the size of the maize genome in the past 5–6 million years. In humans, only 30–60 L1 elements out of 5 × 105 comprising 45% of the genome are thought to be active.53 In contrast to the low-level activity of high-copy retrotransposons, highly repetitive Revolver is transcribed strongly and may retain mobility and mutagenetic potential.A transcriptionally active Revolver gene is well conserved among the Triticeae members. The methylated and heterochromatic state of most transposons can cause them to change sequence more rapidly than the genes.25,26 For example, regulation at any stage of the replication cycle for retrotransposons (transcription, translation, reverse transcription, and integration of element cDNA) can limit the transposition. Furthermore, the paucity of maize retrotransposon-derived ESTs indicates that some epigenetic mechanisms might have been repressing the transcription of their large fraction in the genome. In contrast to these silenced retrotransposons, Revolver is transcriptionally active, and short RNA homologues causing RNAi silencing54–56 were not observed on Northern blots (Fig. 3A). Revolver has not suffered from epigenetical silencing systems and might has retained strong transcriptional activity during the long evolution of the Triticeae.3.3. Structural diversities of Revolver in the rye genomePolymerase chain reaction was performed using the primer derived from one clone of Revolver (Revolver-2). Several sizes of Revolver variants ranging from 2665 to 4269 bp were amplified from the rye genome, but nothing was amplified from the wheat genome. All of the lengthy variants may be non-autonomous elements of Revolver, because they have the downstream region of second intron of Revolver, but they have structural mutation occurred at the 5′-side, in which the coding regions, especially in the first exon, are considerably destructed (Fig. 5).Structural diversities of Revolver in the rye genome. Several sizes of Revolver variants ranging from 2665 to 4269 bp (Revolver-3–6, AB124641–12464) were obtained from the rye genome. All of the lengthy variants may be non-autonomous elements of Revolver, because they have the downstream region of second intron of Revolver, but they have structural mutation occurred at the 5′ side, in which the coding region especially in the first exon is considerably destructed. Among the Revolver family showing extremely structural diversities, Revolver-1 (3041 bp) in lambda-1 and Revolver-2 (2929 bp) in lambda-2, which indicates the highest coincidence with a full-length cDNA of 728 bp, should have basic structure of Revolver.Structural diversities of Revolver in the rye genome.

At the 5′ side, Revolver-3 has the homologous region of 150 bp including the inverted repeat sequence. However, as to the region of about 2 kb between these sequences, Revolver-3 lacks the region from the first exon to the middle of the first intron of Revolver. In the region from 631 to 2176 bp at the 5′ side of Revolver-3, there exist short repetitive sequences occurring repeatedly, but no homology was observed with Revolver. Referring to the homology with Revolver of each region, Revolver-3 exhibited homology from 77 to 93%.Distribution of Revolver in plant genomes as revealed by genomic Southern blotting. Revolver cDNA hybridized strongly to Secale species and moderately to T. monococcum (AA), Ae. speltoides (SS), Ae. tauschii (DD), and T. dicoccum (AABB). In contrast, Revolver was not detected in the common wheat genome. These facts indicate that Revolver has existed since the diploid progenitor of wheat (3000–8000 copies), and it has been amplified in rye (20 000 copies), but it has been lost from bread wheat after the allopolyploidy event.Distribution of Revolver in plant genomes as revealed by genomic Southern blotting.

These facts indicate that Revolver has existed since the diploid progenitor of wheat (3000–8000 copies), and it has been amplified in rye (20 000 copies), but it has been lost from bread wheat after the allopolyploidy event.Next, the total length of Revolver-4 (AB124642) consists of 3219 bp (Fig. 5), and at the 3′ side, it has the region of 1806 bp from the second exon to the 3′ terminal of Revolver. However, in the 1413 bp at the 5′ side, the region homologous to Revolver is limited to only 101 bp at the 5′ terminal. Further, Revolver-5 (AB124643) has a total length of 2665 bp (Fig. 5), and at the 3′ side, it has the region of 1826 bp from the second exon to the 3′ terminal of Revolver. At its 5′ side, the region homologous to Revolver is limited to only 37 bp at the terminal region, but the region of about 670 bp is homologous to Revolver-4. Finally, Revolver-6 (AB124644) has a total length of 3503 bp (Fig. 5), and at the 3′ side it has the region of 1294 bp from the middle of the second intron to the 3′ terminal of Revolver; however, at the 5′ side there is not a region homologous to Revolver, and 121 bp at the 5′ terminal is homologous to Revolver-4 and Revolver-5.Revolver shows extremely structural diversities, especially around the first exon. Among them since Revolver-1 in lambda-1 and Revolver-2 in lambda-2 show the highest correspondence with a full-length cDNA of 728 bp, they should be basic structure of Revolver, despite the not so high homology of the first exon. Multiple transcripts longer than 0.7 kb RNA fragment (Fig. 3A) may be unspliced versions of several lengthy variants or a read-through transcript from an external promoter. The major 3 kb transcripts may be unspliced immature transcripts, which are caused by structural degeneration in 5′ region around the first exon. It suggests that such variants are prevalent than the normal spliced transcripts.3.4. Amplification and elimination of Revolver in the Triticeae genomeThe distribution of Revolver in the Triticeae was analyzed by Southern blotting. As shown in Fig. 6, the Revolver cDNA probe hybridized strongly to gel blots of the wheat relatives Secale sp. (RR), D. villosum (VV), and moderately to wheat ancestral species T. monococcum (AA), Ae. speltoides (SS), T. dicoccum (AABB), and Ae. tauschii (DD). These cereals may share a large superfamily of Revolver stemming from their common progenitor. On the contrary, Revolver cDNA did not show hybridization to T. aestivum genomic DNA (Fig. 6). DNA slot blot analysis also shows that Revolver elements are abundant in the genomes of Secale sp. (RR) and D. villosum (VV) (over 104 copies), and Revolver is present with moderate repeats in the wheat ancestral species T. monococcum (AA), T. dicoccum (AABB) and Ae. tauschii (DD) (3 × 103 − 8 × 103 copies), but very rare in bread wheat (103 copies). While these facts indicate that Revolver has existed since the diploid progenitor of wheat and been amplified in rye and some other species, it has been lost from bread wheat through evolution accompanied by hexaploidization. Revolver exhibits quantitative variation during evolution of the Triticeae.The rye haploid genome contains 3.9 Gb of DNA and is the largest among the Triticeae genomes. Highly repetitive Revolver was visualized over the entire length of rye chromosomes by a FISH experiment (Fig. 2). The copy number of Revolver was calculated by slot blot hybridization with a Revolver probe as 2 × 104 per rye genome, but only 103 copies in the wheat genome. Generally, angiosperm genomes vary tremendously in size; some species have less than 50 Mb of DNA per haploid genome and others have more than 85 000 Mb.57 The lack of correlation between the complexity of the organism and the size of the genome has long been recognized as a C value paradox.58 There is great variability in genome size among the grass family Poaceae: 450 Mb for rice, 2500 Mb for maize, 5000 Mb for barley, and 16 000 Mb for hexaploid wheat.59 Most of the variation in genome size is attributable mainly to the amount of repetitive DNA, which comprises 70% of cereal genomes.1,3 Cot analysis estimated that repetitive sequences comprise 92% of the rye genome,30 and 24% of them were differentiated in a rye-specific array.1 The considerable accumulation of Revolver may be a reason why the rye genome became so enlarged when compared to other members of the Triticeae. If Revolver is a mobile element, it is reasonable that as many as 2 × 104 copies of the family have been generated and spread throughout the rye genome since the evolutionary event that separated rye and wheat. The considerable variation of Revolver copy number among the wheat-related species indicates their propagation activity during evolution of the Triticeae tribe. The name of the novel transposon-like gene Revolver means a dynamic factor to construct genomes through evolution of the Triticeae.Among the repetitive DNA, especially the LTR retrotransposons, the copy number has increased,60,61 and repetitive DNA comprises 60% or more of many large plant genomes, such as those of maize (Zea mays), wheat, and barley,6,7,45,62 which has contributed greatly to the expansion of the genome.5,17,63,64 Over a broad range of organisms, retrotransposon copy number appears to be correlated with genome size. The small genome of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (13 × 106 bp) contains 51 full-length retrotransposons.65 In the large genome of maize (2500 Mb), some retrotransposons have copy numbers exceeding 2 × 104 per haploid genome6,62,63,66 and all of the retrotransposons sequenced were shown to have inserted within the last six million years, leading to a doubling of the size of the maize genome.26Revolver is quite different from LTR retrotransposons and features a DNA-type transposable element. The copy number of the DNA-type transposable element is generally less than those of the highly repetitive retrotransposons, but recent analysis of the growing genomic database revealed that plant genomes harbor a huge copy of DNA-type transposable elements termed MITEs.21,23 The plant genome could also be expanded by the class II element MITE.67,68 The DNA-type transposon-like gene Revolver is a novel member of a major genomic component, as well as LTR retrotransposons and MITEs, which might have contributed to plant genome construction and evolution.Revolver is less frequent in the genome of hexaploid bread wheat (T. aestivum; 2n = 42, AABBDD), which is an allohexaploid carrying three different subgenomes, A, B, and D69 resulting from two independent hybridization events (Fig. 6). The first combined the A genome of the wild diploid wheat T. monococcum (AA) and the B genome, which has the greatest genetic similarity to the S genome of Ae. speltoides.70–72 This resulted in the tetraploid ancestor of modern Triticum species T. dicoccum and Ae. tauschii, the diploid donor of the D genome hybridized over 8000 years ago, resulting in hexaploid wheat.73Revolver existed in the wheat ancestral species, T. monococcum (AA), T. dicoccum (AABB), and Ae. tauschii (DD) (3–8 × 103 copies). However, it is considerably less frequent in T. aestivum (103 copies). The polyploidy that arise either by duplication of a single genome or by the acquisition of a few genomes from related species (allopolyploidy) is a major force in the evolution of plants; 50–70% of angiosperms have experienced at least one episode of polyploidy in their history.74,75 The combination of A, B and, D genomes into a single nucleus may generate more incompatibility than harmony for the propagation of some genes.76–78Revolver contains a single ORF encoding a 139 amino acid residue protein, which features a transcriptional regulator able to bind DNA, suggesting that the Revolver element can transpose in a cut-and-paste fashion, like class II elements. In wheat, no transcript of the Revolver gene is observed on the Northern blot (Fig. 3A) and no Revolver cDNA is recovered by RT–PCR. A EST homologue is highly degenerated from the obtained cDNAs of other wheat-related species (Fig. 4). Revolver may have been eliminated from the wheat genome because of losing the gene activity needed to reintegrate into the host wheat genome after that polyploidy induced incompatibility among the three genomes.As well as a history of genome expansion, flowering plants appear to have undergone genome contraction.79–81 One possible mechanism that reduces genome size is unequal intrastrand recombination between the two tandem repeats in direct orientation on the same chromatid. The outcome of the event can yield the net deletion of one repeat and the sequences between the repeats. Unequal intrastrand recombination between adjacent LTR retrotransposons might lead to a decrease in the size of a genome, a phenomenon that is supported by the abundance of solo LTRs and the general absence of the LTR–internal-LTR structure.79 Deletions of retrotransposons are more common in insects.82 Highly saturated Revolver in the wheat polyploid genome can offer unequal intrastrand recombination, and recombination between adjacent Revolver elements might have reduced the copy number in the wheat genome. The considerably destructive variants of Revolver (Fig. 5) may be stemmed from unequal recombination.Revolver is enriched in the genomes of wild wheat relatives but rare in the common wheat genome. A cultivated rye (S. cereale L.) has been used as a gene source for wheat and triticale breeding by interspecific chromosome introgression and rearrangement or by translocation or substitution. A representative achievement of this type of manipulation is the introduction of a stem rust resistance gene into wheat. The rye genome still has a gene resource potential for future improvement of wheat. Rye-specific repeated sequences have been useful as probes to determine alien chromatins and chromosome constitutions in wheat–rye cross-breeding.31,32Revolver is an effective tool for developing molecular tags for transferring useful germplasm of wheat relatives, rye, and Dasypyrum into the wheat genome. Revolver offer FISH, Southern probe for genotyping, and dispersed PCR entry points to amplify rye-specific multiple genomic fragments.83Revolver is attractive as an index of genomic evolution and as a landmark of chromosomes useful for evaluating evolutionary relationships among the tribe Triticeae.In conclusion, genomic deletion cloning led to the discovery of Revolver, a novel member of the major genomic component, as well as LTR retrotransposons and MITEs, which show drastically different copy number between bread wheat and rye, a useful genetic resource of wheat. Revolver consists of a single gene encoding a DNA-binding-like protein, which is transcriptionally active and does not suffer from epigenetic silencing. Revolver elements feature an autonomous transposon, which may complement in trans the propagation of related elements, including LARD, that might have contributed to plant genome expansion, rearrangement, and evolution.FundingThe authors acknowledge Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (MEXT) for the Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research Nos. 04760006 and 1360006 that supported this work."

High-density oligonucleotide array-based measurements have further established that many exons are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. The mechanisms underlying the tissue-dependent expression of most alternative exons remain, however, to be understood. In this study, we focus on one possible mechanism, namely the coupling of (tissue specific) transcription regulation with alternative splicing. We analyzed the FANTOM3 and H-Invitational datasets of full-length mouse and human cDNAs, respectively, and found that in transcription units with multiple start sites, the inclusion of at least 15% and possibly up to 30% of the ‘cassette’ exons correlates with the use of specific transcription start sites (TSS). The vast majority of TSS-associated exons are conserved between human and mouse, yet the conservation is weaker when compared with TSS-independent exons. Additionally, the currently available data only support a weak correlation between the probabilities of TSS association of orthologous exons.

High-density oligonucleotide array-based measurements have further established that many exons are expressed in a tissue-specific manner. The mechanisms underlying the tissue-dependent expression of most alternative exons remain, however, to be understood. In this study, we focus on one possible mechanism, namely the coupling of (tissue specific) transcription regulation with alternative splicing. We analyzed the FANTOM3 and H-Invitational datasets of full-length mouse and human cDNAs, respectively, and found that in transcription units with multiple start sites, the inclusion of at least 15% and possibly up to 30% of the ‘cassette’ exons correlates with the use of specific transcription start sites (TSS). The vast majority of TSS-associated exons are conserved between human and mouse, yet the conservation is weaker when compared with TSS-independent exons. Additionally, the currently available data only support a weak correlation between the probabilities of TSS association of orthologous exons. Our analysis thus suggests frequent coupling of transcriptional and splicing programs, and provides a large dataset of exons on which the molecular basis of this coupling can be further studied.1. IntroductionThe most common form of splice variation is the inclusion of an exon in some, but not all, of the transcripts of a gene.1,2 Numerous studies have been dedicated to specific instances of such exons, which are known by various names such as ‘cassette’, ‘alternative’, ‘skipped’, and ‘cryptic’ exons. The regulatory signals leading to the inclusion or exclusion of a cassette exon also form a vast topic of research. Computational studies are converging toward the view that cassette exons are generally less recognizable to the splicing machinery than constitutive exons due to their shorter length,3 lower strength of splice sites,4 and poor representation of general splice enhancers,1,5 The tissue-specific inclusion of these exons appears to be dependent upon specific regulatory elements, at least some of which are located in the strongly conserved intronic regions that flank the cassette exons.2,6–8One attractive hypothesis concerning the mechanism of tissue-specific inclusion of cassette exons involves the direct coupling between tissue-dependent transcription and splicing. It has been shown, for instance, that the promoter from which transcription is initiated can affect the inclusion of downstream exons through the recruitment of transcription factors and co-activators that modulate the elongation rate of RNA polymerase II9,10 (kinetic model). In turn, a low polymerase elongation rate can promote the inclusion of some exons that are skipped when the elongation rate is high, as has been shown for the fibronectin EDI exon.11 Alternatively, protein factors that are recruited at the stage of transcription initiation may interact with splicing factors (recruitment model). For instance, the inclusion of the fibronectin EDII exon, normally promoted by the SRp40 protein,12 is inhibited when transcription is initiated at a promoter containing a binding site for the PPARγ transcription factor. This is because the PPARγ transcription factor recruits an SRp40 inhibitor, the PGC-1 co-activator.13 The role of the promoter architecture on internal splicing has also been demonstrated for the cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator14 and for the steroid-sensitive genes.15 Such studies have been limited, however, to very few genes, prompting us to evaluate the extent to which transcriptional and splicing programs appear to be coordinated at the level of the whole transcriptome.2. Materials and methods2.1. Transcript mapping and splice analysisThe sequences used in the study consist of the 102 797 Fantom3 mouse cDNAs,16 52 070 mouse mRNAs from Genbank, and 167 992 human cDNAs from version 3.0 (http://www.h-invitational.jp/) of the H-Invitational project.17 We have mapped the mouse cDNAs to the mm7 assembly of the mouse genome and the human cDNAs to the hg18 assembly of the human genome, both available from the University of California at Santa Cruz.For the identification of splice variants, we used the automated splicing analysis pipeline that we have previously developed.1,18 Briefly, we first mapped all cDNAs to their respective genome using our spliced alignment algorithm (SPA).19 To avoid biases from transcripts that are badly mapped due to a high rate of sequencing errors or erroneous assembly, we select only those transcripts that have at least 75% of their nucleotides mapped to the genome, with at least 95% identity or less than ten mismatches in each exon. This procedure yielded 132 681 mouse and 110 978 human mapped transcripts, which we clustered such that the mapping of each transcript in a cluster shares at least one exonic nucleotide with at least one other transcript in the cluster.1,18,20 We obtained 42 407 mouse and 22 116 human clusters (transcription units) that we analyzed for splice variation. We were interested only in cassette exons with no other form of splice variation. We identified these as internal exons that were completely contained in an intron implied by the mapping of another transcript in the cluster, having the same splice boundaries in all transcripts in which they were included. Our final mouse dataset consisted of 29 416 transcripts and 4 964 internal cassette exons, and the human dataset of 79 030 transcripts and 11 664 internal cassette exons.2.2. Quantifying the evidence for coupling between the choice of transcription start sites and the inclusion/exclusion of internal exonsFor each transcription unit, we first identified (1) the set of internal cassette exons and (2) the set of transcription start sites (TSSs). The cassette exon annotation was determined as outlined above. To identify different TSSs used within a transcription unit, we had to define precisely what we mean by a unique TSS. The analysis of mammalian TSSs by Carninci et al.21 has shown that most TSSs show some amount of variability. Especially at TSSs located in CpG islands, one finds transcripts starting from many different nearby sites covering tens and sometimes hundreds of nucleotides. We, therefore, needed to group transcripts whose apparent start sites were ‘near’ each other and then identify different TSSs with the different clusters of apparent start sites. We decided to take a conservative approach to this clustering of apparent start sites in a transcription unit by considering all transcripts that started within the same exon to derive from the same TSS. That is, in our analysis different TSSs correspond to different initial exons in the transcripts.In addition, we tested the validity of our results, on a separate dataset in which we use only transcripts whose initial exons were confirmed by CAGE tag data.22 In the latter case, the initial exon was considered confirmed as a TSS if one or more CAGE tags were found within 100 bp of the start of the exon in the genome. Since the results did not change, and the requirement of CAGE validation of TSSs reduced the size of our data-set significantly, we did not use the CAGE validated TSSs further.For each internal cassette exon, we collected all transcripts that could have included the exon as an internal exon, i.e. those transcripts that contained exons both upstream and downstream of the genomic location of the exon in question, and determined the TSS that was used for each of these transcripts. We thus obtained a list of TSSs that were used in the set of transcripts in which the cassette exon could have been included. For further analyses, we kept only cassette exons for which multiple TSSs were identified. We then counted, for each TSS in the list, how many transcripts starting from this TSS included the exon, and how many transcripts excluded the exon. For each internal exon, we thus obtained counts of the number of times each TSS was used in a transcript whose locus covered the exon, and the number of times the exon was included and excluded with each of the TSSs.This distribution is shown as the solid line in Fig. 2. We calculated the expectation value 〈f〉 = ∫ fP(f | D) df and using 〈f〉 as a prior probability of the independent model we computed, for each individual exon, the posterior probability that the inclusion of the exon is TSS associated.We also generated a randomized dataset Drand by, for each exon, randomly distributing the n inclusions of the exon among the different TSSs, in such a way that the total number of transcripts ti for each TSS i stays the same. That is, the data Drand were generated in accordance with the independent model, keeping the total inclusion counts n, and total TSS counts {ti} of the real data. The distribution P(f|Drand) is shown as the dotted line in Fig. 2.2.3. Extraction of constitutive exonsWe used our database to identify internal exons that were included in more than ten transcripts and did not have any splice variation. We obtained 5136 and 6377 such exons for mouse and human, respectively, and we used these as internal constitutive exons.2.4. Computation of the exon conservation statisticsWe used the whole-genome alignments provided by the University of California, at Santa Cruz (http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/mm7/vsHg18/axtNet/ and http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg18/vsmm7/axtNet/) to extract alignments of mouse exons in our dataset with the corresponding orthologous regions from the human genome, and of human exons with the corresponding orthologous regions from the mouse genome. We found orthologous human regions for 438 of the 496 TSS-associated, 469 of the 496 TSS-independent, and 5122 of the 5136 constitutive internal mouse exons. Similarly, we found orthologous mouse regions for 1003 of the 1166 TSS-associated, 1078 of the 1166 TSS-independent, and 6344 of the 6377 constitutive internal human exons. On the basis of the extracted alignments, we determined the fraction of all mouse exon nucleotides that are perfectly conserved in human, and the fraction of human exon nucleotides that are conserved in mouse.To compute the correlation between posterior probabilities of TSS association in human and mouse, we used the following procedure. We started with cassette exons from transcription units with multiple TSSs from human. On the basis of the whole-enome alignments, we found the orthologous mouse exons as described above, and then we intersected the coordinates of these orthologs with the coordinates of mouse cassette exons that were part of transcription units with multiple TSSs. This procedure gave us the list of orthologous cassette exons that were part of transcription units with multiple TSSs in both human and mouse. We checked that we obtain the same list of exons if we start from the mouse cassette exons and compute their human orthologs. We did not set a threshold of minimal conservation between orthologous exons, as the dataset is already relatively small, and our previous results were not sensitive to the precise threshold of conservation that we used.2.5. Computation of the average distance to an inclusion-promoting TSS and to a skipping-promoting TSSWe identified all transcripts in which a particular cassette exon was included, and for each of them, we determined the distance in the genome between the TSS and the start of the cassette exon. We then averaged these distances to obtain the average distance of the exon to an inclusion-promoting TSS. Similarly, we identified all transcripts in which a particular cassette exon was skipped, and we computed the average distance of the exon to a skipping-promoting TSS.2.6. Analysis of 5′ EST dataTo address the issue of biases in the coverage of gene structures that may have been introduced by the selection of clones for full-length cDNA sequencing, we have performed the same analysis using only 5′ EST sequences. On the basis of the October 2007 UniGene database, we extracted 3 738 929 human 5′ EST sequences. We removed from this set those ESTs with low sequence quality (over 3% ambiguous nucleotides), we then trimmed the polyA tails and discarded those ESTs whose length was <95 after polyA tail removal (using the trimpoly program of the SeqClean package from http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/software/). We thus obtained 3 700 028 ESTs, which we mapped to the hg18 assembly of the human genome using our SPA program.19 After mapping, we retained for further analysis only ESTs, which contained at least two exons, were mapped with overall 95% identity, and whose every exon was mapped with at least 98% identity to the human genome. This selection left 1 276 669 good quality ESTs, which we clustered based on exon overlap and annotated for splice variation as described in Section 2.1.3. Results and discussion3.1.

Exons are indicated by (green) boxes and introns by red lines. Cassette exons are shown with a black frame.

Table 1 summarizes the data in the figure, indicating how many times the exon was included and how many times skipped when a particular TSS was used.As described in Section 2.2, we can use Equation (7) and Bayes' theorem to calculate the posterior probability P(f|D) that a fraction f of all cassette exons is dependent on the TSS. The distributions P(f|D) obtained for both the human and mouse data are shown as solid lines in Fig. 2. They suggest that the inclusion of about 24% (99% posterior probability interval 17.4–30.6%) of all cassette exons in our mouse dataset and 30% (99% posterior probability interval 26.2–34.9%) of all cassette exons in our human dataset is dependent on the TSSs of the corresponding transcripts. To additionally test the statistical significance of this result, we created randomized datasets Drand by permuting, for each cassette exon, the inclusions and exclusions among the TSSs in such a way that the total number of times each TSS was used, and the total number of times the exon was included remained unchanged. The posterior distributions P(f|Drand) obtained by applying the Bayesian procedure to the randomized data are shown as dashed lines in Fig. 2. These distributions show that the Bayesian procedure correctly infers that the inclusion of <5% (and likely none) of the cassette exons in Drand depends on TSS. Moreover, Fig. 2 shows the striking difference between the real and randomized data, which is due to the enrichment of cassette exons with high posterior probability of TSS dependency in the real data.The posterior probability P(f|D) that the inclusion of cassette exons is dependent on the TSS in a fraction f of all cassette exons (solid line).

The upper panel shows the human data, and the lower panel the mouse data.Using the estimated fraction 〈f〉 (the mean of the posterior distribution P(f|D)) as a prior that the inclusion of a cassette exon depends on TSS, we computed the posterior probability that the inclusion of each exon in our dataset is TSS dependent (see Section 2.2). These data are given in the Supplementary table, and can also be further explored using the server that we established at http://www.spaed.unibas.ch/Promoter_data/TSS_cassette_exons_spaed_human.html and http://www.spaed.unibas.ch/Promoter_data/TSS_cassette_exons_spaed_mouse.html.Fig. 1 shows the cassette exon with the highest posterior probability of TSS dependence in our mouse data. The exon belongs to the gene aspartate beta hydrolase has a posterior probability of TSS dependency of 0.89, and is indicated in the figure by the thin black rectangle. For clarity, we showed only the transcripts whose genomic loci contain the cassette exon, and we also truncated some of the transcripts after the exon in question. There are three different TSSs upstream of the exon, and a total of 23 transcripts that could have included this exon. Of the 11 transcripts originating in the two upstream TSSs, only one includes the cassette exon. In contrast, nine of the 12 transcripts originating from the third TSS include the cassette exon.One may wonder to what extent our results are affected by imperfect efficiency of full length cDNA capture. That is, if a significant fraction of the cDNAs is not full length, the apparent TSSs for these transcripts would be incorrect, and one may wonder how they would influence our results. We have addressed this question by performing the same analysis using only transcripts whose start site was confirmed by CAGE tag data,22 and obtained essentially the same results. However, since requiring additional confirmation of TSSs substantially reduces the sizes of our datasets, we did not use this dataset further.It is important to note that we do not need to find the precise locations of the TSSs which may in fact be much less precise than initially thought,21 but we only need to separate our transcripts into sets that arose from the same transcription initiation regions, controlled by specific sets of regulatory signals. We decided to simply assume that transcripts with the same initial exon arose from the same TSS and that transcripts with different initial exons arose from different TSSs. Two types of errors may occur in this classification. First, transcripts that arose from two different, but nearby TSSs may be assigned to a single common TSS. Second, if a transcript is severely truncated due to cloning or sequencing errors, it may appear to start in an exon which is downstream from its real initial exon. Since the first type of error reduces our ability to distinguish different TSSs, and the second error per definition must be uncorrelated with splicing, the effect of both types of errors will be to reduce the correlations between TSS usage and splicing. Therefore, the clear correlations that we observe in spite of these potential errors should be considered to provide a lower bound on the correlations that do exist.Another concern may be that the gene structures inferred from full-length cDNA are not representative, because the full-length cDNA sequencing projects generally included a prioritization step, that may have caused an apparent enrichment in rare splice variants. To address this issue, we have constructed a database of splice variants using solely human 5′-end ESTs, which we obtained based on the UniGene annotation. We analyzed these data using the same model as we used for full-length cDNAs. The 99% probability interval computed using this dataset was 0.74–0.78, compared with 0–0.009 obtained using the corresponding randomized dataset. This indicates that TSS-associated splice events are in fact even more frequent than initially estimated from full-length cDNA data. The likely reason why the estimate of the fraction of TSS-associated exons is larger when using 5′ EST data compared with full-length cDNA data is illustrated in Fig. 3. The exon indicated by the box belongs to the cAMP-dependent protein kinase catalytic beta subunit (PRKACB), is always skipped when the two upstream promoters are used (136 ESTs), and is generally included with the most downstream promoter (46 of 56 ESTs). These counts are very unlikely under a model in which the promoter usage and exon inclusion are uncoupled. Generally, many exons that in the cDNA data did not have sufficient coverage to allow us to detect their TSS association do have sufficient coverage in the 5′ EST data to allow this inference to be made, and consequently, the fraction of exons inferred to be TSS associated is larger.Example of an internal cassette exon whose inclusion is strongly correlated with specific TSSs as inferred from 5′ EST data. The conventions used in this representation are the same as for Fig. 1. Exons shown in green have invariant splice boundaries, those in yellow have variable splice donor sites, and those in cyan intron inclusion. The inclusion of the exon indicated by the black box occurs only when the most downstream TSSs are used.Example of an internal cassette exon whose inclusion is strongly correlated with specific TSSs as inferred from 5′ EST data.

The inclusion of the exon indicated by the black box occurs only when the most downstream TSSs are used.3.2. Evolutionary conservation of TSS associationIf the correlation that we inferred between transcriptional and splicing events is functionally relevant, one would expect that the TSS dependence tends to be conserved between orthologous cassette exons. This could, for instance, manifest itself in a correlation of the posterior probabilities of TSS dependence of orthologous cassette exons. To check this, we started with the human and mouse cassette exons that are part of transcription units with multiple start sites, and we used the UCSC human-to-mouse and mouse-to-human whole-genome alignments to identify orthologous exons (see Section 2.4). This procedure yielded 668 pairs of orthologs. We then computed the correlation coefficient between the posterior probabilities of orthologous exons. As shown in Fig. 4 we obtained a weak, but significant (P = 0.002) correlation between the probabilities of TSS association of orthologous exons, providing some evidence that TSS dependence of exon inclusion is evolutionarily conserved.Correlation between the posterior probabilities of TSS association for orthologous human–mouse cassette exons. Each dot represents one exon, with the x-coordinate being the posterior probability of TSS association of the human exon and the y-coordinate being the the posterior probability of TSS association of the orthologous mouse exon. The correlation coefficient is r = 0.12, P-value = 0.002.Correlation between the posterior probabilities of TSS association for orthologous human–mouse cassette exons.

The correlation coefficient is r = 0.12, P-value = 0.002.One of the best examples of an evolutionarily conserved relationship is shown in Fig. 5. The exon with a high probability of TSS association (P = 1 in human and P = 0.73 in mouse) is indicated by an arrow. It is included in the skeletal form of tropomyosin, which uses the most upstream TSS, and is excluded in other forms of tropomyosin, which also tend to use downstream TSSs.Conserved TSS association for a tropomyosin exon. The intron/exon structure of tropomyosin transcripts initiated from various TSSs is shown, with exons represented as black boxes and introns as red lines connecting the exons. The number of times each transcript form was observed in our dataset is indicated by the ‘multiplicity’ column on the right-hand side of the transcripts. The orthologous cassette exons are indicated by arrows, and their posterior probabilities of TSS association are indicated.Conserved TSS association for a tropomyosin exon.

The number of times each transcript form was observed in our dataset is indicated by the ‘multiplicity’ column on the right-hand side of the transcripts. The orthologous cassette exons are indicated by arrows, and their posterior probabilities of TSS association are indicated.The level of evolutionary conservation of cassette exons has previously been related to the rate of inclusion of the exons in mature mRNAs: the so-called ‘major form’ exons, which are predominantly included, are as conserved as constitutive exons, whereas ‘minor form’ exons, which are predominantly skipped, appear to be of a more recent evolutionary origin,23 rarely having orthologs between human and rodents. To understand where TSS-associated exons fit in this evolutionary scenario, we analyzed the degree of human–mouse conservation of the following categories of exons: (1) TSS-associated exons—those with the top 10% values of posterior probability of TSS association, (2) TSS-independent exons—those with the bottom 10% values of posterior probability of TSS association, and (3) constitutive exons—exons included with no variation in more than ten transcripts. For each of these exons, we extracted the mouse—human and human–mouse alignments from the whole genome alignments provided by the UCSC (see Section 2.4). We then computed the fraction of exons that have orthologs in the other species and the fraction of nucleotides in each exon that are conserved. As shown in Table 1, we found that the large majority of TSS-associated exons are conserved between mouse and human (438/496 = 88.3% of mouse and 1003/1166 = 86.02% of human TSS-associated exons). Particularly, TSS-associated exons are much more strongly conserved than ‘minor form’ exons, only 27–31% of which having been reported to be conserved between human and rodents,23 However, TSS-associated exons are significantly less conserved than TSS-independent exons (469/496 = 94.6% in mouse and 1077/1166 = 92.4% in human, P-value of the χ2 test = 6.7 × 10−4 for mouse and 1.12 × 10−6 for human). These results are not sensitive to the precise threshold beyond which we consider an exon ‘conserved’. Among those TSS-associated exons that do have orthologs, the proportion of conserved nucleotides is lower compared with TSS-independent exons (P-value: 2.9 × 10−12 for human and 2.2 × 10−3 for mouse), as well as compared with constitutive exons (P-value of the Wilcoxon test <2.2 × 10−16 for human and 4.7 × 10−2 for mouse). Consistent with previous results relating the degree of evolutionary conservation to the inclusion rate of the exons,23 we found that the overall inclusion rate of TSS-associated exons is lower than the inclusion rate of TSS-independent exons (Table 1). Thus, the results suggest that some of the TSS-associated exons are of relatively recent evolutionary origin, and it will be interesting to establish whether the TSSs that promote their inclusion have also undergone recent evolutionary changes. On the other hand, the relatively weak correlation between the probabilities of TSS association of orthologous exons is likely to be in part due to the fact that the human and mouse sequencing projects did not cover sufficiently similar sets of tissues. This would be reflected in different relative usage of the alternative TSSs and exons between human and mouse and these, in turn, would be reflected in disparate probabilities of TSS association of orthologous exons in the two species.Comparison of TSS associated, TSS independent, and constitutive exonsComparison of TSS associated, TSS independent, and constitutive exonsFinally, we did not find a consistent trend in the proportion of ‘symmetrical’ exons, i.e. the proportion of exons whose length is a multiple of three, among our different categories of exons. We did not specifically select the exons for being part of coding regions, but rather we only considered internal exons in our analysis. As shown in Table 1, the proportion of symmetrical exons is significantly higher than expected by chance, i.e. 1/3, for all exon types (TSS-associated, TSS-independent, constitutive). In human, TSS-associated exons have a significantly higher tendency for symmetry compared with constitutive internal exons (P-value of the χ2 test = 0.02), and lower, but not significantly, compared with TSS-independent exons (P-value of the χ2 test = 0.07). The tendencies are similar in mouse, but the differences are not statistically significant (P-value of the χ2 test = 0.36 in the comparison with constitutive exons and 0.097 in the comparison with TSS-independent exons).3.3 Insights into the mechanism of coupling between transcriptional and splicing eventsWe can envision two mechanisms that could give rise to the correlation that we observe between transcriptional and splicing events. One is that tissue-specific transcriptional and splicing events are induced by independent, but tissue-specific transcription and splicing factors. The second mechanism involves a direct influence of tissue-specific transcription factors on internal splicing. We reasoned that if an exon is always included when one TSS is used and always skipped when another TSS is used, yet the two TSSs are both used in the same tissue, then the TSS association may be due to direct coupling of transcription with exon selection. To identify such cases, we used the library annotation of the transcripts in our datasets. We found that for 21% of the human and 14% of the mouse TSS-associated exons the inclusion- and skipping-promoting TSS have been both used in the same tissue.One model that has been proposed for the coupling between transcriptional and splicing events is known as the ‘kinetic model’,10 which postulates that cassette exons with weaker splice signals compared with constitutive exons tend to be skipped when the transcript is produced by a fast-elongating polymerase. In contrast, when the polymerase elongation rate is low, the spliceosome has sufficient time to assemble on these cassette exons, which are then spliced into the mature mRNA. We used a web server implementing the Shapiro and Senapathy model24 (http://ast.bioinfo.tau.ac.il/SpliceSiteFrame.htm) to evaluate the strength of the splice sites of the cassette exons as well as of the exons flanking them. We found that the strength of the splice sites is comparable between the cassette exons and the exons flanking them (data not shown), suggesting that one of the pre-requisites of the kinetic model (weaker splice sites) is not met by our sets of TSS-associated exons.Given that the elongation rate is not homogeneous along a gene, and that promoter-proximal pausing of RNA polymerase II is common,25 we reasoned that the elongation rate of the polymerase may be generally lower at the start of the transcripts, allowing better recognition of cassette exons that are close to the TSS. Therefore, we asked whether the TSS-associated exons tend to be included when the TSS closest to them is used, as this may allow sufficient time for spliceosome assembly. We found this not to be the case: for all TSS-associated exons, we computed the average distance Di between the exon and the TSSs of transcripts that included the exon, and the average distance Ds between the exon and the TSSs of transcripts that excluded the exon. We then constructed a histogram of the difference Di − Ds across cassette exons (Fig. 6). To improve visibility of the histogram, we split it into a part where Di − Ds > 0 and a part where Di − Ds < 0, and plotted the absolute distance |Di − Ds| on a logarithmic scale. We found that approximately the same proportion of TSS-associated exons are preferentially included with the most upstream TSSs as are included with the most downstream TSSs (Fig. 6). This suggests that proximity to the TSS, which may be indicative of lower polymerase elongation rate, cannot explain the inclusion pattern of TSS-associated cassette exons.Histogram of the signed difference between the logarithm (base 10) of the average distance to TSS when the exon is included and the average distance to TSS when the exon is skipped.

Human data are shown in black and mouse data are shown in red.To conclude, we estimated that exons whose inclusion in the mature mRNA is correlated with specific TSSs are rather common, i.e. they represent at least 15% of all internal cassette exons. The correlation may be due to direct coupling between transcription and splicing or indirect coupling, due, for instance, to a tissue-specific signaling pathway that activates both the transcription factors responsible for determining the TSS as well as the splicing factors responsible for the inclusion or exclusion of the cassette exon. Nonetheless, for at least 14–21% of the TSS-associated exons, TSSs that are associated with exclusion and TSSs that are associated with inclusion occur both in the same tissue, suggesting a more direct connection between the TSS and exon inclusion for at least these exons. The details of the molecular mechanism underlying this dependency remain to be uncovered, and may involve a gene-specific component, as suggested by our observation that some exons are predominantly included when the proximal TSSs are used, while other exons are predominantly skipped. One way of implementing a gene-(and tissue-) specific component could be through dynamic changes in the local chromatin structure that induce in turn local variations in the polymerase elongation rate.26 This is a topic for future study and the cassette exons for which we estimated a high probability of TSS association provide good starting points for experimental investigations.

IntroductionThe emerging field of synthetic genomics is expected to facilitate the generation of microorganisms with the potential to achieve a sustainable society.1–3 One approach towards this goal is the reduction of microbial genomes by rationally designed deletions to create simplified cells with predictable behavior that act as a platform to build in various genetic systems for specific purposes. It is expected that metabolic waste in these cells will be decreased, as fewer dispensable proteins are synthesized. Challenges to reduce the genome size by the stepwise introduction of large-scale deletions have been undertaken for Escherichia coli4,5 and Bacillus subtilis.6,7In a previous study, Posfai et al.4 reported an E. coli strain, MDS42, in which ∼15% of the genome sequence (0.71 Mb) was removed by planned and sequential deletions to eliminate all mobile DNA and cryptic virulence genes. The resultant strain displayed normal cell growth and protein expression comparable with that of the parental strain, MG1655. Interestingly, genome reduction gave rise to unexpected beneficial properties. MDS42 cells exhibit high electroporation efficiency and allow the accurate propagation of plasmids that are unstable in other strains. Another E. coli strain, MGF-01, with a 22% genome size reduction (1.03 Mb) was created in Japan using a similar strategy.5 MGF-01 cells also displayed an unexpected phenotype in that growth was as rapid as the parental W3110 strain in M9 minimal medium during the exponential phase, but continued after the wild-type strain had progressed to the stationary phase. In addition, MGF-01 secreted twice the amount of threonine as the wild-type strain.B. subtilis, one of the most extensively studied model microorganisms, displays superior ability to produce various secretary enzymes. This ability has been widely applied to produce various useful enzymes in the industrial field.8 The 4.2 Mb B. subtilis genome contains 10 horizontally acquired prophage (SPβ and PBSX) and prophage-like (pro1-7 and skin) sequences.9 In addition, 2.8% of the genome encompasses two large operons that produce secondary metabolites (pks and pps). Systematic inactivation of the protein-coding regions revealed that only 271 genes are indispensable for growth in rich medium (LB) at 37°C, as growth is impossible in the absence of these genes.10 Westers et al.7 reported a B. subtilis Δ6 mutant strain with a 7.7% reduction of the genome (0.53 Mb) produced by deleting two prophage (SPβ, PBSX), three prophage-like sequences (pro1, pro6, skin), and the pks operon. However, phenotypic characterization of the Δ6 cells disclosed no unique properties, including secretion of AmyQ protein, relative to wild-type 168 cells.7 Our group generated a strain, MGB469, in which all prophage and prophage-like sequences, except pro7, as well as pks and pps operons, were deleted.6 In this case, cell growth was normal, but no beneficial properties were apparent, including exogenous protein production from the plasmid harboring the corresponding genes. Moreover, we constructed the MG1M strain containing an additional six deletions in the MGB469 genome, resulting in a 0.99 Mb reduction in genome size.6 However, the MG1M strain displayed unstable phenotypes with regard to growth rate, cell morphology, and recombinant protein productivity after successive culture, making it inappropriate for further studies.Here, we report the generation of another multiple-deletion series of mutants, from MGB469 as the starting strain through to MGB874 with a total 0.87 Mb genome deletion. When compared with wild-type cells, the regulatory network of gene expression of the mutant strain is reorganized after entry into the transition state due to the synergistic effect of multiple deletions, and productivity of extracellular cellulase and protease from transformed plasmids harboring the corresponding genes is remarkably enhanced. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of synthetic genomics in creating novel and useful bacteria for industrial use.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Culture media and measurement of enzyme activitySpizizen's minimal medium (SMM)11 comprising 0.2% (NH4)2SO4, 1.4% K2HPO4, 0.6% KH2PO4, 0.1% Na3C6H5O7·2H2O, and 0.02% MgSO4·7H2O was supplemented with 0.5% glucose and trace elements.12 LB contained 1% tryptone peptone (Difco), 0.5% yeast extract (Difco), and 0.5% NaCl. The 2xL-Mal medium contained 2% tryptone peptone (Difco), 1% yeast extract (Difco), 1% NaCl, 7.5% maltose hydrate, and 7.5 μg/mL MnSO4. Protease and cellulase activities in culture medium were determined as described previously.13,142.2 High-resolution transcriptome analysisThe custom Affymetrix tiling chip used contains 55 430 25-mer probes for the coding strand of protein coding regions at 25–30 bp intervals and 72 218 probes for both strands of intergenic regions at 2–3 bp intervals.15 Cultures (200 mL) of wild-type 168 and MGB874 cells (OD600 = 0.6) in 2xL-Mal at 30°C were inoculated into 15 L of 2xL-Mal medium within a 30 L jar fermenter. Total RNA was extracted from B. subtilis cells (10 OD600), as described previously.16 Synthesis of cDNA, terminal labeling, and oligonucleotide chip hybridization were performed following the Affymetrix instruction manual. Briefly, cDNA was synthesized from 10 μg total RNA using random primers and reverse transcriptase (Superscript III, Invitrogen), followed by purification using QiaQuick columns (Qiagen) and digestion with DNase I (GE Healthcare Bioscience). Next, cDNA fragments were terminally labeled with biotin-ddUTP using a ENZO BioArray Terminal Labeling Kit (Enzo Life Sciences). Hybridization with the oligonucleotide chip was performed for 16 h at 42°C, followed by washing, staining, and scanning using the GeneChip Instrument System, according to the manufacturer's instructions (Affymetrix). Transcriptional signals were analyzed and visualized along the genome coordinate with the In Silico Molecular Cloning program, Array Edition (In Silico Biology). To compensate for the differences in hybridization efficiency of each 25-mer probe on the chip, we divided the hybridization intensities of cDNA synthesized from total RNA by those of total genome DNA. The signal intensities of each experiment were adjusted to confer a signal average of 500 and normalized by MA plot analysis for comparison of MGB874 and wild-type 168 data.17,18 The average signal intensities of probes in each coding sequence were calculated after removal of the lowest and highest intensities.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Multiple-deletion series mutants designTo construct the multiple-deletion series mutants, we initially identified contiguous genome sequences >10 kb that did not code for RNA or essential proteins. In addition, we excluded all known and possible genes involved in primary metabolism to maintain growth in minimum medium, as well as those related to DNA metabolism to avoid genome instability. In total, 74 regions, including prophage, prophage-like, and secondary metabolite-producing sequences, were selected and individually replaced with the tetracycline-resistant gene (tet) by selection on LB plates. As a result, we obtained deletion mutants for 63 regions, totaling up to ∼2 Mb (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S1). However, a number of the deletion mutants did not grow in SMM, and others showed impaired growth, even in liquid LB medium (Supplementary Table S1).Design and basal phenotypic analysis of MGB874.

The average cell length is indicated (∼200 cells analyzed).3.2. Step-by-step B. subtilis genome reductionNext, we attempted to construct a reduced genome B. subtilis strain by step-by-step deletions in regions where single deletions did not affect cell growth, applying the upp (encoding uracil-phosphoribosyl-transferase) cassette and 5-fluorouracil (5-FU ) selection20 to remove the drug-resistant markers used to introduce primary deletions (Fig. 2). Accordingly, sequential deletions in 11 non-essential gene clusters were introduced in the MGB469 strain to generate MGB874 depleted of 874 kb (20.7%) of the sequence spanning 865 genes from the original B. subtilis 168 genome (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S2). Although the growth rate of MGB874 cells was reduced (30% in LB and 50% in SMM) compared with the wild-type 168 strain (Fig. 1B), cell morphology and chromosome distribution were normal (Fig. 1C). The reduced growth rate indicates that certain non-annotated and deleted genes contribute to the metabolic capacity of B. subtilis cells under normal growth conditions. It is also possible that this phenotype is caused by unexpected synergetic effects of the deletions of annotated genes. Moreover, MGB874 cells did not form spores (data not shown), owing to the deletion of genes essential for spore formation, including spoIVCB and spoIIIC that encode the N- and C- terminal regions of sporulation-specific sigma factor-K, respectively.Sequential introduction of large-scale deletions into the B. subtilis genome. A derivative of B. subtilis 168, 168 Δupp, in which the upp gene encoding uracil-phosphoribosyl-transferase is inactivated by replacement with the erythromycin-resistance gene (erm), was used as the starting strain for generation of the deletion mutant series. The entire length of the tetracycline-resistant gene (tet) cassette with its 5′-regulatory region was amplified from the pBEST307 plasmid.19 At least 500 bp of sequences flanking both sides of the region to be deleted were amplified by PCR and joined upstream and downstream of the tet cassette by ligation using overlapping sequences in primers. The B. subtilis 168 Δupp strain and its derivatives were transformed with the resultant fragment to obtain a strain in which the target sequence was replaced with the tet gene (Step 1). Next, to obtain markerless mutants, fragments upstream and downstream of the target sequence were amplified, ligated, and cloned into the pBRcat/upp plasmid harboring the upp and chloramphenicol resistance (cat) gene. The resultant plasmid was integrated into the genome of the primary transformant with selection for tetracycline and chloramphenicol resistance (Step 2). The resultant strain became 5-FU sensitive as a result of introduction of the functional upp gene, and mutants without the plasmid sequence were selected on LB plates containing 10 μM 5FU (Step 3). The crosses indicate the recombination site.Sequential introduction of large-scale deletions into the B. subtilis genome.

Exogenous protein productivity in the B. subtilis genome reduction mutantsTo assess the productivity of MGB874 cells in terms of exogenous protein secretion, we examined the production of thermostable alkaline cellulase, Egl237,13 and alkaline protease (M-protease)14 from a multicopy plasmid, pHY300PLK (∼50 copies per cell) harboring the respective genes under the control of a constitutive SigA-dependent promoter of Egl237.13 We introduced the pHYS2376 (for cellulase production) or pHP237-K166 (for protease production) plasmids into the multiple-deletion series strains generated (MGB469 to MGB874) and measured the protease and cellulase activities after 75 h culture in 2xL-Mal, a model medium for industrial protein production (Fig. 3A). Unexpectedly, the production of both enzymes increased in proportion to genome deletion lengths, with maximum levels estimated in the MGB874 strain. The activities of cellulase and protease in the culture medium of MGB874 cells were about 1.7- and 2.5-fold higher than those from wild-type cells, respectively. Increase in cell mass was similar for MGB874 and wild-type cells (Fig. 3B), and cellulase production was arrested in wild-type 168 cells from 28 h upwards (Fig. 3C). In contrast, the cellulase level in MGB874 cells continued to increase throughout the culture period to about twice that obtained from wild-type 168. The production period for protease was similarly elongated in the mutant strain (data not shown). Furthermore, maltose consumption in the culture medium was enhanced in MGB874 cells (Fig. 3D), indicating that the efficiency of carbon source utilization also is improved as a result of genome reduction.Productivity of extracellular enzymes by the multiple-deletion series strains.

Reprogramming of the transcriptional regulatory network in MGB874 cellsTo assess the molecular events underlying these unexpected phenomena, we compared the transcriptome profiles of MGB874 and wild-type 168 cells during growth in 2xL-Mal medium using a custom Affymetrix tiling chip, as described previously,15 and expression levels of each genes in MGB874 and 168 cells were determined as described in Materials and Methods (Supplementary Table S3). Transcriptome analysis revealed that the expression of a limited number of genes was disrupted in MGB874 cells at the early exponential growth phase. The correlation coefficient of the expression levels of each gene between the two strains was 0.94 (Fig. 4A), but decreased as a function of culture time to 0.71 after 60 h (Fig. 4B–F).Comparison of gene expression in wild-type 168 and MGB874 cells. Total RNA was extracted from both strains grown in 2xL-Mal medium for 1 (A), 7.5 (B), 13 (C), 26 (D), 40 (E), and 60 (F) hours (Fig. 3B) and used for tiling chip analysis. The average signal intensities of probes in each coding sequence were calculated after removal of the lowest and highest intensities. Scatter plots of expression in wild-type 168 and MGB874 cells are presented. Genes deleted in MGB874 were excluded from the analysis. The correlation coefficient is indicated.Comparison of gene expression in wild-type 168 and MGB874 cells.

Scatter plots of expression in wild-type 168 and MGB874 cells are presented. Genes deleted in MGB874 were excluded from the analysis. The correlation coefficient is indicated.When nutrients in the culture medium were exhausted, B. subtilis cells entered the transition state, accompanied by various phenomena, such as competence for transformation, secretion of degradative enzymes, and induction of motility through a complex network of global regulators, including ComPA and DegSU two-component systems, the AbrB transition state regulator, and the alternative sigma factor, SigD. Finally, phosphorylation of a two-component regulator, Spo0A, triggers a regulatory program for spore formation involving the activation of an alternative sigma factor, Spo0H, and sporulation-specific sigma factors, SigF and SigG, in prespores and SigE and SigK in mother cells.22 A closer examination of the changes in transcriptome profiles associated with entry into the stationary phase, and activation of the sporulation program in MGB874 and wild-type cells disclosed remarkable differences in these processes between the two strains. The ComA regulator that induces competence was activated earlier in MGB874 cells, observed as the expression of the srf operon and pel gene that are directly stimulated by ComA.23 Moreover, competence genes that are indirectly activated by ComA via the master regulator, ComK, were induced earlier in MGB874 cells, compared with the wild-type strain (Fig. 5A). The degU regulator participating in competence activation in the non-phosphorylated form24 and protein production in the highly phosphorylated form25 was induced earlier and maintained at high levels throughout the culture period in MGB874 cells (Fig. 5B). This altered feature may also contribute to the earlier competence development in MGB874 cells. However, degradative protein production, possibly dependent on DegU, was similar in both MGB874 and wild-type cells, except for major intracellular serine protease (IspA) and bacillopeptidase F (Bpr), which were strongly induced in MGB874 cells at the late growth phase (Fig. 5B). In contrast, inhibition of the expression of the transition state regulator, AbrB, which represses transition-state genes in the exponential growth phase and is suppressed by phospho-Spo0A,22 was delayed in MGB874 cells (Fig. 5C). Consistent with this observation, MGB874 cells displayed disrupted expression of SigH, which is repressed by AbrB and activated by phospho-Spo0A. In addition, activation of sporulation-specific sigma factors was delayed in MGB874 cells, as evident from the delay in the expression patterns of genes under their control (except those directed by SigK, which is deleted in MGB874) (Fig. 5D). These findings suggest that the transition state is extended in MGB874 cells, compared with the wild-type strain. Furthermore, expression levels of the ctaABCDEFG operon encoding cytochrome c oxidase and the atpIBEFHAGDC operon encoding F0F1ATP synthase in MGB874 cells were maintained throughout the culture period (Fig. 5E). Interestingly, appDFABC and dppBCDE encoding ABC transporters for oligopeptide and dipeptide, respectively, malP representing maltose-specific PTS enzyme, and bioWFADB coding for biotin biosynthesis enzymes were active throughout the culture period (Fig. 5E). Thus, it appears that metabolic activities are maintained in the extended transition state of MGB874 cells. Global regulators for the transition state influence each other in terms of expression, forming a complex regulatory network. Moreover, activities of ComA, DegU, and Spo0F (phosphorylates Spo0A) are regulated by Rap family proteins to control the precise activation timing.22 Six rap genes among the 11 encoded in the B. subtilis genome were deleted in the MGB874 strain, which may attribute to the disruption of transition state timing and gene expression during sporulation. A significant increase of protein productivity occurred in the deletion process from MGB625 to MGB723 (Fig. 3A). The rapG gene and its regulator phrG were deleted in this process, suggesting that the deletion of RapG had a major impact on protein productivity among deletions of six rap genes.Identification of genes with significantly disrupted expression in MGB874 cells, compared with wild-type cells. The average signal intensities of probes in each coding sequence in wild-type 168 (open diamonds) and MGB874 (closed squares) cells grown in 2xL-Mal medium for 1 (A), 7.5 (B), 13 (C), 26 (D), 40 (E), and 60 (F) h (Fig. 3B) are indicated.

(H) Phosphate metabolism-related genes.Maintenance of metabolic activities in the extended transition state of MGB874 cells would be a basis for increased enzyme productivity. In addition, the remarkable changes in gene expression observed might be related to higher protein productivity of MGB874 cells (Fig. 5F). B. subtilis SigD, activated in the transition state, is responsible for the transcription of genes for flagellar assembly, motility, chemotaxis, and autolysis.26,27 However, significantly low transcription of SigD and genes under its control was observed in MGB874 cells. The argGH and argCJBD operons for arginine biosynthesis were induced during the transition state in wild-type cells, but not in the mutant MGB874 cells. In contrast, a number of genes were strongly induced in MGB874 cells, including yxkJ encoding L-malate and citrate transporter, levDEFG encoding fructose-specific PTS enzyme, and oxdC encoding cytosolic oxalate decarboxylase (Fig. 5G). We additionally observed the earlier and stronger induction of genes related to phosphate metabolism under the control of the PhoPR two-component system28 in MGB874 cells, including glpQ encoding glycerophosphoryl diester phosphodiesterase, phoD (phosphodiesterase), phoA (alkaline phosphatase A), pstSCAB (phosphate transporter), and tuaABCDEFG (teichuronic acid biosynthesis) (Fig. 5H).These results indicate that considerable reprogramming of the transcriptional regulatory network occurs in MGB874 cells, probably due to the synergistic effect of multiple deletions, although the molecular basis for these changes and their relationship to increased protein productivity await further investigation.4. ConclusionTo our knowledge, this is the first report demonstrating that genome reduction actually contributes to the creation of bacterial cells with a practical application in industry. It is not clear at the moment that phenomena we observed are due to a global synergistic effect of large-scale genome reduction or mainly due to the deletion of several regulators. Further systematic analysis of changes in the transcriptional regulatory network of MGB874 cells in relation to protein productivity should facilitate the generation of improved B. subtilis cells as hosts of industrial protein production. We are in the process of introducing further rational deletions on the basis of transcriptome data, gene function information, and comparative genomics, with a view to generating simple, predictable cells comprising genes with defined functions as a new platform of development of bacterial strains for industrial use.FundingThis work is part of the subproject ‘Development of a Technology for the Creation of a Host Cell’ included within the industrial technology project ‘Development of Generic Technology for Production Process Starting Productive Function’ of the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry, entrusted by the New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO), Japan.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.We are grateful to Shu Ishikawa and Taku Oshima for help in transcriptome analysis and to Junichi Sekiguchi, Kouji Nakamura, and Fujio Kawamura for valuable discussions.

It suggests that besides σ28, there are certain up-regulatory mechanisms at the late stage, which may be involved in the chlamydial morphological change and thus pathogenesis.1. IntroductionChlamydia and Chlamydophila species cause serious health problems in both humans and animals. These obligatory intracellular bacteria have apparently two distinct forms: an extracellular, infectious, and unproliferative elementary body (EB) and an intracellular, proliferative, and uninfectious reticulate body (RB). The beginning of infection is an attachment and internalization of EBs into host cells, followed by differentiation to RBs, defined as an early stage. RBs proliferate by binary fission in an inclusion at the mid-stage. After the proliferation, RBs change back to EBs at the late stage, and finally EBs are released from host cells for the next infection cycle. Accompanied with the morphological change during the late stage, chlamydial transcription and DNA replication are inactivated, and the nucleoid is condensed like heterochromatin of eukaryotic cells.Chlamydophila pneumoniae is a causative agent of pneumonia and bronchitis of human1 and may contribute to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.2 To understand the pathogenesis, especially the mechanism of persistent infection, it is important to elucidate the molecular events in chlamydial development from RBs to EBs during the late stage, which may be related to the pathogenesis of atherosclerosis.3 The morphological conversion at the late stage is unique in chlamydia and thus the contributing genes could be targets for anti-chlamydosis therapy.Chlamydiae have eukaryotic-type histone-like proteins, Hc1 and Hc2, encoded by hctA and hctB genes, respectively. Both proteins are produced specifically during the late stage and known to be associated with the concentrated nucleoid of EB.4–10 Promoter of hctB is recognized by σ28, one of the alternative sigma factors in Chlamydia.11 Thus, σ28 is thought to play a role in late expression of genes in the developmental cycle. Recently, it was reported that tlyC_1, bioY, dnaK, fmu, and pgk genes are recognized by chlamydial σ28in vitro.12 The omcAB operon, ltuA, and ltuB genes are also known as late genes.13So far there are two reports showing gene expression profile of Chlamydophila trachomatis during its development using a DNA microarray.14,15 Seventeen genes, including the known late genes such as hctB, ltuB, omcA, and omcB, are commonly annotated as late genes. However, the reports include discrepancies in expression annotation for many genes, especially for early-stage genes. It may indicate a technical difficulty to analyze chlamydial transcriptome in the early and mid phases of infection with DNA microarray. In spite of these intensive researches, molecular mechanism of chlamydial development is still unclear. In the present study, we developed C. pneumoniae DNA microarray covering nearly all genes on the genome of C. pneumoniae J13816 and focused on analysis of the mid to late stage of chlamydial gene expression.2. Materials and methods2.1. Cell and chlamydia cultureInfection, culture, and DNA preparation of C. pneumoniae J138 were performed as previously described.17 Briefly, HEp-2 cells (ATCC CCL-23), a human epithelioid larynx carcinoma-derived cell line, were maintained using Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium (Gibco BRL, CA, USA) supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum (FCS) (PAA Laboratories, Inc., USA) and 10 µg gentamicin per milliliter. HEp-2 cells grown in 6-well tissue culture plates for 24 h after passage were infected with 1 × 106 inclusion forming unit (IFU) of C. pneumoniae per well, resulting in multiplicity of infection of 0.5. The inoculum was centrifuged at 700g for 1 h at 22°C followed by incubation at 36°C with 5% CO2 for one more hour. After the extracellular bacteria were removed, infected cells were further incubated in the same medium without 5% of FCS and addition of 1.0 µg/mL cycloheximide (Sigma, St. Louis, MO, USA). Growth curve of C. pneumoniae was determined as IFU by counting inclusion bodies cultured on a 96-well plate as described previously.18 Genomic DNA was extracted from purified organisms with EZ1 DNA Tissue Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany).2.2. C. pneumoniae DNA microarrayWe developed a DNA microarray composed of 884 DNA fragments covering 986 genes, except 83, from the C. pneumoniae J138 genome. Of the 884 DNA fragments, 497 cover one chlamydial gene or 23S rDNA in each fragment, and the other 387 contain plural genes since a part of the DNA fragments were prepared using clones for random sequencing of C. pneumoniae J138 genome.16 Negative control DNA fragments are prepared with adk gene from Pseudomonas putida mt-2, and two human cDNA of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and β-actin. DNA fragments were prepared with polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and spotted to two positions on a microarray glass.2.3. Preparation of fluorescent-labeled probes and DNA microarray analysisTotal RNA was purified from cells both infected and uninfected with C. pneumoniae J138 using RNeasy (QIAGEN). Chlamydial RNA was enriched by removing host mRNA and rRNA from the total RNA with magnetic beads of MicrobEnrich kit (Ambion, TX, USA).19 Fluorescent-labeled cDNA probe was prepared using RNA as the template with Atlas PowerScript Fluorescent Labeling Kit (BD Biosciences Clontech, CA, USA), Cy3, and Cy5 dye (Amersham). Fluorescent-labeled genomic DNA was prepared using 100 ng of purified chlamydial genomic DNA as the template with random prime method using BioPrime DNA Labeling System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), dNTPs (Amersham, NJ, USA) and aminoaryl-dUTP (Sigma), instead of biotin-dCTP and Cy3 or Cy5 dye (Amersham). After PCR for aminoaryl-dUTP incoporation, the reaction was terminated with ethanol precipitation. DNA resuspended within 0.1 M sodium hydrogencarbonate was mixed with the same volume of Cy3 or Cy5 dye solution dissolved in DMSO. After incubation at 37°C for 1 h, labeled DNA probes were purified with QIAquick PCR purification kit (QIAGEN). This method provides fluorescent-labeled genomic DNA probe sufficient for two or more times of hybridization. When the genomic DNA probe was hybridized to the DNA microarray, 15 of total 1768 chlamydial spots were removed for further analysis due to under-detectable intensity.Separately fluorescence-labeled cDNA probe and the genomic DNA were mixed and hybridized competitively to a microarray glass at 60°C for 16 h, as previously described.20 After washing, the glass was scanned with FLA-8000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo). Threshold of each experiment was determined as an average plus a value of standard deviation from negative spot intensities. Only spots with higher fluorescent intensity than the threshold were further analyzed. Gene expression value at each spot was calculated as a ratio of intensity of cDNA fluorescence against that of genomic DNA.To normalize and compare data from each RNA preparation, ompA gene was adopted as a continuously expressing standard due to the following reasons. First, global normalization using neither mean nor median is not appropriate for our data, because the detection rate varies remarkably from the time of infection (Fig. 1A). Secondly, microarray spots for chlamydial 23S rRNA showed non-specific signals derived from host RNA, and the amount of chlamydial rRNA was affected by MicrobEnrich treatment which is unavoidable for a reliable chlamydial DNA microarray analysis (data not shown). Thirdly, gene expression pattern of the ompA was similar to one of the chlamydial ribosomal RNA based on the reverse transcriptase–PCR (RT–PCR) analysis when no MicrobEnrich treatment was carried out (Supplementary Fig. S2C). At last, the ompA gene was detected with the DNA microarray at all points analyzed, and the amount of the ompA gene transcript was not affected by treatment with MicrobEnrich (data not shown).Gene expression analysis with DNA microarray.

Quantitative RT–PCRQuantitative RT–PCR was carried out with total RNA extracted from infected cells using QuantiTect SYBR Green RT–PCR Kit (QIAGEN) with LightCycler (Roche). In the RT–PCR, total RNA was directly submitted to RT reaction without the MicrobEnrich treatment. Therefore, signals of chlamydial rRNA were used as references, and with this rRNA reference, it was confirmed that the ompA gene is continuously expressed. RNA purified from the cells at 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 h after infection was diluted appropriately for assay, and was mixed with primers and reagents. Primer sequences used in this work are summarized in Supplementary Table S1. The reaction was performed according to the manuals from suppliers. Expression amount of each gene was normalized with that of chlamydial 16S rRNA.2.5. Clustering and statistical analysisData were normalized by median of each gene before clustering. Clustering analysis of the data was performed with ‘Cluster’,21 and the results were viewed with ‘TreeView’. Statistical comparisons were made using Wilcoxon's t-test and Mann–Whitney's U-test for analysis of the DNA microarray data and Chi square test for gene deviation analysis. P-value of <0.05 were considered significant.3. Results3.1. Chlamydial DNA microarray analysisTo distinguish the mid and late stages in the intracellular development of C. pneumoniae J138, the timing of progeny production was examined prior to analyzing gene expression during differentiation from EBs to RBs. The number of re-infectious progenies starts to increase between 36 and 48 hours post-infection (hpi) of C. pneumoniae J138 to HEp-2 cells (Fig. 1). Thus, in this work, the late stages in developmental cycle were defined after 48 hpi.When RNAs are prepared from chlamydia infection samples, amount of host RNA contamination is generally critical for data sensitivity and reliability. To reduce host cell RNA from total RNA, MicrobEnrich Kit was adopted to enrich chlamydial RNA before labeling, and the J138 genomic DNA was used as a counter control of the RNA to be tested. As with the RNA at 24 hpi, approximately 30% of chlamydial spots (total of 1768 spots by duplication of 884 DNA fragments covering 986 genes) exhibited higher fluorescence intensity than a threshold. At 60 hpi, 1508 spots were detected and the ratio of positive spots increased up to 93.8%, whereas 1608 spots were detected with genomic DNA as reference spots for cDNA (Fig. 1). The low detection ratio with RNAs from 24 hpi may be due to low concentration of chlamydial RNA in the total RNA, which still contains certain amount of the host RNA even after enrichment of chlamydial RNA using MicrobEnrich Kit. At earlier time point than 24 hpi fluorescent signals on the array were critically weak and the data were much less reliable than that after 24 hpi. Herein, we have focused on gene expression between mid and late stages (24–72 hpi).3.2. Genome-wide gene expression analyses with chlamydial DNA microarrayUsing chlamydial RNA-enriched RNA samples at 24–72 hpi, stage-specific gene expression was analyzed with external and internal controls, which were C. pneumoniae J138 genomic DNA and ompA gene product, respectively. The spots without genomic DNA signals were eliminated from the data analyses as detection errors. Relatively strong and constitutive ompA gene expression was adopted as an internal control to normalize individual experiments of DNA microarray analysis (for detail, see Section 2). Out of 1768 spots duplicated by 884 DNA fragments carrying a total of 986 genes of C. pneumoniae J138, the amount of detected spots were varied at 24–72 hpi, such as only 30% of whole spots were detected at 24 hpi while the maximum detection rate, 85% (1508 positive spots), was observed using 60 hpi RNA sample (Fig. 1). In order to screen late-stage-specific genes, duplicated spots for each DNA fragment were treated as two individual spots, and a clustering analysis was performed using the data of approximately 400 out of 1768 spots, intensities of which were higher than threshold at any time point (Fig. 2A).Clustering analysis of microarray data. (A) The data were normalized with ompA expression as described under Section 2. A hierarchical cluster was obtained by analysis of 440 data.

(B) A magnified view of a cluster in a rectangle with a broken line in the (A). Spot names (S01–S23) and gene IDs (CPjXXXX) are represented on the right side.The result from the clustering analysis indicates that expression of most genes tends to diminish from mid to late stage of infection. Approximately a half of the genes is drastically down-regulated, and the other half of the genes is constitutive or gradually decreased. In contrast, 22 spots, including duplicated spots for same DNA fragments, exhibited an upward trend with respect to time as a cluster collected on one side of the clustering result (box in Fig. 2A and B). A total of 17 genes in the 22 spots were assigned as candidates of the late genes and compared with results reported previously, including a proteomic analysis in Table 1.Summary of DNA microarray and RT–PCR analysesLate, late-stage gene; NL, not-late-stage genes (mid or constitutive genes); NC, not clustered in Fig. 2A; I, class I; II, class II; Const., constitutive in Fig. 3; ND, not determined.aThe classifications follow the cited reference.bOrtholog of C. trashomatis represented as gene number. ‘ − ’, no ortholog.cMurata et al (2006).Summary of DNA microarray and RT–PCR analysesLate, late-stage gene; NL, not-late-stage genes (mid or constitutive genes); NC, not clustered in Fig. 2A; I, class I; II, class II; Const., constitutive in Fig. 3; ND, not determined.aThe classifications follow the cited reference.bOrtholog of C. trashomatis represented as gene number. ‘ − ’, no ortholog.cMurata et al (2006).Clustering analysis of RT–PCR data.

Identification of late genes by quantitative RT–PCRExpression profiles of the 17 genes classified as late genes based on the DNA microarray were analyzed with quantitative RT–PCR using RNA harvested at 24, 36, 48, 60, and 72 hpi (Supplementary Fig. S2). Fourteen (82%) of the 17 genes were confirmed to be induced at the late stage (Table 1). However, the other three genes, CPj0148, CPj0934, and CPj0935, were constitutive in the RT–PCR analysis. The DNA fragment containing CPj0934 and CPj0935 for the DNA microarray also carries CPj0933, which is consistently categorized into the late gene (S14–S17 in Fig. 2B).Expressions of other 11 genes, which were not categorized into the late genes in the microarray analysis, were also examined with quantitative RT–PCR. CPj0466 (pmp15, polymorphic outer membrane protein E family) and CPj0679 (pgk, phosphoglycerate kinase) were reported as late-stage genes in C. trachomatis gene expression and C. pneumoniae proteome analysis.14,22 CPj0244 (adk gene) was tested because the gene product adenylate kinase (AK) was reported to increase in protein amount in the RB–EB transition stage of C. pneumoniae.22 Four genes, CPj0878 (set, SET domain protein), CPj0769 (topA, DNA topoisomerase I-fused to SWI domain), CPj0886 (hctA, histone-like developmental protein), and CPj0384 (hctB, histone-like protein 2), which are partially similar to eukaryotic chromatin structure regulation or polycomb complex proteins, were also reported as late-stage genes10,15,22 Here, we tested one more gene, CPj0577 (SWIB complex protein), which is eukaryotic chromatin structure regulation or polycomb complex proteins. CPj0678 (hypothetical protein) and CPj0559 (CT444.1 hypothetical protein) were tested to distinguish their expression from adjacent genes CPj0679 and CPj0558, respectively. CPj0695 (ompA, major outer membrane protein) and CPj0238 (zwf, glucose-6-P dehyrogenase) were tested as controls for constitutive expression.A total of 28 genes were examined with quantitative RT–PCR using RNA harvested at 24–72 hpi (Supplementary Fig. S2). These 28 genes were divided into three clusters based on the results of the clustering analysis (Fig. 3, Table 1, Supplementary Fig. S2A). Eight genes were categorized as class I genes that were induced sharply (more than five times induction ratio) at the late stage, 12 genes were class II genes induced moderately (from two to five times) at the late stage, and the other eight were constitutive genes. Out of the 20 late genes, hctA, hctB, adk, and CPj0710 are known as late genes in C. pneumoniae,10,22 and other 16 genes are identified as novel late genes.3.4. Conserved sequences in the late genesChlamydial gene expression at the late stage has been analyzed using C. trachomatis, and it has been proposed that σ28 RNA polymerase is involved in the late gene expression.12,23,24 We compared upstream sequences of the C. pneumoniae late genes identified here. Four out of the eight class I genes, hctB, ltuB, CPj0332, and adk, contain similar sequences to the −35 consensus of Escherichia coli σ28 promoter at approximately 60 nucleotides upstream of each putative translation initiation site of gene25 (Fig. 4A). It has been reported that AT-rich sequence upstream of promoter is one of the σ28 preferences by Shen et al.24 In fact, these genes have an AT-rich sequence upstream of −35 consensus. These findings suggest that σ28 RNA polymerase transcribes these genes. However, the CGA motif for −10 σ28 promoter was not found except in the hctB gene, suggesting that the consensus sequence of chlamydial σ28 promoter is different from E. coli.Consensus sequence upstream of class I late genes.

Asterisks represent conserved nucleotides in all genes in each species. Highly conserved regions in C. pneumoniae genes are boxed with dashed lines. Sequence logos are generated with WebLogo (http://weblogo.berkeley.edu/) using aligned sequences of C. pneumoniae genes.The other four genes in class I, CPj0331, CPj0678, omcA, and hctA, contain no sequences similar to the typical σ28 promoter, but a conserved AT-rich sequence, AnAAnAnTTnTATTTTCTnTT, approximately 100 nucleotides upstream from each predicted gene start site (Fig. 4B). The conserved AT-rich sequence was not found in other class I, class II, and constitutive genes determined with RT–PCR. Moreover, a part of the AT-rich sequence, such as TAnnTTC, was also found upstream of the orthologous genes of C. trachomatis. It may suggest that the AT-rich sequence (or a part of it) is conserved in the distinctive chlamydial genera and may be involved in late gene expression of the orthologues.Unlike hctB gene, adk and ltuB genes of C. trachomatis have no σ28 consensus sequence, even though ltuB gene of C. trachomatis is also a late gene. There is no orthologous gene of CPj0332 in C. trachomatis genomes. These differences between C. pneumoniae and C. trachomatis suggest two possibilities: one is that σ28 of these bacteria is capable of recognizing the distinct sequence and/or regulates the distinct set of genes, and the other is that there is a distinct regulation mechanism for late expression in each species.The late genes, CPj0331, CPj0332, and ltuB (CPj0333), are tandem located on a same strand, separated by 220, 141, and 95 bp intergenic spaces upstream of these genes, respectively. Our results revealed that upstream non-coding regions of ltuB and CPj0332 contain σ28 promoter-like sequences, suggesting that these two promoters are individually recognized by σ28 RNA polymerase.4. DiscussionHere we describe a transcriptome profile of C. pneumoniae in the late stage of the infection using DNA microarray and quantitative RT–PCR. Based on the DNA microarray screening, 17 C. pneumoniae genes were nominated as up-regulated genes in the late stage of infection, whereas approximately half of the genes analyzed are constitutively expressed through infection and the other half were down-regulated in the late stage. The 17 genes shown as late genes by the DNA microarray and 11 genes predicted as late genes based on its sequence and functional similarities to genes expressed in late stage in other chlamydial species were analyzed with quantitative RT–PCR. As a result, a total of 20 genes (14 out of the 17 genes and six of the 11 genes) were confirmed as late genes. Previously, we demonstrated that hctA, hctB, and set genes of C. pneumoniae are expressed at the late stage of infection.10 AK encoded by adk gene and product of Cpn0710, an orthologue of CPj0710, have been identified to be increased in the RB–EB transition stage of C. pneumoniae.22 Thus, except for these genes, we identified 16 novel late genes in this study. Expression of ompB, adk, and Cpn0710 genes are increased by interferon-γ (IFN-γ) treatment.26,27 These findings indicate that there are some mechanisms shared by molecular systems leading to the persistent infection (RBs to atypical RBs) induced by IFN-γ and to the late stage (RBs to EBs). The 20 late genes were divided into two classes by the clustering analysis: eight sharply induced genes (class I) and 12 moderately up-regulated genes (class II). The class I genes, hctA, hctB, omcA, ltuB, adk, CPj0678, CPj0331, and CPj0332, begin to be induced synchronously when the conversion from RBs to EBs starts at around 48 hpi. As hctA and hctB genes are believed to contribute to the transition of RBs to EBs, somehow other six class I genes may play their roles or explain the cellular status in the late stage.Four genes (hctB, ltuB, adk, and CPj0332) out of eight class I genes contain the upstream sequences which may be recognized by σ28 RNA polymerase, supporting the hypothesis that σ28 RNA polymerase is responsible for late gene expression.12,23,24 However, the late gene, ltuB, of C. trachomatis does not have the σ28 consensus sequence, suggesting a distinct mechanism, which allows the late expression of the gene without σ28 in C. trachomatis.In contrast, the other four genes of class I (CPj0331, omcA, CPj0678, and hctA) have no σ28 promoter-like sequence, suggesting the presence of other mechanism(s) of late expression. Instead, we found a common AT-rich sequence around −100 nucleotides upstream of them (Fig. 4B), suggesting that it plays a role in late expression. In addition, the sequence was also conserved partially upstream of the orthologous genes of C. trachomatis. This sequence is not similar to the known promoter sequences and far from each gene. In fact, the core TAnnTTC of C. trachomatis hctA gene is located at −45 to −51 from the transcription initiation site.13 Therefore, it might be a binding site of regulatory protein(s) rather than a promoter sequence.AK catalyzes a reversible high-energy phosphoryl transfer reaction between adenosine triphosphate (ATP) and AMP to generate ADP and is considered to contribute to the homeostasis of cellular adenine nucleotide composition in the cell.17 There might be two possible reasons why the adk gene is up-regulated at the late stage of infection: one is that AK is necessary to increase ATP concentration or to decrease ADP concentration, and the other is that it is necessary to decrease AMP concentration. In the first case, AK produces ATP and AMP from ADP. Because a Km (Michaelis constant) value for AMP of the AK is remarkably higher than other AKs,17 accumulation of AMP seems not to affect the reaction. In the second case, ADP is produced to consume AMP through the opposite reaction. Because ADP is a substrate of chlamydial ADP/ATP translocase, it could promote to get ATP from the host cell. We cannot conclude here which is more likely. However, in many organisms intracellular adenine nucleotide balance is strictly regulated, and change of the balance induces various responses in the cell, including not only metabolism regulation, but also cell differentiation. In Bacillus subtilis increase of ADP (or low ATP/ADP ratio) is hypothesized to be a cell differentiation signal for sporulation.28 Therefore, also in C. pneumoniae the change of adenine nucleotide balance could induce not only adk gene, but also other late genes to differentiate RB into EB.In the class II genes, himD gene encoding a subunit of histone-like protein integration host factor and pmp15 gene encoding outer membrane protein are up-regulated transiently at 60 hpi. This temporary enhancement of expression was consistent with the results of binding assay in vitro using an extract from C. trachomatis reported by Zhong et al.29 Expression of set gene encoding SET domain protein has been previously reported to be expressed during late stage accompanied with one of hctA and hctB genes,10 suggesting that it plays an important role in chlamydial development by the chlamydial histone-like protein modification.Recently, OmcB protein of C. trachomatis, one of the products of late omcAB operon, has been revealed to be a surface-exposed adhesion to infect the host cell.30 Likewise, other membrane proteins encoded by late genes identified here, omcA, pmp14, pmp15, and ompB, might function to attach to the host cell.In this study, we have identified 16 novel late genes of C. pneumoniae and predicted cis-acting sequences common in upstream regions of the late genes. The genome sequence of Chlamydia contained a small number of regulatory systems, a single pair of bacterial two-component system, and only several transcription factors. However, our results suggest that regulation of gene expression in C. pneumoniae might be more complicated than expected. Further investigation using a DNA microarray may help to understand chlamydial physiology and pathology.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis study was supported by the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science, Research for the Future Program (JSPS-RETF00L01411), and a Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan (KAKEN-HI: 14770063 and 16790255).We thank Taku Oshima (Nara Inst.

IntroductionLegumes have begun to draw much attention through recent genomic and phylogenetic studies.1 The crop legumes, such as Lotus, Medicago, Pisum, Glycine, Phaselous, and Vigna, also receive attention from researchers because they are economically important.2 Asian countries have a long history of making different food products, such as soymilk, tofu, soybean sprouts, etc., with soybean seeds because its seed obtains high protein and oil content. Thus, soybean is considered a very valuable crop among legumes.3 As approximately 20 000 species belong in the legume family, a wide range of genetic and morphological diversities can be observed.2 Unlike many other plants, legumes have a symbiotic relationship with the soil-borne bacteria, Rhizobia. Medicago truncatula and Lotus japonicus were selected as model legume plants because these legumes had not only plant–Rhizobium interactions for nitrogen fixation but also small genomes suitable for full genome sequencing.4,5Most Papilionoids are diploids except Glycine. An ancient genome duplication occurred in Glycine, leading to 2n = 38, 40 or 78–80 depending on annual/perennials or geographic locations.6,7 Polyploidy has had an evolutionary impact on the structure of the soybean genome.8–10 Using restriction fragment-length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis with nine populations (Glycine max × G. soja and G. max × G. max) of the Glycine subgenus soja, it was shown that the soybean genome presents about 2.55 copies per digest. This suggests that an additional round of genome duplication might have occurred in at least one of the original genomes.8Other studies have supported those observations. RFLP and simple sequence repeat (SSR) analyses showed that parts of linkage groups (LGs) B1/S, H, and F of soybean genome shared homoeologous regions.9 Other genetic mapping analysis suggested that extensive rearrangements and additional duplications were present in soybean genome.10 Also, high similarity in physical organization between soybean duplicated regions and a high percentage of microsynteny were shown by characterizing bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC) clones of soybean and other model plants.11,12 In addition, BACs containing FAD2 genes also contained a number of syntenic genes and were positioned on LG I and O, again indicating duplication of soybean genome.13 Fluorescence in situ hybridization of BACs visualized segmental duplications within the soybean genome.14M. truncatula genome also presents segmental duplications identified by high-throughput genome sequencing.15The processes of genome evolution and patterns of divergence can be studied by duplicate gene analysis.16 Because the full genome sequence of many plants is not yet available, ESTs provide resources for studying evolutionary events such as ancient bursts of gene duplications. Because the accumulation of synonymous substitutions occurs stochastically over time, the level of divergence (age of duplication) is estimated by nucleotide substitution in coding sequences2,17 Putative genome duplications events were identified with large EST collections from eight plant species using synonymous substitution measurements (Ks) of duplicated genes.18 Soybean was estimated to have had two major genome duplications events at 15 million years ago (MYA) and 44 MYA. A genome duplication event also was observed in M. truncatula at ∼58 MYA. With different calibration, duplications also were observed in both soybean and M. truncatula.17 A mutigene approach combined with a phylogenetic approach suggested soybean and Medicago shared a round of gene duplications, along with about 7000 other legume plants.19Xanthomonas axonopodis pv. glycine (Xag) causes bacterial leaf pustule (BLP) in soybean that occurs in Korea and the southern United States, where hot and humid weather conditions are prevalent.20 Typically, small yellow-to-brown lesions with a raised lesion are formed in early development and develop into large necrotic lesions causing substantial losses in yield through premature defoliation.21–24Twenty consensus LGs of soybean genome, representing the 20 soybean chromosomes, were reported25 with a joined map from three different populations spanning 2400 cM in length. A total of 420 SSR markers were added to the integrated genetic linkage map and its length was expanded to 2523.6 cM of Kosambi map distance across 20 LGs.26 And, 1141 single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers were later located on the soybean genetic map.27 Among 20 LGs, we are interested in LG D2 because the recessive gene conditioning resistance to BLP, rxp,28 was mapped to LG D2 only 3.9 cM away from Satt372.29 Also, the Rxp locus linked to the malate dehydrogenase (Mdh) locus with an estimated recombination frequency of 15.2 ± 3.8%.30 In the process of BAC clone selection for ‘chromosome walking’ around Rxp region, we were able to create two contigs, which represent homoeologous regions of the soybean genome. Here, we describe the consequences of the duplication events around the Rxp region. Annotation, gene arrangement, and evolution events estimated by Ks (the number of synonymous substitution per synonymous site) will also be presented.2. Methods2.1. Primary BAC library screeningThe constructed ‘Iowa State’ BAC library of soybean ‘Williams 82’ (gmw1)31 was used for selection of BAC clones around Rxp locus. For the first round of PCR-based library screening, Satt 372 (forward, 5′-CAG AAA AGG AAT AAT AAC AAC ATC AC-3′; reverse, 5′-GCG AAA ACA TAA TTC ACA CAA AAG ACA G-3′), Satt486 (forward, 5′-GCG CAT GCA TTA CCA TAG GCT ATA ATA -3′; reverse, 5′-GGG GTC ATG CAT AAT AGA GAT AGA ACC A-3′), and Satt498 (forward, 5′-CAA CCC CGA AAT ACA ACT AAT GTT-3′; reverse, 5′-TGG TGA GGC TCA TTT TCA TAA GA-3′) were used as PCR primers, and pooled DNAs made by copies of the library by combining the overnight cell culture31 were used as templates.Basic PCR protocols were followed as described with minor alternations,31 using a PTC-110 Peltier Thermal Cycler (MJ Research, Inc., Watertown, MA, USA). The components of the reaction mixture in 20 µL of total volume were 0.5 U of Taq polymerase (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the rests of components were the same.31 Cycling conditions started with initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 48°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 30 s and the final step was at 72°C for 2 min. The amplified PCR products were analyzed in 1.5% ethidium bromide-stained agarose.Several rounds of the BAC library were screened systematically with in order, full-plate super pool DNA, individual full-plate pools, row and column super pools, and row and column pools. All PCRs were performed as describe earlier and DNA of ‘Williams 82’ was used as positive control for all screening processes.2.2. Shotgun plasmid library and DNA sequencingAfter BAC DNAs were prepared by a Plasmid Midi Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and the insert size of each selected BAC clone was estimated,31 the random plasmid library for shotgun sequencing was constructed with 10–15 µg of the extracted BAC clone DNA and pUC118 vector using Takara BKL Kit (Takara Bio, Inc., Otsu, Japan). The rest of methods were performed as described previously.32Full sequencing of each BAC DNA was performed with the BigDye Terminator (v. 3.1) cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). Cycle conditions for sequencing and analysis of BAC sequences were described.32 Also, the individual sequences were assembled with Phred/Phrap software and the remaining gaps of each clone were closed by direct sequencing, using plasmid DNA.32 Image v. 3.0 and FPC v. 4.7.9 were used for confirmation of BAC contig assignment.33,342.3. Secondary BAC library screening and sequence analysisAfter the sequences of each BAC clone were aligned,35 BAC end sequences (BES) were selected for extending BAC contigs. Primer3 program36 was used to design primers for secondary BAC library screening. With primers derived from BES, the BAC library screening was performed again as described earlier. Addition to ‘Iowa State’ BAC library, ‘Missouri’ soybean BAC library (gmw2) consisted of BstyI partially digested ‘Williams 82’ DNA was also used for screening.37After BAC contigs were confirmed, alignment between BAC contigs and its alignment results were inspected with GBrowse (http://www.gmod.org/?q=node/71) and SynBrowse (http://www.synbrowse.org/). Also, gene annotation was conducted with the web-based gene prediction programs FGENESH (http://sun1.softberry.com/berry.phtml) and GeneMark (http://exon.gatech.edu/GeneMark/) against Medicago (legume plant) database. Putative amino acid sequences from the predicted genes were used as queries for searching similar known proteins using BLASTP. With each predicted gene of GmA at first, EST information was searched against G. max EST database at G. max Genome Database (http://bionary.agry.purdue.edu/GmaxGDB/index.php). Nucleotide blast or tblastn (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/blast/Blast.cgi) was also used for searching EST information with each predicted gene of GmA′ or MtA, if no ESTs corresponding to the predicted genes in GmA were identified.The rate of non-synonymous nucleotide substitution (Ka) and the fraction of synonymous substitutions (Ks) were obtained with the CODEML program38 of the PAML package.39Ks was used to estimate the divergence time between two sequences. So, coding sequences of the predicted gene from two contigs were used for analysis of Ks, as described.35 Divergence times (T) were calculated using a synonymous mutation rate of 6.1 × 10−9 substitutions per synonymous site per year18,40 as T = Ks/(2 × 6.1 × 10−9).2.4. SNP detection, SNP genotyping, and generation of linkage mapTo locate each BAC contig in LGs, contig-specific regions longer than 4.5 kb were surveyed. Seven different primer sets (Supplementary Table S1) were designed from these contig-specific regions using Primer3 (http://primer3.sourceforge.net/). And, the detection of SNP in the contig-specific regions between two soybean genotypes, Pureunkong and Jinpumkong 2, was followed.3SNP capture probe (5′-GTT TTT TCA TCA ATC TTC CTC TAA A-3′) was designed to be complementary to the 5′ region from the SNP site within an amplicon using SBEPrimer version 1.141 and single base extension reactions followed by fluorescence polarization (FP) measurements were performed on a Victor3 microplate reader (PerkinElmer Life Science, Boston, MA, USA).42 SNP primers were tested using genomic DNA of each parent and a mixture of both parents as artificial heterozygotes. The SNP primer was accepted as an SNP marker, only if the results of genotyping by AcycloPrime FP analysis were confirmed by sequencing data and then used for genotyping in a segregating population, an F2-derived soybean population of 90 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) from the cross of Pureunkong and Jinpumkong 2.43Genotyping data were automatically transferred to Microsoft Excel and the genotypes of the segregation population were determined, if the clusters were separated at least 40 mp (thousandth of the polarization unit) apart, at least seven times higher than standard deviation of the negatives (>99% at significant level).44 The construction of the linkage map with SNP marker genotyping data and integration of these markers on LGs were followed.43 SNP genotyping data from the heterozygous line were considered as missing data. The five SSRs located on GmA′ sequences were additionally used for accurate mapping of GmA′, after the SSRs were identified by Sputnik: DNA microsatellite repeat search utility (http://cbi.labri.fr/outils/Pise/sputnik.html). LGs were designated according to the USDA genetic map,26 and MapChart v. 2.1 was used for generation of linkage map.452.5.

Sequence data from this article can be found in the GenBank/EMBL data libraries.3. Results3.1. Identification of soybean duplicated regions by BAC selectionTo obtain BAC clones around the Rxp locus, we screened the gmw1 BAC library with three SSR markers, Satt372, Satt486, and Satt498. Among a total of six BAC clones identified by these SSR markers, we selected gmw1-29F06 and gmw1-24M16 for determining DNA sequences because they represented an SSR marker with long length (Fig. 1).Schematic relationships between homologous regions (GmA and GmA′) containing the Rxp locus from LGs A1 (red) and D2 (blue). The positions (in cM) and their corresponding SSR markers are located on the upper and lower sides of the black solid and dashed bars for LG D2 and A1, respectively. Linkage map of LG D2 was taken from the Soybean Breeders Toolbox (http://soybase.org) and the mapped position of GmA′ is shown on the detailed genetic linkage map of LG A1 in the RIL population of Pureunkong × Jinpumkong 2. GmA was composed of gmw1-29F06 and gmw1-24M16. gmw1-20O10, gmw1-89M01 and gmw2-77P21 were made GmA′.Schematic relationships between homologous regions (GmA and GmA′) containing the Rxp locus from LGs A1 (red) and D2 (blue). The positions (in cM) and their corresponding SSR markers are located on the upper and lower sides of the black solid and dashed bars for LG D2 and A1, respectively. Linkage map of LG D2 was taken from the Soybean Breeders Toolbox (http://soybase.org) and the mapped position of GmA′ is shown on the detailed genetic linkage map of LG A1 in the RIL population of Pureunkong × Jinpumkong 2. GmA was composed of gmw1-29F06 and gmw1-24M16. gmw1-20O10, gmw1-89M01 and gmw2-77P21 were made GmA′.DNA sequences of gmw1-29F06 and gmw1-24M16 were aligned and created the GmA contig, comprised of 264 239 bp, including overlapped DNA sequences of ∼73 kb (Fig. 1). Primers were then designed from BES of GmA for extending the contig. Clone gmw1-20O10 (120 kb) was selected from BES of gmw1-29F06 and primers designed from BES from gmw1-24M16 selected gmw1-89M01 to create an apparent extension of 175 kb. We were able to extend the contig longer with full sequenced gmw1-20O10 and gmw1-89M01 clones.The full DNA sequences of gmw1-20O10 and gmw1-89M01 were compared with GmA, but DNA sequences of the expected overlapped regions showed only an approximate 90% match. To close the gap between gmw1-20O10 and gmw1-89M01, we were able to select gmw2-77P21 (94 kb) from another soybean BAC library, gmw2. After the DNA sequences of gmw2-77P21 were aligned with gmw1-20O10 and gmw1-89M01, the GmA′ contig (gmw1-20O10_ gmw2-77P21_ gmw1-89M01, 292 895 bp) was formed with 100% match (Fig. 1).3.2. Mapping of soybean duplicated regionsTo locate GmA′ on the soybean genetic linkage map, SNP genotyping was performed. First, unique regions longer than 4.5 kb in GmA′ were surveyed. Seven different unique regions were identified, and seven different primer sets were randomly designed from these seven contig-specific regions (Supplementary Table S1). One SNP locus between Pureunkong (deletion) and Jinpumkong 2 (A) was identified by primers (forward, 5′-TTC GTG CTA AGT GGA ACT TCT G-3′; reverse, 5′-TAC AAC AAC GAT GTT CAT GAC G-3′) designed between 159 723 and 160 465 bp of GmA′.SNP genotyping of GmA′ was conducted with the RIL population from the cross of Pureunkong and Jinpumkong 2. The SNP marker locus was incorporated into the frame map,43 placing GmA′ to the top of LG A1, 1.9 cM away from Satt684 in LG A1 (Fig. 1). Five SSRs identified by Sputnik on GmA′ were additionally analyzed. Only one designed SSR showed polymorphism between Pureunkong and Jinpumkong 2 (data not shown), and this was turned out to be Satt684, which was positioned between 64 495 and 64 682 bp of GmA′. On the basis of all genotyping and mapping data, we are able to determine that the duplicated regions are located on LG A1 for GmA′ and LG D2 for GmA (Fig. 1).3.3. Alignments, annotations, and Ks estimationAfter BAC contigs were confirmed and inspected with GBrowse and SynBrowse, genes were annotated with FGENESH or GeneMark against the Medicago database. Fig. 2 shows a schematic representation of approximate gene lengths, gene locations, and homologous regions (linked by shaded lines). The 54 and 58 genes were predicated in GmA and GmA′, respectively (Fig. 2). Gene density along these two sequenced BAC contigs was approximately one gene per 5.0 kb. A similar gene density (45 predicted genes along 219 028 bp) was also detected in Medicago along Contig 962B (MtA, as of January 2007 at http://www.medicago.org). The Medicago contig showed homology with the two soybean contigs. Gene order was conserved among syntenic blocks, except for one case (GmA_18 versus GmA′_10 and GmA_27 versus GmA′_10), and the same orientation between the predicted genes was observed. Gene order was maintained in Medicago, although linearity was fragmented (Fig. 2).Comparative genome alignments among M. truncatula (MtA) and G. max (GmA and GmA′) based on discontinuous Megablast results. Colored arrows (red, common genes between Medicago and soybean contigs; black, common genes between soybean contigs; gray, unique genes) indicate the positions and orientation of predicated genes and their length presents the length of predicated gene. And, their locations were linked among three contigs, if the predicted genes were founded on all contigs. Darker color is used in filled link as higher e-value between two contigs was shown (Supplementary Table S2). Numbers indicate the number of genes annotated by FGENESH. A detailed description of gene annotations is listed in Supplementary Table S2.Comparative genome alignments among M. truncatula (MtA) and G. max (GmA and GmA′) based on discontinuous Megablast results.

Darker color is used in filled link as higher e-value between two contigs was shown (Supplementary Table S2). Numbers indicate the number of genes annotated by FGENESH. A detailed description of gene annotations is listed in Supplementary Table S2.Supplementary Table S2 lists all pairwise comparisons of the predicted genes among homoeologous contigs. Segments showing no homology with known genes were excluded for this table. Also, the EST information corresponding to the predicted genes was included in Supplementary Table S2 after three BLAST programs, G. max Genome Database, nucleotide blast, and tblastn, were run. Eight regions were unique in GmA, whereas GmA′ had 13 unique regions. But, 22 among 45 segments of MtA were not similar to any of segments from the two soybean homoeologous regions. Twenty seven pairwise comparisons between soybean homoeologous regions were also observed in Supplementary Table S2. After each pairwise comparison was performed against BLASTP, nine of the 27 comparisons between soybean homoeologous regions showed >90% identity with putative genes with pretty low e-value. However, wide range of the conservation level was detected in the putative promoter regions and the introns between GmA and GmA′, averaging 59.7% and 54.9% in similarity for the putative promoter regions and the introns, respectively (Supplementary Table S2). Many homoeologous regions contained kinases and proteins related to signal transduction pathway. Interestingly, some unique segments from GmA and GmA′ showed homology with transposase (GmA′_07) or integrase (GmA_13, 14 and 15) (Supplementary Table S2). Among twenty seven pairwise comparisons between soybean homoeologous regions, nine comparisons showed alignment with MtA (Supplementary Table S2).Using the maximum-likelihood method in the CODEML program,39 synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) distance were estimated. This method was based on the F3 x 4 model of codon substitution,38 explaining both transition/transversion and codon usage biases. Supplementary Table S3 shows the results of analysis between homologous gene pairs from each contig, along with percent identity of amino acid and cDNA sequences. The median Ka value (0.0426) between two soybean contigs was about 3.5 times smaller than the median Ks value (0.1472). Only one case in the Ka/Ks ratio was higher than 1 (1.5479, GmA_39 versus GmA′_40) (Supplementary Table S3). This Ka/Ks ratio might be non-significant because of moderate length of exons (282, 51, and 159 bp). When the substitutions per synonymous site (Ks) were plotted against the fraction of duplication events, secondary peaks were observed in the distribution for two contigs (data not shown). The first secondary peak (mode Ks = 0.10–0.15) followed by two smaller bulges (mode Ks = 0.20–0.25 and 0.30–0.35) was displayed, indicating a burst of gene duplications in soybean. For GmA versus MtA, the median Ka value was 0.2888, which is 2.7 times smaller than the median Ks value (0.7755). MtA_12 showed homology with both GmA_21 and GmA_23. The Ks value for GmA_23 versus MtA_12 was extremely high because they aligned along 107 amino acids (Supplementary Table S3). The median Ka value (0.2876) between GmA′ and MtA was about 2.8 times smaller than the median Ks value (0.8003).To determine the timing of the duplication event giving rise to the two contigs, the Ks value was used. Synonymous substitutions are thought to be evolutionarily neutral because the mutations cause no amino acid change35 and therefore accumulate stochastically over time. Ks values less than 0.05 and greater than 1 were not included for searching for mixtures of normal distributions.19 Divergence times (T) were estimated with Ks value and assumption of a mutation rate of 6.1 × 10−9 substitutions per synonymous site per year.18,40T ranged from 5.55 to 39.92 MYA between GmA and GmA′, and the median T was 12.3 MYA with low Ks value (0.1498) (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S3). With MtA only included 0.05 <Ks < 1.0, median Ks values were 0.7654 (0.5986 to 0.9342) and 0.6877 (0.4592 to 0.9128) for GmA and GmA′, respectively. Therefore, MtA and the soybean homoeologous contigs diverged at 56.4–62.7 MYA (Fig. 3, Supplementary Table S3). The two soybean homoeologous contigs were duplicated more recently, agreeing with the previous study.17Ks values and estimation of evolutionary events in three contigs. The number shown above the self-comparison diagonal represents estimation of median Ks values.

Paleopolypoidy of the soybean genomeDiploidization or gene duplication is a process of switching from tetrasomic to disomic inheritance and a common process in plant genome evolution.13,46 Many studies have suggested that paleopolyploidy is a common phenomenon in most plant species.17,18 Previous studies suggested that the soybean genome has undergone two or more large-scale duplications and is probably an ancient polyploid.8,11,18,47 In the present study, we identified and evaluated the duplication events in soybean genome with two contigs. In the process of full DNA sequencing of BAC clones, nucleotide sequences of gmw1-20O10 and gmw1-89M01 were not aligned perfectly with GmA (gmw1-29F06_gmw1-24M16). Therefore, another round of BAC library screening was performed to close the gap between gmw1-20O10 and gmw1-89M01, and the GmA′ (gmw1-20O10_ gmw2-77P21_ gmw1-89M01) was made by selection of gmw2-77P21 (Fig. 1).Although BAC-end sequences were used for BAC by BAC selection, the alignment of our two contigs was not perfect and gaps in alignment were observed. To locate these two homologous contigs, SNP genotyping was performed with the one SNP between Pureunkong (deletion) and Jinpumkong 2 (A). This SNP marker locus for GmA′ was located 1.9 cM away from Satt684 on LG A1, which SSR marker analysis was also able to be positioned between 64 495 and 64 682 bp of GmA′ (Fig. 1). Linkage maps from the Soybean Breeders Toolbox (http://soybase.org) were compared to locate the duplicated region (GmA versus GmA′). A comparison between the soybean composite maps for LG A1 and D2 indicated that homoeologous regions exist between them. In addition to the two homoeologous contigs, five RFLP markers were also common between the two LGs. Therefore, it suggested that GmA and GmA′ are indeed homoeologous.4.2. Genome dynamics among homoeologous regionsBoth soybean homoeologous contigs showed a gene density of 1 gene per 5 kb in this present study (Fig. 2). The gene density of soybean on LG G was estimated with 28 BAC ends11 and subclone sequences from two contigs, to be approximately 1 gene per 14 kb. Arabidopsis and tomato showed similar gene density with an average of 1 gene per 5 kb, although more than a sevenfold difference in genome size is present between these two species.11,48 Wheat, barley, and rice were compared near the Lrk locus and showed maximal density as 1 gene per 4–5 kb.49The unusual relationship between physical distance and genetic distance for the homoeologous region on LG A1 was revealed by the comparison of the physical map and the genetic map in the distal region of LG A1 (Fig. 1). The physical distance between two markers (gmw1-89M01-32 and Satt684) on GmA′ was ∼100 kb, whereas its genetic distance was observed to be 1.9 cM on the physical map of LG A1. Exhibition of 52.6 kb/cM in a physical-to-genetic distance ratio in this homoeologous region might represent high recombination region because not only duplication of genes and dispersed gene duplicates, which was single-gene duplications that were on different chromosome, occurred more often in high-recombination regions50 but also the distal chromosomal regions showed high recombination rate.50 And, rice genome showed high recombination frequency with 244 kb as the average physical distance per centimorgan, although a physical-to-genetic distance ratio was different depending on position along the chromosome.51 High resolution mapping with various markers and genome sequencing would clarify the relationship between physical distance and genetic distance for this homoeologous region on LG A1.Genic regions of the two soybean contigs and MtA retained gene structure in both order and orientation (Fig. 2). Similar conservations were also observed.13,17,52 Sequence similarity was >60% in intergenic regions of most soybean homologous regions. This high level of similarity was also seen in previous studies,11,13,52 suggestive of either a relatively recent duplication or concerted evolution.53A homology search using BLASTP identified high homology with kinases and proteins related to signal transduction pathway within the homoeologous regions. Among them, the first aligned segment (GmA_01 versus GmA′_10) was very similar to putative receptor-like protein kinase INRPK1 (Ipomoea nil receptor-like protein kinase), which shows homology with Xa21, the rice pathogen recognition receptor.54 INRPK1 and Xa21, as typical RPKs, were composed of extracellular leucine-rich repeat domain, transmembrane domain, and cytoplasmic kinase domain. Twenty one dominant loci responsible for resistance to bacterial blight disease indicated that a multiple gene family was involved in resistance to Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae. And, sequence analysis between two classes of Xa21 defined by the predicted amino acid sequence level suggested duplication was one of the roles in evolution of the Xa21 gene family.55 So, like Xa21, the soybean homoeologous regions contained important genes related to plant defense could be duplicated. However, it is difficult to say that Rxp encodes RPK for recognition of pathogen (Xag) by the extracellular domain and transduction of pathogen attack by an intracellular kinase because INRPK1 showed only 30% of homology with Xa21 at the amino acid sequence level.Supplementary Table S2 provides the information on insertion/deletion of sequences in terms of genome dynamics in Medicago and soybean. Several blocks of segments from each contig showing no homology with any other homologous regions were identified, indicating insertion or deletion of sequences within homologous contigs. Some segments draw attention because they were similar to transposase from Medicago (GmA′_07) and integrase from Medicago (GmA_13, 14 and 15). Potential transposable element (TE) activity is interesting because TE could be used for transposon mutagenesis in gene cloning and functional genomics in plants.56,57 Many researchers have put efforts into identifying and cloning of soybean TE via finding the mutable alleles because no active TE has yet been isolated from soybean.57 The w4-mutable line contained an autonomous TE at the W4 locus and the unstable k2 Mdh1-n y20 chromosomal region caused by a non-autonomous TE were identified in soybean.57,58 Interestingly, this unstable chromosomal region was mapped on LG H and this Mdh gene also located on LG D2,30 near the Rxp locus studied in this research.4.3. Genome evolutionWith comparisons of the sequences of the same gene from two species or gene family, counting of the number of non-synonymous changes (amino acid sequences change) and synonymous change (no change of amino acids sequences) is a good indicator of the degree of divergence between two sequences.59 A total of 23 homologous regions between two soybean contigs showed Ka values ranging from 0.0168 to 0.2807 and Ks values ranging from 0.0318 to 0.4797 (Supplementary Table S3). It suggested that the Ka/Ks ratio could test for assessing the protein-coding potentials of genomic regions.60 Depending on Ks as the background rate of evolution, the selection pressure in protein-coding regions could be explained by deviations of this ratio.59 In this study, the ratio was less than 1 except for one comparison (GmA_39 versus GmA′_40) because of very low Ks. Short length of exons or highly divergent sequences (<70% nucleotide identity) could cause the Ka/Ks ratio to be higher than 1.60 Although their percentage of identity at nucleotide level was >95%, this homologous region (GmA_39 versus GmA′_40) showed very low Ks because of very short length of exon 2 (50 bp).Paleopolyploid species like soybean indicate the presence of duplications by showing secondary peaks in the age distributions of paralogous pairs.17 Three secondary peaks were observed in this study. Distributions were indicated with a major and first peak at mode Ks = 0.10–0.15. These data were consistent, and the first secondary peak at the same mode also identified after comparisons of pairs of paralogous genes in 14 model plant species including soybean.17 In addition, two minor bulges were identified in our study, indicating additional duplication events in this homologous region between two contigs.To estimate divergence time for gene duplication, the Ks values were used, assuming rates of synonymous substitution of 6.1 × 10−9 substitutions per synonymous site per year.18,40,61 This soybean homologous region was mainly duplicated at 12.3 MYA in this study and the speciation event of soybean from Medicago at 60 MYA was also suggested (Fig. 3), agreeing with the rapid diversification between 50–60 MYA in legumes.2,61 However, estimated ages of the secondary peaks could be different depending on the assumed substitution rates. It estimated a rate of silent-site substitution of 6.1 per silent site per billion years.18,40,61 But, a synonymous rate of 1.5 × 10−8 substitutions per synonymous site per year for dicots was used to calculate the absolute date for duplication events.17,62 With a synonymous rate of 1.5 × 10−8 substitutions, the average divergent time was 6.3 MYA in this study (median = 5.0 MYA), similar to estimation of the recent duplication (3.3–5.0 MYA) in soybean.17 However, these estimates are only approximations because the rate of synonymous substitution is different among genes and species and generation time is also the factor for controlling mutational rate.17Our study provides additional evidence of the paleopolyploidy of the soybean genome. We also showed that organization and sequence homology between duplicated segments were very similar. In this study, homoeologous regions were so similar that the contig on LG A1 was originally sequenced instead of that on LG D2, even though BAC-end sequences located near Rxp locus on LG D2 were used for BAC selection in genome sequencing. Thus, in future studies, to avoid walking in the wrong direction, BAC by BAC soybean genome sequencing should be performed in concert with whole-genome physical mapping because of high level of similarity between homologous contigs.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.This research was supported by a grant for genome sequencing funded by Agricultural R&D Promotion Center, Technology Development Program for Agriculture and Forestry, the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, the Republic of Korea, and in part by a grant (code no.

IntroductionThe advent of array technology and the subsequent development of high-density oligonucleotide arrays1 have been enormously helpful in improving our understanding of the genome-wide transcriptional profiles of many biological systems in both basic and applied research.2 Array technology has also been extremely useful for discovering and developing diagnostic gene markers for disease subcategories, disease prognosis, and treatment outcome; this has paved the way for effective pharmaceutical drug discovery, the development of novel strategies for molecular (DNA, RNA) diagnostics, and the design of personalized drug regimens.2Oligonucleotide microarrays, which were initially designed to analyze genome-wide gene expression levels, have turned out to be particularly useful in DNA diagnostics as they can be used for many different applications, including discovering polymorphisms and genotyping patients by identifying inheritable genetic markers.3 With regard to the latter applications, such DNA diagnostics have greatly improved our understanding of and ability to detect the causative mutations of various diseases. However, this technology is hampered by major ethical and privacy issues since the genome sequence of a person carries unchangeable private information whose discovery can affect the life of not only that person, but also to some extent their family members. The need to protect patient privacy upon DNA diagnostics testing and the practical problems this constitutes also imposes extra costs on the testing procedure. Moreover, many kinds of diseases are caused not only by the DNA polymorphism, but also by environmental status. These environmental factors can be reflected in the RNA status, but DNA diagnostics usually cannot provide enough information on the environments. Thus, the activity of the disease can be detected by RNA or protein level but not by DNA level.These problems are not faced by RNA diagnostics, in which the genome-wide mRNA levels are monitored by oligonucleotide (or cDNA) microarrays. Ethical issues of the nature described above do not apply here because the information obtained from RNA diagnostics does not necessarily relate to the DNA sequence. Instead, this technology monitors the dynamic changes in gene activities, namely, the increased or decreased transcriptional (mRNA) levels in the samples provided by the individual. The transcriptional levels would vary in the same individual depending on the health of the individual. In this sense, DNA diagnostics is a static test of the genome, whereas RNA diagnostics is a dynamic test of the genome.However, it is not possible to monitor all 44 000 kinds of mRNA species that are transcribed from the human genome for many samples at the same time. A novel way to circumvent this problem is to develop a ‘focused array’ in which a limited number of mRNAs are tested in a low-density array. In the present study, we developed a focused oligonucleotide (or cDNA) array for use with patient peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). For this, we selected the genes that are predominantly expressed in normal PBMCs, as determined by stepwise subtractive hybridization4 and by genome-wide cDNA microarray analysis. From the 290 ‘PBMC-focused’ genes we identified, we can prepare the PBMC-focused cDNA array. We examined the expression levels of these PREP genes to analyze the PBMC RNAs obtained from patients suffering the autoimmune disease Churg–Strauss syndrome (CSS), which is an alternative name of allergic granulomatosis angiitis, because the autoimmune response of CSS patients is expected to disturb the expression levels of immune-related genes in PBMC. Indeed, we identified several genes whose expressions are markedly up- or down-regulated in all CSS patients tested. These observations suggest that this low-cost RNA diagnostics test is useful, practical, and can be used at the bedside.2. Patients, Materials and methods2.1. Human subjects: patients and healthy controlsBlood was obtained from eight healthy volunteers (four males and four females; aged 25–49 years) for the cDNA library preparation. Blood was also obtained from seven cases of CSS patients whose profiles are shown in Supplementary Table S1 and 18 healthy controls (six males and 11 females; aged 25–86 years) for focused microarray analysis. CSS patients were diagnosed according to the diagnostic criteria of the American College of Rheumatology.5 This study was reviewed and approved by the Internal Review Board of the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University. In accordance with the requirements of the Board, a written informed consent was obtained from each participant before venous blood samples were obtained. Serum samples were consecutively obtained regardless of the patient's symptom, active, or inactive phase.2.2. Preparation of RNAThe RNA of the PBMCs obtained from healthy volunteers was prepared as described previously.6 Briefly, heparinized venous blood (10 mL) was mixed with an equal volume of 2% dextran/saline solution and incubated at room temperature for 30 min to precipitate the red blood cells. Total RNA was extracted from the PBMC pellet by adding guanidine–thiocyanate solution and the samples were used for cDNA library preparation and subtractive hybridization.7 Total RNA was also prepared by acid guanidinium–phenol–chloroform extraction for the DNA microarray, northern blot, and RT–PCR analyses. In some experiments, total RNA was synthesized using Ribo Max kit (Promega, Madison, WI) from the PBMC cDNA library. Total RNA or mRNA from human fibroblast TIG-1 cells was prepared as described previously.7 ExTaq DNA polymerase for RT–PCR was purchased from TaKaRa Co. Ltd. (Otsu, Japan). Probe labeling and detection for northern blots were performed by using the Gene Images Random-Prime Labelling and Detection System (GE Healthcare Bio-Sciences Corp., Piscataway, NJ).2.3. Preparation of the subtracted cDNA library and stepwise subtractionPoly(A)+ RNA was purified from total RNA by oligo(dT) cellulose chromatography. A cDNA library with eight million independent clones was constructed from the PBMC mRNAs by using the linker-primer method and the pAP3neo vector as described previously.7 The poly(A)+ RNAs from exponentially growing TIG-1 cells that had been incubated with 10% serum in tissue culture plates were also purified and biotinylated by using photobiotin. After converting the cDNA library to a single-stranded form by transfection with an f1 helper phage, we hybridized it with the biotinylated mRNAs and subtracted it by biotin–avidin interactions.7 The unhybridized clones were converted to the double-stranded form and used to transform competent Escherichia coli cells. This generated a first-stage subtracted cDNA library of 11 million independent clones.We then prepared plasmid DNA from ∼800 randomly selected cDNA clones and numbered and digested an aliquot of each plasmid DNA with SmaI and NotI restriction enzymes to prepare 10 sheets of Southern blots, each of which included 80 clones arranged in order. We then purified the cDNA inserts of clones 1–20 on 1% agarose gels by digesting them with EcoRI and NotI; these inserts were labeled with fluorescent dye and then used as probes for northern analysis with PBMC and TIG-1 RNAs to determine which clones contained PREP genes (data not shown). The DNA sequences of the PREP clones from the 5′ end of the cDNA inserts were determined by the dideoxy-chain termination reaction using an automatic DNA sequencer (Licor 4000L; Lincoln, NE). After these analyses, we selected the next 20 unhybridized clones on the Southern blot (from 21 onwards) for the next round of cDNA insert preparation, fluorescent labeling, and northern analysis. This procedure was repeated until we finished testing all 800 unhybridized clones. The PREP genes identified in the preceding step were then converted to RNA, biotinylated with photobiotin, and used to subtract the first-stage subtracted cDNA library. The second-stage subtracted cDNA library was then analyzed as described above and subtracted again. This process was repeated three times as described previously.4After the clones whose transcription was conspicuously up-regulated in PBMCs as compared with TIG-1 cells were sequenced, the DNA sequences were used to search the EST database by using the BLAST algorithm (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/).2.4. Human cDNA microarray analysis for identification of PREP genesThe total RNAs (500 ng) from the normal human PBMCs were pooled, as were the TIG-1 cell RNAs, after which both pools were reverse-transcribed by using oligo-dT primers containing the T7 RNA polymerase promoter sequence. The cDNAs were then subjected to in vitro transcription using T7 RNA polymerase to label the complementary RNAs (cRNAs) with cyanine 3 (Cy3)-CTP or cyanine 5 (Cy5)-CTP (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway, NJ). The Cy-labeled cRNAs from the normal human PBMCs (1 µg) were then mixed with the same amount of reverse color Cy-labeled TIG-1 cell-derived cRNAs. Hybridizations, rinsing, scanning, and gene analysis on the Agilent's all human cDNA microarray (Hu44K) were conducted according to the manufacturer's protocol (G2940BA; Agilent Technologies, Inc., Palo Alto, CA). Fluorophore reversal (dye swap) duplicates were used in two-color DNA microarray experiments. The 399 genes that showed the highest level of up- or down-regulation were selected and subjected to RT–PCR analysis using the normal human PBMC and TIG-1 RNAs (Fig. 1) with relevant oligonucleotide primers (Supplementary Table S2). Of these, 122 genes were identified as PREP genes, 33 of which were already identified as PREP genes by stepwise subtraction.4Identification of PREP genes. Individual PREP cDNA clones were subjected to northern blot or RT–PCR analysis to compare their gene expression levels in the PBMCs of healthy volunteers (right lanes, denoted as P) and human fibroblast TIG-1 cells (left lanes, denoted as T). The names of the PREP genes are shown in Table 1. The RT–PCR data for GAPDH and the northern blot data for β-actin are also shown as loading controls. The annealing temperature and amplification cycles used in the RT–PCRs are denoted to the left of each image by a–h: a, 50°C and 35 cycles, b, 50°C and 30 cycles, c, 55°C and 35 cycles, d, 55°C and 40 cycles, e, 55°C and 45 cycles, f, 55°C and 30 cycles, and g, 50°C and 40 cycles, respectively. The northern blots are denoted as n.Identification of PREP genes.

The northern blots are denoted as n.2.5. Individual microarray analysis on CSS patientsThe quality of the RNA samples obtained from PBMCs of each CSS patient was examined by using the RNA 6000 Nano LabChip Kit (p/n 5065-4476) on the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer. To conduct the individual cDNA microarray (Hu44K) analysis on CSS patients and normal volunteers, we generated fluorescently labeled cRNA by in vitro transcription with T7 RNA polymerase in the presence of Cy5-CTP or Cy3-CTP using a Low RNA Input Fluorescent Linear Amplification Kit (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) as described above. The Cy5-labled cRNA of each patient was then mixed with the Cy3-labled cRNA of normal volunteers to probe the cDNA microarray. PREP gene expression analysis was then conducted by using the Gene Spring software 7.3.1 (Agilent Technologies, Inc.) by setting appropriate parameters to select 33 or 3 PREP genes whose expressions are up-regulated (>1.2-fold change) or down-regulated (<1.0-fold change) in all seven CSS patients as compared with healthy volunteers. We also conducted similar analysis to select nine conspicuously up-regulated PREP genes (>2.0-fold change).3. Results3.1. Isolation of putative PBMC-specific genesTo isolate putative human PBMC-specific genes, we first prepared mRNAs from the PBMCs of healthy volunteers and generated a human PBMC cDNA library with 80 million independent clones by using the linker-primer method described previously.7 We also prepared mRNAs from exponentially growing normal human fibroblast TIG-1 cells, which are control cells that express non-PBMC transcripts. These mRNAs were biotinylated with photobiotin7 and used to subtract the PBMC cDNA library as described previously4 to remove the housekeeping and non-PBMC-specific genes. Briefly, after converting the PBMC cDNA library to a single-stranded form by transfection with f1 helper phage, we hybridized it with the biotinylated TIG-1 mRNAs and subtracted it by biotin–avidin interactions. The unhybridized clones were converted to the double-stranded form, which was then used to transform competent E. coli cells, thereby generating a subtracted cDNA library.To analyze this subtracted cDNA library, we prepared plasmid DNA from several hundred randomly selected and numbered cDNA clones. An aliquot of each plasmid DNA was then digested with EcoRI and NotI and their cDNA inserts were purified on 1% agarose gels and fluorescently labeled. These probes were then used in northern analysis to identify those genes whose transcript levels were much higher in PBMCs than in TIG-1 cells, namely, those genes that showed almost a plus/minus type difference. These genes were named PREP after predominantly expressed in PBMC. As shown in Fig. 1, each northern sheet only included two lanes, one each for the RNAs extracted from PBMCs and TIG-1. The DNA sequences of these candidate PREP genes were determined from the 5′ end of the cDNA inserts by the dideoxy-chain termination reaction and were used to search the EST database by employing the BLAST algorithm (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). For those candidate PREP genes whose northern blot signals were weak or undetectable, we examined whether these candidate genes were indeed up-regulated by RT–PCR using oligonucleotide primers based on the DNA sequences of these genes (Supplementary Table S2) (Fig. 1). These procedures were repeated until almost all subtracted cDNAs were tested, as described previously.4 The end result was the isolation of 197 PREP genes.To reduce the possibility of missing important PBMC-specific pathogenic genes by the stepwise subtraction method, we also performed in parallel a genome-wide cDNA microarray analysis by using Agilent's Hu44K array with the same pooled RNA samples obtained from the PBMCs and TIG-1. The 399 genes that showed the greatest up-regulation in PBMCs compared with TIG-1 were then tested by RT–PCR. This resulted in the identification of 126 PREP genes, 33 of which were the same as those obtained by the stepwise subtraction analysis. The candidate PREP genes were tested by northern and/or RT–PCR analyses to confirm their PBMC-specifc expression (Fig. 1). We did not test those genes that showed lower up-regulation in PBMCs than the 399 genes because the efficiency of detecting a PREP was conspicuously lower in the top 151–400 microarray genes than in the top 1–150 genes. Thus, it appears that while the stepwise subtraction method failed to identify 93 PREP genes, the DNA microarray analysis failed to detect 164 PREP genes. This disparity is mainly due to the differently sized drivers or probes used for hybridization; cDNA subtraction uses kilobase-order biotinylated mRNA as the driver for subtraction, while DNA microarrays are probed by 60-base oligonucleotides. These data together indicate that we identified 290 PREP genes (Supplementary Table S3).3.2. Characterization of the unknown PREP genesOf the 290 PREP genes that we identified, PREP1–PREP50 are uncharacterized genes. Homology and motif search of the gene products (Prep1–Prep50 proteins) using the Motif Scan algorithm (http://myhits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-bin/motif_scan) revealed the following notable motifs in PREP1–PREP11 (Fig. 2), which may suggest their putative physiological functions. The other uncharacterized PREP genes did not have any notable motifs.Schematic depiction of the uncharacterized gene products Prep1-Prep11. Numbers indicate the amino acids of the protein. RRM, RNA recognition motif; GEF, Guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PH, pleckstrin homology; LisH, LIS1 (lissencephaly) homology; bZIP, basic region/leucine zipper; Sir2, sirtuin 2; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide.Schematic depiction of the uncharacterized gene products Prep1-Prep11. Numbers indicate the amino acids of the protein. RRM, RNA recognition motif; GEF, Guanine nucleotide exchange factor; PH, pleckstrin homology; LisH, LIS1 (lissencephaly) homology; bZIP, basic region/leucine zipper; Sir2, sirtuin 2; FAD, flavin adenine dinucleotide.PREP1 encodes an RNA-binding protein because it harbors three RNA recognition motifs.8PREP2 encodes a protein that harbors a V-set Ig-like domain that is responsible for binding to sialic acid.9 A specialized subgroup of the Ig superfamily, called sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs), can recognize sialylated glycoconjugates and play a role in cell–cell recognition and intracellular signaling. At least 11 related genes have been identified in the human genome, all of which encode type 1 membrane proteins that carry an N-terminal sialic acid-binding V-set Ig domain and varying numbers of C2-set Ig domains.9 Thus, Prep2 may be a Siglec-type protein. Prep3 protein belongs to the large calcineurin-like phosphoesterase superfamily. Members of this superfamily include the polymerase-associated B-subunits and all carry an active site harboring two divalent metal ions for catalysis.10 This suggests that Prep3 protein may participate in cell growth by regulating DNA replication. PREP4 encodes a novel member of the paxillin family proteins that bear the RhoGEF and PH domains.11 Paxillin is a multi-domain adaptor that recruits associated proteins to focal adhesions, where it plays a pivotal role in transducing cell signaling, thereby eliciting changes in cell migration and gene expression.12 Given that the RhoGEF and PH domains both are also found in these cell signaling molecules, Prep4 protein appears to function in the signal transduction of growth signals. PREP5 encodes a protein with a LisH (LIS1 homology) motif, which is found in many signaling proteins of the WD-40 family and is believed to help regulate microtubule dynamics by mediating dimerization or binding to cytoplasmic dynein heavy chain.13 Prep6 protein is homologous to laminin A, which is one of the 15 laminin isoforms that are the major component of basement membranes.14PREP7 encodes a basic-leucine zipper (bZip) transcription factor15 with a DNA-binding motif called AT-hook.16PREP8 encodes a protein that is weakly homologous to Sir2, an NAD-dependent deacetylase that links metabolism with longevity in yeast, flies, and worms.17 Prep9 protein harbors a region that is weakly homologous to extensin, a hydroxyproline-rich cell wall structural glycoprotein of higher plants.18 The N-terminal region of Prep10 protein bears a domain that has homology to the adenovirus hexon-associated protein IX.19 Prep11 protein carries in its C-terminus a domain with homology to the flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-binding domain of siderophore-interacting protein which may be involved in iron chelation and iron utilization.203.3. Expression pattern of PREP1–PREP11 and proto-oncogene PREP genes in PBMCsTo determine whether the uncharacterized PREP1–PREP11 genes are expressed in particular human blood cells, we performed RT–PCR on multiple tissue cDNA (MTC) panels from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA). As shown in Fig. 3, PREP3, PREP4, and PREP6 mRNAs were only detected in resting CD14+ cells (monocytes; M), whereas PREP1 mRNAs were predominantly found in monocytes but were also faintly expressed in resting CD19+ cells (B cells). In addition, PREP11 showed a strong signal in monocytes and B cells and a weak signal in T-suppressor/cytotoxic cells and activated CD4+ T cells. PREP2 was strongly detected in monocytes, T-helper/inducer, and B cells, and weakly in T-suppressor/cytotoxic and activated CD4+ cells. PREP7 was strongly expressed in all mononuclear cells (B cells, T cells, and monocytes), weakly expressed in activated CD8+ T cells, and faintly expressed in activated CD4 + , CD19 + , and mononuclear cells. PREP10 was detected strongly in all resting mononuclear cells, but only faintly in the other cell types examined. The other PREP genes were ubiquitously expressed at almost equal levels in all cell types examined and indeed could serve as a loading control like GAPDH.Determination by RT–PCR of the human blood cells that express PREP1–PREP11. RT–PCR was performed using a multiple tissue cDNA panel for human blood fractions (MTC, Clontech). GAPDH was also amplified as a loading control.

We initially asked whether the augmented expression of these proto-oncogenes is due to infection-induced T-cell or macrophage stimulation in one of the PBMC donors. To test this, we examined the expression of these proto-oncogenes by RT–PCR on the MTC panel described above, since the sample RNAs used to generate the panel is not the same as our RNAs (Fig. 4). To our surprise, we found all cell types examined strongly expressed c-ets, c-src, and c-yes. All mononuclear cells (B cells, T cells, and monocytes) and activated CD4+ and CD19+ cells, but not activated CD8+ and mononuclear cells, also expressed c-vav. In contrast, c-fgr was only detected in T-suppressor/cytotoxic cells, while c-fos was only detected in resting T-suppressor/cytotoxic cells, B cells, and mononuclear cells. Thus, the expression of these proto-oncogenes is a commonly observed phenomenon.Expression profiles of the indicated proto-oncogenes in human blood fractions.

Focused PREP analysis of CSS PBMCsWe next examined whether the PREP genes can serve in a focused array that can be used to diagnostically. For this purpose, we used the array to determine if CSS patients can be characterized by a particular PREP mRNA expression pattern. CSS is a rare autoimmune disease (ca. 2.4 per million), namely, a small-vessel necrotizing vasculitis that is typically characterized by asthma, lung infiltrates, extravascular necrotizing granulomas, and hypereosinophilia.21 This disease was chosen because diagnostic gene markers for this disease have not yet been reported. Moreover, it is likely that the symptoms of CSS patients will be reflected in abnormal gene expressions in their PBMCs. Indeed, we found with the aid of expression profiling analysis (GeneSpring) that, compared with normal volunteers, 33 PREP genes are consistently up-regulated in the PBMCs of all seven cases of CSS patients tested (Fig. 5A, uppermost panel). Of these, PREP135, PREP77, PREP191, PREP234, and PREP136, which are highlighted by larger arrows in Fig. 5A, showed the most conspicuous up-regulation in all CSS patients (>2.5-fold change).Expression profiles of PREP genes in CSS patient PBMCs. Agilent's whole human genome DNA microarray was employed for this analysis. (A) Presentation of mosaic tiles for the 33 and 3 PREP genes whose expressions are up-regulated (>1.2-fold change) or down-regulated (<1.0-fold change) in all seven CSS patients as compared with healthy volunteers. The gene names are indicated on the right of the panels. The PREP genes were selected by a filter and their expressions in all seven cases of CSS patients were grouped together by using GeneSpring software 7.3 (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). In other words, their raw expression values were normalized according to the manufacturer's instructions by conducting a ratio calculation of the two channels.

(A) Presentation of mosaic tiles for the 33 and 3 PREP genes whose expressions are up-regulated (>1.2-fold change) or down-regulated (<1.0-fold change) in all seven CSS patients as compared with healthy volunteers. The gene names are indicated on the right of the panels. The PREP genes were selected by a filter and their expressions in all seven cases of CSS patients were grouped together by using GeneSpring software 7.3 (Agilent Technologies, Inc.). In other words, their raw expression values were normalized according to the manufacturer's instructions by conducting a ratio calculation of the two channels. This was followed by a per-gene normalization to ensure all ratios for each gene were normalized to 1.

The ordinate scale indicates relative log ratio values.PREP135 encodes the coactosin-like protein (CLP), which is a small, evolutionarily conserved F-actin-binding protein that can also bind to 5-lipoxygenase (5LO) and regulate its activity.22PREP77 encodes prosaposin, the precursor of the sphingolipid activator proteins (saposin A, B, C, and D) that are required for the enzymatic hydrolysis of sphingolipids by specific lysosomal hydrolases.23PREP191, which encodes a lysosomal aspartyl peptidase cathepsin D (CTSD), is known to be involved in prosaposin proteolysis.24 Thus, the enhanced expression of PREP77 and PREP191 suggests sphingolipid levels are increased in CSS. This is consistent with the pivotal role sphingolipids are known to play as proinflammatory factors.25 Thus, sphingolipids and related enzymes may not only be diagnostic marker for CSS, they may also be novel therapeutic targets in CSS (see Discussion).PREP234 encodes Gardner–Rasheed feline sarcoma viral (v-fgr) oncogene homolog (c-fgr: FGR), which is known to play an important role in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced macrophage activation.26 Indeed, Fgr-deficient mice fail to develop lung eosinophilia in response to repeated challenge with aerosolized ovalbumin (OVA)27. Src-family tyrosine kinases are required to support the accumulation of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMN) along with adherent platelets at the site of vascular injury.28PREP136 encodes lysozyme, which is one of the genes responsible for autosomal dominant hereditary amyloidosis.29 Indeed, there are several case reports of amyloidosis associated with CSS that occurs together with a destructive inflammatory or granulomatous reaction to amyloid.30 Several case reports have also described granulomatous angiitis in patients with sporadic, amyloid beta peptide (Abeta)-related cerebral amyloid angiopathy and Abeta-related angiitis with development of amyloid-associated inflammation.31There are also four other less conspicuously CSS-up-regulated PREP genes (2.0–2.5-fold change). Of these, PREP226 encodes a receptor (membrane)-type variant of the protein tyrosine phosphatase (PTPepsilonM) family protein that negatively regulates insulin receptor (IR) signaling by dephosphorylating IR, thereby suppressing the phosphorylation of IR downstream enzymes such as Akt, extracellular regulated kinase (ERK), and glycogen synthase kinase 3 (GSK3).32 Notably, the cytosolic isoform of PTPepsilon (PTPepsilonC) selectively inhibits interleukin-6 (IL-6)- and IL-10-induced Janus kinases (JAK)-signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) signaling in blood cells.33Another of the four less conspicuously up-regulated PREP genes, PREP113, encodes platelet factor 4 (PF4; CXC chemokine ligand 4), which is a specific marker for megakaryocyte cells and that induces the differentiation of monocytes into macrophages during the inflammatory process.34PREP286 encodes lysosomal-associated multi-spanning membrane protein-5 (LAPTM5). While the function of LAPTM5 is unknown, it may participate in host defense in collaboration with other lysosome-related genes (PREP77, PREP191, and PREP136) in the blood cells of CSS patients. These results suggest that the regulation of cell signaling in blood cells from CSS patients is abnormal. The last of the four less conspicuously up-regulated PREP genes is PREP203, which encodes the spliceosomal protein thioredoxin-like 4B (TXNL4B). However, its physiological significance in the pathogenesis of CSS remains unclear.We also identified three PREP genes that, compared with normal volunteers, are down-regulated in the PBMCs of all seven CSS patients (Fig. 5A, middle panel). PREP76 encodes nicastrin;35 its down-regulation may disturb the phagocytic response of macrophages to inflammatory cytokines since gamma-secretase catalyzes the intramembrane cleavage of its protein substrates and targets phagocytosis-related proteins of macrophages.36PREP114 encodes selectin P ligand (SELPLG), which stimulates T lymphocytes, and plays a critical role in the tethering of these cells to activated platelets or endothelia expressing P-selectin.37PREP283 encodes sperm-associated antigen 9 (SPAG9), which has also been identified as a serum target of the autoantibody produced in systemic sclerosis (SSc).38 Thus, the reduced expression of these three genes could also serve as diagnostic markers of CSS. Unfortunately, we could not correlate the expression levels of these genes to the profiles of tested CSS patients (Supplementary Table S1).3.5. Expression pattern of CSS-up-regulated PREP genes in PBMCsTo examine whether these 12 CSS-up- or -down-regulated PREP genes are expressed in particular human blood cells, we performed RT–PCR on MTC panels (Fig. 6). PREP76, PREP135, and PREP203 were expressed by nearly all cells, and were the only genes that were expressed by activated CD19+ and activated CD8+ cells. Most of the 12 PREP genes were expressed by resting CD14+ cells (monocyte; M) and T-helper/inducer (T-h/i) cells, albeit with different expression levels. All genes except PREP283 were expressed by T-suppressor/cytotoxic (T-s/c) cells. PREP76, PREP113, PREP114, PREP135, and PREP203 were expressed at varying expression levels by activated mononuclear cells (aMNC). All genes except PREP114, PREP135, and PREP283 were expressed by B cells, albeit comparatively weakly. Thus, many of the CSS-up-regulated or -down-regulated PREP genes are expressed by T cells or monocytes. Unfortunately, we could not perform the same analysis on CSS patients because of the low numbers of PBMCs available.Expression of CSS-up-regulated or -down-regulated PREP genes by various human blood cells. RT–PCR was performed with the MTC. The GAPDH expression profile served as a loading control. All PCR amplifications involved 35 cycles at 55°C.

Isolation of genes that are predominantly expressed in human PBMCsHere we show for the first time (to our knowledge) that RNA diagnostics can be performed by using a PBMC-specific focused array. Such RNA diagnostics methods have the advantage over DNA diagnostics in that ethical problems concerning the genetic information of individuals are avoided. To select the PBMC-specific genes for use in RNA diagnostics, we utilized a technique that we developed previously, namely, stepwise subtraction.4 In this technique, all genes expressed by a particular cell, tissue, or whole organism are used to generate a cDNA library. This library is then systematically subtracted in a stepwise manner by using the biotinylated mRNAs from a control population to isolate essentially all those genes that are up-regulated relative to the control population expression profile. This technique has proven to be useful for isolating the protein-coding genes that are specifically expressed during cancer metastasis, meiosis, and spermatogenesis, and in patients with autoimmune diseases.4,39–41 It has also been used to identify putative non-coding RNAs that cannot be identified by microarray screening.42 By using this technique along with high-density oligonucleotide microarray analysis, we identified 290 PREP genes that are predominantly expressed in human PBMCs as compared with fibroblast (TIG-1) cells (Fig. 1 and Table 1). These genes could be used to generate a PBMC-specific focused array that could be used to characterize the abnormal expression profiles in the PBMCs of patients with a particular disease. The abnormal profiles could then serve as a diagnostic tool for other patients presenting with this disease.The 290 PREP genes we identified include 50 uncharacterized genes, 11 of which possess notable amino acid motifs (Fig. 2). Two of these, PREP1 and PREP6, were almost exclusively expressed in monocytes (Fig. 6). Of the 240 PREP genes that have been characterized previously, 11, eight, eight, seven, six, five, five, nine, and 36 are HLA genes, CD antigen genes, ribosomal protein genes, interferon (IFN)-related genes, S100 calcium-binding protein-related genes, interleukin (IL)-related genes, platelet-related genes, signal transduction-related genes, and immunity-related genes, respectively (Supplementary Table S4). We did not identify any other immunity-related genes as PREP genes by these techniques, probably because their expression levels are lower than the PREP genes.4.2. PBMC-specific array analysis with CSS patientsTo explore the usefulness of the PBMC-specific focused array analysis in RNA diagnostics, we tested the PBMCs of seven cases of CSS patients.21 The precise pathogenetic mechanisms of CSS remain elusive, in part because the rarity of this disease. We found that compared with normal volunteers, 22 PREP genes were up-regulated by >1.5-fold in the PBMCs of all seven CSS patients (Fig. 5). Of these, PREP135, PREP77, PREP191, PREP234, PREP136, PREP203, and PREP113 were the most conspicuously up-regulated in CSS patients. How these genes contribute to the pathogenesis of CSS is suggested by the known functions of their products, as follows. PREP77 (prosaposin) and PREP135 (CLP) may indicate the enhanced immune responses that cause vascular inflammation; PREP203 (TXNL4B) and PREP234 (c-fgr) may reflect the augmented intracellular signaling that occurs after an infection causes inflammation; and the increased expression of the lysosome-related genes PREP77, PREP136, PREP191, and PREP286 may indicate the mounting of an effective defense against invading microorganisms by the lysosomes in blood cells. Thus, our PREP gene-focused analysis of CSS patients has helped to identify genes that may be putative diagnostic and/or therapeutic targets.There are few molecular tools that can be used to aid the diagnosis of CSS. The main tool that is commonly employed is the detection of antineutrophil cytoplasmic autoantibodies (ANCA), which can be detected by an immunofluorescent assay (IFA) on ethanol-fixed neutrophils. ANCA are associated with systemic necrotizing vasculitis and glomerulonephritis diseases such as CSS, Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), and microscopic polyarteritis (MPA).43 Two different ANCA immunostaining patterns are observed, namely, a diffuse cytoplasmic staining pattern (c-ANCA) that recognizes proteinase 3, and a perinuclear/nuclear pattern (p-ANCA) that commonly recognizes myeloperoxidase (MPO), which is a neutrophil granule protein that helps generate oxygen radicals and is associated with the antimicrobial properties of neutrophils. The c-ANCA pattern is most frequently observed in WG patients, whereas the p-ANCA pattern is detected in CSS and MPA patients.44 Notably, ANCAs against alternative antigens such as cathepsin G, which is a major protease released by activated neutrophils, are also occasionally observed.Since antibodies against cathepsin D (PREP191), PTPRE (PREP226), FGR (PREP234), PF4 (PREP113), CLP (PREP135), and prosaposin (PREP77) are currently commercially available, it may be worthwhile to use these antibodies in IFAs on ethanol-fixed blood cell samples to determine whether these antibodies have a relationship with the ANCA-staining patterns in CSS and whether they can help confirm the diagnosis in ANCA-negative CSS patients. Unfortunately, these experiments will have to be performed in the future because the CSS blood samples we obtained were used up during RNA preparation. Moreover, as CSS occurs only very rarely (only 2.4 patients per 1 million people in Japan), it will take some time to accumulate enough patients for such a study.FundingThis work was supported in part by grants-in-aid from Bio-Medical Cluster Project In Saito, Innovation Plaza Osaka of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST), Scientific Research on Priority Areas ‘Applied Genomics’, Scientific Research (S), Exploratory Research, and the Science and Technology Incubation Program in Advanced Regions, from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan to H.N.

IntroductionIn 2002, Mammalian Gene Collection (MGC) sequenced and verified over 9000 human full-ORF genes and 7800 candidate full-ORF genes.1 One year after, full-length Japan Program (FLJ) reported 21 243 cDNAs, of which 14 409 (10 897 clusters) were unique ones and half of them (5416) seemed to be protein-coding.2 Ten months later, International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium announced on Nature that the euchromatic sequence of the human genome has been finished.3 The current genome sequence (Build 35) contains 2.85 billion nucleotides interrupted by only 341 gaps. It covers 99% of the euchromatic genome and is accurate to an error rate of 1 event per 100 000 bases. It seems to encode only 20 000–25 000 protein-coding genes.3 These advances should serve as a firm foundation for biomedical research in the decades ahead. Next step, people will be interested in profiling the temporal and special gene expression patterns in the individual human organs or cells on a genome-wide scale and comparing with some normal physiological processes and diseases status as well. However, we noticed that although MGC constructed >100 cDNA libraries, derived from a wide variety of tissues and cell lines (complete list at http://mgc.nci.nih.gov), and FLJ constructed 107 human cDNA libraries enriched for full-length cDNA clones, representing 61 tissues, 21 primary cell cultures, and 16 cell lines used to select the putative full-ORF clones, one reproductive organ, epididymis, which is beside the testis, connecting it with the vas deferens, has been neglected by both of the above groups. Mammalian spermatogonia undergo mitosis, meiosis, and some morphological changes to become a fully differentiated sperm in testis. But they are not mature, they pass through the epididymis, a convoluted duct, bathe in the duct lumen, and interact with some proteins in these particular microenvironments so that they acquire forward motility and fertility potential and become a so-called matured sperm stored in the end of this duct waiting for ejaculation. It was also reported that a great number of genes exclusively expressed in this organ. Besides, the epididymal epithelial cells in different regions of the duct, namely caput (the head part), corpus (the middle part), and cauda (the tail part), expressed different proteins secreted into the lumen and created an ever-changed microenvironment. For example, sperm gain their forward motility just in the caput region. Recently, the mouse epididymis has been divided into 10 segments anatomically by lobules bounded by connective tissue septa.4 Analysis of differentially regulated genes in the mouse epididymis by DNA array demonstrates that more than 2168 genes, ∼13% of the genes expressed in the epididymis, differ in their level of expression in different segments by at least fourfold. The large number of regulated genes within a grossly dissected single organ is unprecedented. In comparison, only 1186 genes are differentially regulated (fourfold, P = 0.01) between the kidney and the liver, two distinct organs with very different functions. This suggests that sperm maturation, transport, and storage in the epididymis are highly complex events. The more and more people pay attentions to this organ. Because understanding the molecular mechanisms of sperm maturation in epididymis will be of great helps not only in answering how the expression of region-specific programmatically expressed genes was controlled but also in male contraceptive drug design, personalized diagnosis, and treatment of infertility and sperm health evaluation. To this end, human genome U133 plus 2.0 microarray covered over 47 000 transcripts and variants representing 38 500 well-characterized human genes were applied by our lab to obtain a full profile of gene expression in the epididymis of a fertile young male.5 Genes expressed exclusively or predominantly within one region could be searched from this data resources on the website http://www.scbit.org/human_epididymis_transcriptomes) conveniently. However, those unknown epididymis-specific genes were still absent on the DNA chip. All of these urged us to complete this defect. Here, we partially sequenced a cDNA library for an adult human epididymis. We want to provide the following informations: (i) a list of the cDNAs expressed in the adult human epididymis; (ii) among them, which genes have been reported, which genes are just a known sequence but without any characterization data, and which genes are totally novel; (iii) are the novel ones human epididymis-specific and even region-specific in human epididymis? The data are not only useful for the epididymis community but also good for addendum the human transcriptome.2. Materials and methods2.1. Construction of cDNA libraryHuman epididymis was obtained from male of age 28 with one-child reproductive history and normal spermatogenesis without the other related diseases (the donor died of accident and were voluntary to donate), which was approved by the Ethics Committee of Shanghai Institutes for Biological Sciences, Chinese Academy of Sciences. Samples were sliced into 1 mm3 under low temperature, frozen by nitrogen, and stored at −70°C. Human epididymis total RNA was extracted by Trizol (Invitrogen). The quality was determined by electrophoresis on a 1.1% formaldehyde degenerated agarose gel.The cDNA library of human epididymis was constructed by Creator SMART cDNA Library Construction Kit (CLONTECH) according to the manufacturer's suggestions. Finally, the human epididymal cDNA was ligated into the vector pDNR-LIB and 5 µL of ligation product was transformed to 25 µL of electrocompetent cell XL1-Blue. The entire transformation mixture was transferred to the tubes containing 970 µL of LB broth. The method of consecutive dilution was used to titer the bacteria solution.6 After incubating with shaking (225 rpm) for 1 h at 37°C, 1 µL of each transformation mixture was added into the appropriate tube containing 1 mL of LB broth and then 1 µL of dilution was added into 1 mL of LB broth. Combine 1 µL of final dilution with 50 µL of LB broth and spread it onto LB/Cm plates. Inverted the plates and incubated at 37°C overnight. The number of colonies was counted to determine the titer (cfu/mL). Calculated the titer according to the following formulas: colony × 103 × 103 cfu/mL.2.2. Characterization of human epididymis cDNA libraryThe number of 150 mm plates was calculated based on the library titer. Library diluted by LB medium was spreaded onto LB/Cm plates which were inverted and incubated at 37°C overnight. Fourteen isolated colonies were picked and boiled as template for further PCR identification using M13 Sense and Antisense primer.Thousand isolated colonies from the human epididymis cDNA library were first picked and sequenced by 5′-end one-pass using ABI 3100 sequencing system for quality evaluation of this cDNA library. Further, total of 20 000 colonies were sequenced by 5′-end one way. Then the sequencing results were blasted with Nr and EST database published on March 2004. The non-public cDNAs were identified by bilateral sequencing. All the sequencing was subjected to bioinformatics analysis.Our sequencing results were compared with 11 monkey epididymis genes7 and six human epididymis specific expression genes HE1-HE68 using clustalw software. The unmatched genes are amplified by PCR using cDNA library as template. The primers used for identification of each unmatched genes can be seen in supplementary Table S1.2.3. Gene expression analysis using northern blot and RT–PCRSome selected clones were used as probes for further northern analysis. Northern blot analysis was performed according to the procedure described previously.9 The 10 µg total RNA of each sample was loaded in each lane. An 18S r-RNA hybridization signal was used as a loading control. Epididymis-specific expression of con16, 32, and 33 was further evaluated by RT–PCR using cDNA from caput, corpus, cauda epididymis, and other seven human tissues. The ESC42 and β-actin primers were applied as control.3. Results and discussions3.1. Evaluation of the human epididymis cDNA libraryThe quality of the total mRNAs prepared from an entire human epididymis was judged as A260/A280 = 1.85 and the 28S/18S = 2/1 shown in the Fig. 1A. The size of the resulted ds.cDNAs smeared from 4 kb to 200 bp on the agarose gel as shown in the Fig. 1B.Quality analysis of the human epididymal cDNA library.

Lane m, 1 kb DNA ladder; lane 1 ∼ 14, randomly-selected cDNA clones from the library were served as template for PCR amplification.Creator SMART cDNA Library Construction Kit (CLONTECH) was used to construct the library. It is the case that PCR employed in SMART kit can result in the clone frequencies bias. However, in this work, we have introduced the minimal PCR cycles (18 cycles) as recommended by the manufacturers which would reduce the bias significantly. The titer of this cDNA library is 2 × 107 cfu/mL. The 14 clones randomly selected from this library were examined to evaluate the quality of this library. Fig. 1C showed that 13 of 14 clones were positive. The distribution of the insert size was as follows: >1 kb for two clones, >700 bp for three clones, >500 bp for seven clones, and 400 bp for one clone. The quality of our library might be not very high because it contained a lot of relatively short inserts. However, it is true that the size of many epididymis-specific transcripts is quite small, less than 1 kb, such as at least 19 beta-defensins,10 7 lipocalins,11 HE1, HE4, and HE5.12It indicated that either the transformation efficiency (92.8%) or the insert length was high enough. For further testing the quality of the inserts, 1000 clones were sequenced at the 5′-teminal. The 450 bp sequencing data in average proved that 92.5% clones were positive. Among them, 92% of which could be found in the EST bank (December 2003) and only 8% could not. Seventy-five percentage of the insert sequence was protein coding, corresponding to 693 genes. To this end, we decided to sequence them all.3.2. Sequencing data for 20 000 clones and bioinformatics analysisAs we know, the appearing frequency of the clones with same insert in the library was determined by their expression levels and in a direct proportion manner. So the number of the clones was not equal to the number of genes. And the insert of the clones could not be entirely the full-length cDNA. Owing to the financial limitation, we could not sequence all the clones in the library. According to the transcriptomes data from the human epididymis by DNA array, 26 893 qualifiers as ‘present signal > 1’ and 15 946 qualifiers as ‘present signal > 50’ were found in the whole epididymis, accounting for ∼49 and 29% of the total on the array respectively were found in the whole epididymis. So, 49 and 29% of the gene number 25 000 which were announced by the International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium would be around 12 250 and 7250 respectively to be expressed in epididymis. The DNA array data also showed that the gene expression level in epididymis was not the same. The variations sometimes were very high. There were 0.4% genes with ‘present signal > 5000’, 6.8% genes with ‘present signal > 500’, 58.3% genes with ‘present signal > 50’. It indicated that 41.7% of them (with ‘present signal > 1’) expressed in a very low level might be neglected. Therefore, we chose those genes with ‘present signal > 50’ holding 29% of the whole gene number 25 000 which will be only ∼7250 genes expressed in human epididymis being sent for sequencing. Besides, both MGC and FLJ programs also sequenced 10 000 clones per each cDNA library only. So, we decided to sequence 20 000 clones. It might be enough to reveal those sequences for 29% of the total genes (∼7250 genes) expressed in this library. The route map for analyzing these sequencing data was summarized in Fig. 2.Schematic diagram of sequenced clones from human epididymal cDNA library.Schematic diagram of sequenced clones from human epididymal cDNA library.After removal of those recognizable contaminating sequences and the same sequence from different clones, the 5′-terminal one-pass sequences of the 20 000 clones were narrowed down to 7450. These sequences were blasted against NR and EST database published on the March 2003. Six thousand seven hundred and fifty cDNA sequences could be found and the rest 650 ones could not. After further analysis by using tblastx software against NR, EST database, GeneBank, and ProteinBank Swissprot, it was found that 5390 cDNAs had been reported with somewhat various biological functions using the software Genespring 7.0. Table 1 showed the classification of their functions and the numbers of genes belong to. Fig. 3 showed the chromosome localization of the 3394 cDNAs reported. Notably, quite low frequency appeared on chromosome 12 and Y for the epididymis transcripts. Although the rest 1360 cDNA sequences can be found on the database, they were only a predicted sequence resulted from bioinformatics. 650 ESTs could not be found in all the databases and they were submitted to GenBank (EH041735-EH041927, FE192591-FE193047). The frequency of each of 7450 clones appearing in the sequenced 20 000 clones was also evaluated. Most of the clones are low-copy clones with the frequency no >10 among 20 000 clones. The contents of medium-copy (frequency 11–100) and high copy (frequency >100) clones are only 1.7% among the 7400 non-redundant clones.Chromosome location of 3394 cDNA sequences of human epididymis.Chromosome location of 3394 cDNA sequences of human epididymis.The statistical table of 5390 human epididymis sequencesThe statistical table of 5390 human epididymis sequencesFor further understanding the nature of these so-called novel cDNA fragments, 106 of 650 clones were randomly selected for fully sequencing. The 106 sequences were submitted to GenBank (DV643899 ∼ DV643998, DQ822205, DQ823637, DQ823638, EF426753, EF426754, EF426755). After getting rid of the contaminations or some repeated ones and being pieced together as long as possible, 79 independent unknown sequences were identified by Blast searching against GenBank NR database. These sequences were further searched against human genome database. Fifteen of 79 were found with significant redundant sequence in human genome and seemingly non-coding-transcripts; 8 of 79 clones were surprisingly not found in human genome; 19 of them have already been released during the course of this project but their function is still totally unknown; 25 sequences seemed to be totally unknown and unique in human genome (Fig. 2).For further checking if these novel genes expressed in human epididymis, 6 of 25 novel clones were selected for northern blot analysis. Con16, 32, and 33 did express in human epididymis even in a region-specific manner and not in testis (Fig. 4A and Table 2). Con32 and 33 were abundant in corpus region and con16 was abundant in cauda epididymis. Their tissue specificity was further tested by RT–PCR (Fig. 5). Epididymis-specific gene ESC42 was used as positive control which has the highest expression in caput epididymis.7 Con32 and 33 were exclusively expressed in human epididymis and con16 was expressed in human epididymis except lung. These three sequences have been extended by electronic cloning (EST overlapping and extension) and 5′race and have been deposited in GenBank. Con16 belongs to the defensin family and con32 belongs to the colipase family. They might play the important roles in sperm maturation and innate immunity in male reproductive tract. Northern blot analysis was also applied for testing if 4 of 19 released but unknown sequences were present in human epididymis. Although all of them (Con8, 29, 79, 97) did express in human epididymis, it looked neither epididymis-specific nor region-specific (Fig. 4B and Table 2). Since the released sequences were found in the cDNA library from non-epididymis tissues, it is not surprised to find these four clones were not epididymis-specific and also expressed in testis. The information dealing with these clones are summarized in Table 2.Northern blot validation of the mRNAs in human epididymis using corresponding ESTs as probes. Ten microgram of total RNA extracted from human testis (T), epididymis (E), caput epididymis (Ca), corpus epididymis (Co), cauda epididymis (Cd) were loaded.

The sequences for the rest 202 clones were regarded as unknown ESTs and 193 of them were submitted to the EST database (EH041735-EH041927).3.2.3. Qualification of the libraryFifteen reported human epididymis-specific genes and eight monkey epididymis-specific genes newly discovered by our lab were checked in this cDNA library for qualifying its representative. It is happy to see that all the above cDNAs could be detected in this library shown in Table 3 and Fig. 6. However, only 69.6% of them could be found in our sequencing data. This means that sequencing 20 000 clones is not enough to cover all the expressing transcripts in this library. In another words, due to the financial limitation, at least one of three genes in this library had not been sequenced. Nevertheless, Table 3 showed that there is 87% of the 15 reported epididymis-specific genes could be found in our sequencing data, but only 37.5% for the eight newly discovered ones. Notably, it seems that those genes appearing in our sequencing data are basically with higher expression level. It makes sense, because as we mentioned above that the probability for the cDNA clone appearing in the library was determined by their expression levels and in a direct proportion manner. From this point of view, the sequencing data presented in this report might include the majority of the human epididymal transcriptome with relatively higher expression level. Further works based on the novel cDNAs resource will be good for revealing the whole transcriptome for an organ—human epididymis.PCR identification of previous identified human epididymis-specific clones which could not found in the 20 000 sequencing data with the human cDNA library as template.PCR identification of previous identified human epididymis-specific clones which could not found in the 20 000 sequencing data with the human cDNA library as template.Summary of epididymis-specific genes identified in the cDNA libraryThe bold letters indicate the eight novel genes.Summary of epididymis-specific genes identified in the cDNA libraryThe bold letters indicate the eight novel genes.In summary, the provided data possess the following significances.

IntroductionThe Human Genome Project disclosed sequence information on an entire set of elements that construct and regulate each human cell, tissue, and organ.1–3 Our next challenge is to decode the instructions encoded by three billion bases on the genome and to understand the molecular basis of human biology and pathology. In the last decade, post-sequencing projects have taken two approaches: (i) to collect an entire set of full-length transcripts (transcriptome) and in turn map them on the genome to identify their promoter region, and (ii) to compare the expression profiles of genes in different types of cells or tissues at different biological conditions. To achieve these purposes, many technologies have been developed: practical methods for synthesizing full-length cDNA,4–7 hybridization-based microarray,8,9 and tag-sequencing-based technologies10–14 for analyzing an expression profile.Large-scale analyses using these technologies have produced an enormous amount of data on human full-length transcripts,15–17 as well as on expression profiles,18–20 and have revealed the following facts. (i) Multiple transcripts of different sizes are generated from the same gene locus by alternative promoter usage,21 diverse transcriptional initiation,22 alternative splicing,23 and alternative polyadenylation.24 (ii) There are an unexpectedly large amount of sense–antisense pairs of transcripts.25,26 (iii) Many non-coding RNAs are transcribed.15,16 (iv) A considerable amount of transcripts estimated by expressed sequence tags (EST) of the UniGene database27 or by genome tiling array28,29 still remain to be annotated because of their low abundance.These data sets were accumulated using diverse cell types or tissues, because the first phase of the project was aimed at comprehensive gene collection. Hereafter, a second phase of investigation requires in-depth analysis of transcripts in a single type of cell population to elucidate the intracellular transcriptional regulatory network in a given cell. However, the full-length cDNA libraries constructed using the conventional methods do not meet the requirements for in-depth analyses because of the low complexity of the constituents. Furthermore, the presence of transcriptional variants raises a serious problem regarding the use of the conventional method for expression profiling of genes. If multiple variants transcribed from the same gene locus have a different function, we need to determine the expression profile of each variant to elucidate their role in the regulation network. However, the conventional methods that measure the amount of the limited region of each transcript by counting the number of sequence tags or by quantifying the hybridization signal cannot distinguish these variants without the precedent information of the full sequence of all variants expressed in a given cell.The two problems described above, the low complexity of the full-length cDNA library and the presence of multiple variants, can be solved by analyzing all variants that comprise a bias-free full-length cDNA library constructed from a single type of cell. Unfortunately, the conventional methods for synthesizing full-length cDNA were unsuitable for constructing a bias-free cDNA library that reflects an expression level of each transcript in the cell, because they have many processes during which the ratio of components may change. It is especially difficult to construct a bias-free library containing rare or long-sized full-length cDNA clones without changing their content.Recently, we have developed the vector-capping (V-capping) method for synthesizing full-length cDNA.30 This method is expected to be suitable to construct a bias-free cDNA library, because it consists of only three steps: the first-strand cDNA synthesis using a vector primer, self-ligation of the cDNA-vector construct, and the replacement of mRNA by the second-strand cDNA. The previous paper showed that we were able to construct the cDNA libraries containing full-length cDNA clones of >95% content without any selection procedure for full-length cDNAs. The further advantage of this library is that we can validate full-length cDNA by the presence of an additional G at its 5' end.In this paper, we performed in-depth analysis of the cDNA libraries constructed using the V-capping method from the total RNA isolated from human retinal pigment epithelial cell line ARPE-19, and demonstrated that the constructed library was useful as a starting resource not only for the comprehensive collection of full-length cDNA clones, but also for fine expression profile analysis of transcripts expressed in a single type of cell, including variants generated by alternative promoter usage, alternative transcriptional initiation, alternative splicing, and alternative polyadenylation.2. Materials and methods2.1. Cell culture and RNA preparationHuman retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) cell line ARPE-19 was obtained from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA). ARPE-19 cells were cultured in Dulbecco's modified eagle's medium: nutrient mixture F-12 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) containing 10% fetal bovine serum. The cells were incubated for 4 days to confluence in a humidified atmosphere of 5% CO2 and 95% air at 37°C. The cells were harvested by trypsinization. Total RNA was isolated using ISOGEN (NIPPON GENE, Tokyo, Japan).2.2. Vector primerA plasmid vector pGCAP10 was constructed by substituting the cloning site EcoRI–AflII–SwaI–KpnI of pGCAP130 with SwaI–EcoRI–FseI–EcoRV–KpnI. The nucleotide sequence of pGCAP10 is available from GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession no. AB371573. The plasmid pGCAP10 was digested with KpnI and tailed with ∼60 nucleotides of dT using terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (Takara Bio, Ohtsu, Shiga, Japan) according to the Okayama and Berg method.31 After digestion with EcoRV, the dT-tailed plasmid vector was purified on agarose gel and used as a vector primer. A cDNA insert can be cut out from the vector with two 8-nucleotide restriction enzymes, SwaI and NotI.2.3. cDNA synthesis with the V-capping methodTwo libraries, Lib-1 (ARe) and Lib-2 (ARi), were constructed using the V-capping method.30 Lib-1 has already been described in the previous paper.30 Lib-2 was different from Lib-1 in terms of the source of total RNA, a pGCAP10-derived vector primer, and a modified protocol. The experimental conditions were the same as described in the previous paper. A mixture of 5 µg of total RNA and 0.15 µg of pGCAP10-derived vector primer was incubated at 65°C for 5 min. The first-strand cDNA was synthesized using SuperScript IIITM reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen). The reaction mixture was incubated at 45°C for 3 h. After phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation, the pellet was dissolved in water. The next step in the original protocol is self-ligation with T4 RNA ligase (Takara Bio). The present protocol includes an EcoRI digestion step before self-ligation. The EcoRI digestion was performed in 200 µL of a reaction mixture containing 50 mM Tris–HCl (pH 7.5), 10 mM MgCl2, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 100 mM NaCl, and 0.2 U/μL of EcoRI (Takara Bio). The reaction mixture was incubated at 37°C for 1.5 h. After phenol/chloroform extraction followed by ethanol precipitation, the pellet was dissolved in water. Self-ligation and second-strand synthesis were performed in the same way as in the previous paper.302.4. Construction of cDNA libraryTransformation of Escherichia coli cells DH12S was performed using an electroporation method as previously described.30 Transformants were plated on LB agar without amplification. Colonies grown on the plates were picked manually or using a Flexys Colony Picker (Genomic Solutions, Ann Arbor, MI, USA) and suspended in 96-well or 384-well plates. After incubation and the addition of 50% glycerol, the original plates were stored at −80°C.2.5. Plasmid isolation and sequencingThe isolated plasmid DNA or DNA amplified using the illustra TempliPhiTM DNA amplification kit (GE Healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden) was used as a template for sequencing. DNA sequencing from the 5' end of the cDNA insert was carried out with a capillary DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA, USA) using a BigDyeTM Terminator Cycle sequencing FS Ready reaction kit. The full sequence of the cDNA insert was determined by a primer walking method.2.6. BLAST search and annotationFirst, the 5'-end sequences were used to query our custom database for human full-length cDNA clones (Homo-Protein cDNA bank)4 with a software GENETYXR-PDB (GENETYX Co., Tokyo, Japan). Most of the abundant genes, ribosomal RNAs, and mitochondria-derived sequences were identified by this search. Sequences not matching to entries in our custom database were used to query the NCBI Human Genome database (National Center for Biotechnology Information, Bethesda, MD, USA) with the BLAST algorithm.32 Each search was carried out manually, and the sequence alignment and map shown on the NCBI's Map Viewer were checked visually by us. Most sequences were mapped to the first exon of a known gene locus. If the query sequence was mapped to the upstream region of a known gene locus in the same direction, the sequence was assigned to that gene. Through the websites linked to the Map Viewer, including Entrez Gene33 and UniGene,27 we retrieved information on gene name, gene symbol, gene ID, chromosomal location, and RefSeq34 accession number. Sequences not mapped to the known gene locus were BLAST-searched against the NCBI database, including non-redundant nucleotide sequences and ESTs. EST sequences not included in Entrez Gene and the determined full sequences of long-sized cDNAs were deposited in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ under accession numbers AB371430–AB371572 and AB371574–AB371588, respectively.2.7. Estimation of the total number of genes composing librariesThe total number of genes constituting the library was estimated according to two approaches used for species richness estimation: non-sampling-based extrapolation and statistical sampling approaches.35 The former was performed by curve fitting to a gene-accumulation curve using asymptotic models, including negative exponential models and hyperbolic models.35 The curve fitting was carried out using software KaleidaGraph (Synergy Software, Reading, PA, USA). The latter approach used an abundance-based coverage estimator model ACE-1, a modified ACE for highly heterogeneous communities.36 The calculation was done using the SPADE (Species Prediction and Diversity Estimation) algorithm.372.8. Quantitative real-time PCRFirst-strand cDNA was synthesized with oligo(dT)30 as a primer from 20 µg of total RNA using SuperScript IIITM reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), and then purified by a Wizard PCR Preps DNA Purification System (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). Real-time PCR was performed using TaqMan Universal Master Mix (Applied Biosystems) on an ABI PRISM 7000 Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems) according to the manufacturer's instructions. One microlitter of diluted cDNA, equivalent to 300 ng of the initial total RNA template, was used in each reaction. Probes and primers designed by TaqMan Gene Expression Assays (Applied Biosystems) were used for the assays of ACTB (Hs99999903_m1), CFL1 (Hs00830568_g1), FLNA (Hs99999905_m1), FLNB (Hs00181698_m1), GAPDH (Hs99999905_m1), GUK1 (Hs00176133_m1), MYH9 (Hs00159522_m1), and RAI14 (Hs00210238_m1). The expression level was calculated based on a standard curve prepared for each gene using a plasmid with each cDNA as a template.3. Results3.1. cDNA LibraryTwo cDNA libraries, Lib-1 and Lib-2, were constructed using the V-capping method from the total RNA isolated from ARPE-19. The construction of Lib-1 and part of its analysis were described in a previous paper.30 A total of 10 176 clones from Lib-1 were randomly picked, cultured, and stored as a glycerol stock in 96-well plates. The clones were named ARe and ARf. Lib-2 was prepared from a different lot of total RNA using a slightly modified method that included an EcoRI digestion step after the first-strand cDNA synthesis. Transformation of the E. coli cells by cDNA vectors for Lib-2 was carried out in two batches at different times. The colonies picked from each batch were incubated and stored in 96-well plates (ARi, 6528 clones) and 384-well plates (ARiS, 76 800 clones), respectively. In this study, all of the ARe/ARf and ARi clones and part of ARiS (7296 clones) were analyzed by single-pass sequencing of the 5' end of cDNA.Table 1 shows the contents of each library classified by single-pass sequencing analysis. More than 90% clones provided the high-quality sequence data necessary for sequence analysis. The unreadable sequence may result from (i) deletion of a sequencing primer site on the vector, (ii) mixing of different clones, or (iii) failure of template DNA preparation. Many cases were attributed to the first reason because they showed no sequencing signals and could not be cut by restriction enzymes adjacent to the upstream of the cDNA insert. Each library contained insert-free vectors (3.3–3.9% in content), which may result from uncut vectors escaping from removal during the vector primer preparation process.Summary of single-pass sequencing analysis of librariesSummary of single-pass sequencing analysis of librariesLib-1 contained clones carrying a dT tail at the 5' end (1.9% in content). Inspection of the downstream sequence of these clones showed that they lacked a poly(A) tail and contained the inversely inserted cDNA whose 5' end was joined to the KpnI-cut end of the vector where the 3'-protruding bases were deleted. These clones may be generated by use of an aberrant vector primer that has a dT tail at the opposite end from the intended one, implying that the dT-tail addition to only one end of the vector plasmid occasionally occurred at the dT-tailing step with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase. Although the dT tail added to the opposite end should be removed by EcoRV digestion after the dT-tailing reaction, some must remain uncut. These clones starting with the dT tail could be removed by adding an EcoRI digestion step before self-ligation, as shown in the modified protocol. In fact, it worked so well that these artifacts drastically decreased to 0.16% in the ARi library and to 0.13% in the ARiS library.The same mechanism can also explain the addition of a vector-derived sequence, ATCCTG in the case of using pKA1U5 as a vector primer, adjacent to the 5' end of ∼5% of cDNA clones isolated from Lib-1. In this case, the opposite end might not have been dT-tailed and in addition might have escaped from EcoRV digestion. Although the EcoRI digestion step in the modified protocol was expected to remove this kind of additional sequence, 2.8% of clones in Lib-2 still had a residual sequence (CGGCCGGCCGAT) derived from the vector sequence located between the EcoRI and EcoRV sites because of incomplete digestion with EcoRI.3.2. Assessment of full-length cDNAThe 5'-terminal sequences of cDNA inserts were used for the database search. Clones having only poly(A) or the sequence of several bases with poly(A) were classified into a truncated cDNA, because these clones might be derived from degraded mRNA. The sequence similarity was searched against our custom human full-length cDNA database, the NCBI RefSeq database, and the human genome database using the BLAST algorithm. The libraries contained cDNA clones for mitochondria genome-derived transcripts (∼1% of cDNA-carrying clones) and rRNA (<0.06%). Except for mitochondrial clones, all sequences were able to map on the human genome.Most of the full-length cDNA clones identified as a known gene have a transcriptional start site (TSS) near to that of RefSeq. However, some sequences did not match the 5'-terminal sequence of RefSeq, presumably because our cDNA had a longer 5' UTR than RefSeq or was transcribed by the usage of an alternative promoter. These sequences were mapped on the human genome and the location of the sequence was determined. If the query sequence was located near the upstream region of the first exon of RefSeq or could be linked to the RefSeq via other mRNA or EST sequences that partly shared the query sequence, the clone was assigned to the gene for the corresponding RefSeq even though there was no shared sequence between the query and RefSeq.Consequently, 8275 clones from the ARe/ARf library, 5586 from ARi, and 6090 from ARiS were identified as a full-length cDNA. Most clones (93.6% for Lib-1, 92.3% for Lib-2) had an additional G or NG (N: T, TT, G, etc.) at their 5' end, which is a requisite for full-length cDNA starting from the cap site when using the V-capping method. The previous paper showed that some full-length cDNAs had no additional G.30 Thus, if the cDNA not having a 5'-end G started at the upstream region of the first exon of the known gene, it was admitted to be a full-length cDNA for the corresponding gene. Although some cDNAs contained a repetitive sequence such as an Alu repeat, they were also precisely mapped on the genome. Most of the truncated cDNAs existed as a short form with a poly(A) tail. Even such short cDNA was assigned to full-length when it was mapped to the region that was not a known gene locus and had an additional G at the 5' end. Consequently, the content of the full-length clone in all clones carrying a cDNA insert [including only a poly(A) insert] was calculated to be 95.5% for ARe/ARf, 95.2% for ARi, and 95.1% for ARiS.Out of 19 951 full-length cDNA clones, 1123 clones (5.6%) lacked an additional 5'-end G. These 5'-G-free genes were classified into two groups. One group (625 clones) consisted of clones starting with a nucleotide A. Another group (309 clones) was a 5'-terminal oligopyrimidine tract (5'-TOP) gene family that started with a pyrimidine-rich sequence, including predominantly ribosomal proteins. The genes that contained more than three 5'-G-free clones (G − ) with the same TSS were listed in Supplementary Table 1. It should be noted that G-added clones (G + ) corresponding to each G− clone were obtained except for NDUFB11. The content of G− clones was 0.04–0.31 for 16 kinds of 5'-TOP genes. On the other hand, the G− content for 12 out of 15 A-starting genes was 0.38–1.0, higher than for 5'-TOP genes. Although we could not find any conserved sequence in the 5' end of the G-free A-starting genes, the following finding suggests that the 5'-end sequence affected the addition or elimination of a cap structure. We obtained 82 clones starting with 5'-ACCACGCACG… for MT2A, out of which 44 had an additional G and 38 were G-free as shown in Supplementary Table 1. In addition, we obtained 43 clones starting with the fourth nucleotide A of the previous MT2A clone, i.e. 5'-ACGCACG…. Interestingly, all 43 clones had an additional G, suggesting that the presence of 5'-end three-nucleotide sequence resulted in the production of G-free clones.3.3. Gene annotationMapping a total of 19 951 full-length cDNA sequences to the genome revealed that they were classified into 4513 kinds of transcriptional units (i.e. genes), of which 4370 (96.8%) were included in Entrez Gene. All genes are listed in the order of GeneID in Supplementary Table 2. The list contains the symbol, GeneID, and name, which were retrieved from Entrez Gene, and in addition the accession number of the RefSeq, mRNA size, chromosomal location, and number of clones obtained from each library. Of 4370 genes, 4271 had an accession number with prefix “NM_” that indicates mRNA. The remaining 99 genes (2.3%) were possible non-coding genes.Long-sized full-length cDNA clones with >7 kb insertaThe frame shift owing to the insertion of one nucleotide A in the GOLGB1 clone was corrected.bRefSeq terminates with a short A-stretch in a 3'-untranslated region.cIn addition, 8 and 5 clones with >6 kb were obtained for COL4A1 and PLXNB2, respectively.Long-sized full-length cDNA clones with >7 kb insertaThe frame shift owing to the insertion of one nucleotide A in the GOLGB1 clone was corrected.bRefSeq terminates with a short A-stretch in a 3'-untranslated region.cIn addition, 8 and 5 clones with >6 kb were obtained for COL4A1 and PLXNB2, respectively.3.4. Expression profileFig. 1 shows the frequency distribution of abundant full-length genes obtained from three libraries. The most abundant genes were GAPDH and FTH1 (each 248 clones, 1.2% in content) followed by ACTB, ACTG1, EEF1A1, VIM, RPL41, MT2A, RPL1, CRYAB, TMSB10, RPS3, and RPL10, each of which gave ≥100 clones (0.5% in content). The number of abundant genes with ≥0.05% content (10 clones) was 310 (6.9% of identified genes). The major components were ribosomal proteins (79 kinds). Of the total genes, 2221 (49.2%) were obtained as a non-redundant transcript.Frequencies of 310 kinds of abundant genes with ≥0.05% content (10 clones) obtained from three libraries.

The inlet shows the number of low-redundant genes with ≤0.05% content at each redundancy.In order to examine the presence of bias on the expression frequency in different libraries, we compared the expression profiles of different libraries. Fig. 2A shows the comparison between frequencies of abundant genes with ≥0.1% content identified from the different pools (ARi and ARiS) of the same library (Lib-2). Although the plots scattered owing to the small sampling number, the correlation between two expression profiles was good (the correlation coefficient = 0.94). As listed in Supplementary Table 2, there were many genes for which several clones were obtained from one library but no clone from another library, suggesting that we should take the extent of sampling bias into account when we analyze a small number of samples.Comparison of frequencies of abundant genes.

The line represents the case without bias.Fig. 2B shows the comparison between frequencies of the different libraries, Lib-1 and Lib-2. Although the order of top 10 genes was different, the correlation was good on the whole (the correlation coefficient = 0.87). These two libraries were constructed from different lots of RNA using slightly different protocols. The variation may result from the difference of RNA lots rather than the difference of protocol. For example, it was reported that the expression level of CRYAB largely varied depending on the conditions of cell culture, such as heat stress38 or hypertonic stress.39 GAPDH was most abundant in Lib-1, but fifth in Lib-2. The expression level of GAPDH also varied with calcium,40 insulin,41 and oxygen42 in the culture medium. Thus, the difference of culture conditions may induce a different expression level and result in the library-dependent variation in the expression level of these genes.3.5. Estimation of the total number of genes composing the libraryThe cumulative number of gene occurrences was plotted as a function of the number of analyzed clones as shown in Fig. 3A. The cumulative number asymptotically increased but did not saturate within the analyzed range. The curve fitting was carried out using six asymptotic models, including negative exponential models and hyperbolic models. As a result, the best fitting was obtained by use of a hyperbolic curve, Dt = Stα/(β + tα), where Dt denotes the cumulative number of genes for the accumulated number t of sequenced clones, S is an asymptotic value, and α and β are parameters to be estimated from data. The obtained S was 14 348 for Lib-1 and 11 563 for Lib-2. Using the value for Lib-2, the cumulative gene number at 24 000 analyses was calculated to be 4578, which is similar to the observed value, 4513. Even if analyzing 48 000 and 96 000 clones, the cumulative gene number could merely reach 6177 (53.4%) and 7717 (66.7%), respectively.Estimation of the total number of genes composed of each library. (A) The cumulative number of gene occurrences, Dt, was plotted for t, the accumulated number of sequenced clones. In this study, novel gene occurrence per 96 clones was counted. The best fitting curves were obtained using the hyperbolic equation described. The asymptotic value, S, represents the estimate of the total number of genes. (B) Abundance-based coverage estimator model ACE-1. The number of genes containing 10 or fewer clones was used to calculate the gene richness.Estimation of the total number of genes composed of each library.

(B) Abundance-based coverage estimator model ACE-1. The number of genes containing 10 or fewer clones was used to calculate the gene richness.Ida et al.43 estimated the number of total gene clusters in mouse retina EST libraries using the abundance-based coverage estimator model ACE. We applied its modified model ACE-1 to estimate the total number of genes composed of Lib-1 and Lib-2. When the number of genes containing 10 or fewer clones was used, the total number was estimated to be 8019 for Lib-1 and 8469 for Lib-2, as shown in Fig. 3B. These values were smaller than those estimated using the cumulative curves. Consequently, the total number of genes comprising the present library was estimated to be between 8000 and 14 000, and thus many genes would remain unidentified.3.6. TSSs of abundant transcriptsThe 5'-terminal sequence analysis of full-length cDNA clones has the advantage of massive production of TSSs.22 In particular, the full-length content of the vector-capped cDNA library is so high that the distribution of TSSs of transcriptional initiation variants can be determined for abundant transcripts obtained from each library. The full-length content of the top 11 abundant genes was 94.0–100% for each gene cluster. In addition, truncated cDNAs were easily distinguishable, because most of them started at the position in the last exon and had no additional G at the 5' end.The distributions of TSSs for 11 genes, which were obtained from two libraries and DBTSS,44 were compared as shown in Supplementary Table 3. The most frequent TSS for each gene, except for RPL1 and CRYAB, was identical among three distributions. EEF1A1 showed almost only one TSS, but generally multiple preferential TSSs were observed in other genes. Fig. 4 shows examples of comparison among distributions of TSSs for GAPDH, ACTG1, and CRYAB. The preferential TSSs formed a cluster in the region of ∼10 nt, presumably owing to the presence of the TATA box upstream of these TSSs. CRYAB also showed widely scattered rare TSSs at the upstream region. In every gene, the distribution patterns of TSSs obtained from two libraries and DBTSS were similar. It should be noted that the data of DBTSS was obtained from various tissues, suggesting that the pattern of TSS distribution shows no tissue specificity in the case of abundant housekeeping genes. DBTSS represented TSSs generated by alternative promoter usage.44 The TSS observed in the first intron of GAPDH and VIM, and two TSSs identified at the position ∼1400 nt upstream of the main TSS cluster of CRYAB, may result from transcripts given by alternative promoter usage.Comparison among distributions of transcriptional start sites.

Long-sized transcriptsOn the basis of the mRNA size of RefSeq for genes with GeneID in Supplementary Table 2, the gene-based and clone-based average lengths of cDNA inserts of our full-length gene collection were calculated to be 2.46 kb (4378 genes) and 1.68 kb (19 758 clones), respectively. The previous paper showed that the V-capping method could synthesize a long-sized full-length cDNA.30 The present libraries also contained many long-sized full-length clones with a cDNA insert of ≥7 kb, as listed in Table 2. The size of the mRNA described in the RefSeq data was often different from the insert size of our cDNA clone because of size variants generated by alternative splicing or alternative polyadenylation. Therefore, cDNA clones that correspond to RefSeq derived from >6 kb mRNA were selected, and then the real size of the insert was examined by restriction enzyme digestion followed by agarose gel electrophoresis. Table 2 shows the determined size together with the mRNA size of RefSeq. Some clones were fully sequenced and their precise length was listed with an accession number.The longest cDNA of 11 199 bp encoded golgin B1 (GOLGB1), which is a Golgi integral membrane protein originally named ‘giantin’ owing to its huge size of ∼400 kDa.45 When compared with RefSeq, the coding region of this cDNA had two insertions of 15 bp each that resulted in the insertion of a total of 10 amino acid residues, implying an alternative-splicing variant. A total of nine single-nucleotide variations were observed, one of which was the insertion of one nucleotide A to an A stretch at position 2958–2965 in the coding region, causing a frame-shift. This insertion may result from misreading of reverse transcriptase during first-strand synthesis, because sequencing of the GOLGB1 locus of the ARPE-19 genome showed the absence of such an insertion.Redundant cDNA clones in the long-sized cDNAs of ≥8 kb were filamin A (FLNA) and filamin B (FLNB). As a result of full sequencing of a total of eight FLNA clones, three splicing variants were identified, whose exon–intron structures are depicted in Fig. 5A. V1 was the longest variant and three clones showed identical TSS. The V2 clones started at the 6th nucleotide downstream of the TSS of V1, and lacked the 29th exon, which caused deletion of eight amino acid residues. V3 had the same TSS as V2, and lacked the region from the middle of exon 36 to the middle of exon 41 of V1, which caused deletion of 305 amino acid residues. RefSeq seems to correspond to V2, but it is doubtful that it actually dose because RefSeq is constructed using multiple sequences reported by different researchers. Surprisingly, all four FLNB clones showed different splicing patterns, as shown in Fig. 5B.The exon–intron structure of splicing variants for FLNA (A) and FLNB (B). Arrow heads represent exon inclusion or deletion.The exon–intron structure of splicing variants for FLNA (A) and FLNB (B). Arrow heads represent exon inclusion or deletion.3.8. Correlation between the number of isolated full-length clones and mRNA contentThe high content of the very long-sized cDNA clones leads us to expect that the present library is unbiased by mRNA size. In order to assess the extent of bias, the mRNA contents for eight genes with different mRNA sizes (1.1–9.5 k) were measured by real-time PCR. As shown in Fig. 6, the total number of full-length clones obtained from the present libraries had good correlation with the content of each mRNA. GUK1 (1.1 k), RAI14 (5.0 k), and FLNB (9.5 k) showed a similar content and were represented by full-length cDNA clones with the number of the same order of magnitude independent of their mRNA sizes. Thus, the bias is expected to be low up to 9.5 kb, explaining the fact that a small-sized library composed of only 20 000 clones contained 48 long-sized full-length clones with a cDNA insert of ≥7 kb (Table 2).Correlation between the number of isolated full-length clones and the mRNA content. The size of mRNA was described in parentheses following each gene symbol.Correlation between the number of isolated full-length clones and the mRNA content. The size of mRNA was described in parentheses following each gene symbol.3.9. Unannotated transcriptsOf the 4513 full-length transcripts identified, 143 (3.2%) have not been included in Entrez Gene, but 79 out of them hit rare ESTs registered in the UniGene EST database. Although 19 clones did not hit any EST sequence, it did not necessarily mean they were novel genes because our clone may result from a partial sequence not overlapping with known ESTs. The unannotated transcripts can be classified into two groups. One group included an intergenic transcript that was mapped to the gene-unoccupied space between known gene loci. Many of them were transcribed from just upstream of TSS of the known gene toward the opposite direction, presumably owing to the presence of a bi-directional promoter.46 The second group (36 genes) was composed of transcripts whose location overlapped the exon of the known gene, generating an antisense transcript against the known exon as listed in Supplementary Table 4. The antisense transcript against the first exon of the known gene is especially intriguing because of possible involvement in transcriptional regulation. The corresponding ESTs often existed in the UniGene EST database, but they were assigned to the sense strand of the known gene.4. DiscussionIn-depth analysis of the full-length cDNA libraries constructed using the V-capping method has revealed that these libraries contained full-length cDNA clones with a wide range of sizes up to 11 kb, suggesting that they meet the requirement for size-unbiased libraries. This success may be attributed to the following reasons. (i) Total RNA was used as a template without purifying poly(A) RNA. (ii) The protocol of cDNA synthesis did not include an intact mRNA selection process such as modification of the cap structure.4–6 These purification and modification processes might cause mRNA degradation. (iii) A small amount of mRNA was used as a template for reverse transcription. When a large amount of mRNA is used, the synthesis of short abundant cDNAs may consume reverse transcriptase and nucleotide substrates, and rare or long-sized cDNA synthesis may be suppressed. (iv) Size fractionation of cDNAs was not carried out. (v) Restriction enzyme digestion of cDNA was not included. (vi) PCR amplification was not used. (vii) Insertion of cDNA into a small-sized vector of 3.4 kb was done by self-ligation. One conceivable size bias may result from incomplete extension of the first-strand cDNA synthesized from a long-sized mRNA template. The presence of GOLB1 cDNA with an 11.2 kb insert and multiple FLNA cDNAs with an 8.2 kb insert suggested that the termination of reverse transcriptase was not problematic under the present conditions.The present analysis also revealed that the full-length content was unexpectedly high despite lacking a full-length selection process. The full-length content of abundant transcripts was 94.0–100%. The most probable explanation for this high content is that most mRNA molecules are intact in the cell. However, the degradation of mRNA, especially long-sized mRNA, seemed to occur during the RNA isolation process. The overall full-length content was 95%, and analysis of the remaining 5% incomplete cDNAs showed that ∼10% of them were derived from the degradation product of the long-sized mRNA of >6 kb (data not shown). Although a size bias due to RNA degradation during the course of its isolation is inevitable, this method can faithfully reflect the composition of a given purified RNA sample.The high full-length content and size-unbiased feature of the library enabled us to determine the fine distribution of TSS of genes expressed in a single type of cell. Recently, methods such as CAGE12 or 5'SAGE13 have been developed to determine the distribution of TSS. For these analyses, a vector-capped library prepared using a modified vector primer for CAGE or 5'SAGE analysis can serve as a starting material. The additional G at the 5' end could ensure the intactness of TSS and provide more precise results.The vector-capped cDNA library also enabled us to analyze the presence of a cap structure at the 5' end of mRNA. The large-scale TSS analysis revealed that a small part of full-length clones lacked an additional 5'-end G, indicating the absence of the cap structure of the mRNA. The common feature of the 5'-end sequence of these clones was a pyrimidine-rich sequence or A-starting sequence. Further in-depth analysis of G-free clones suggested that the 5'-end sequence affected the addition or elimination of the cap structure. This finding may partially be explained by the recent results that human decapping enzyme Dcp2 preferentially binds to a subset of mRNAs and identifies sequences at the 5' terminus of the mRNA as a specific substrate.47 Further investigation is required to elucidate the mechanism of the cap-free mRNA generation observed in the present study and its biological meaning.We identified 4513 kinds of genes out of 19 951 full-length clones isolated from unamplified ARPE-19 cDNA libraries. The total number of genes consisting of the present library was estimated to be 8000–14 000, which is consistent with ∼10 000 estimated for the transcriptome of RPE using UniGene clusters, SAGE tags and ESTs by Swaroop and Zack.48 The expression profile analyses using a microarray with 12 600 gene probes identified 5634 ± 65 genes for ARPE-19 and 5580 ± 84 genes for human RPE.49 These results suggest the low expression level of unidentified genes that may include non-coding and antisense genes. In order to obtain the remaining rare genes, further large-scale analyses in combination with subtraction/normalization are required.Recent investigations have shown that an unexpectedly large amount of alternative splicing variants exist23 and that some variants were expressed in a cell-specific manner.50 In order to analyze a transcriptional network in a single type of cell, it is necessary to measure the expression levels of these variants. When alternative splicing occurs at the multiple sites, it is difficult to quantify each variant by the RT–PCR method, which measures only the expression level of a limited region of mRNA. The most precise method for determining the expression level of a splicing variant is to count the number of full-length cDNA clones for each variant. This is a particular requirement for long-sized full-length transcripts. The present study demonstrated that multiple splicing variants for long-sized genes such as FLNA and FLNB were expressed in a single type of cell and that the V-capping method was able to provide unique genuine full-length cDNA to each variant. The physiological role of each variant remains to be solved.One of the characteristics of the V-capping method is the use of a vector primer with a relatively long dT tail, which has the following merits compared with the use of an oligo dT primer by conventional methods: (i) the unidirectional insertion of the cDNA is guaranteed and makes it easy to identify an antisense transcript against the known gene; (ii) it does not prime a short A-stretch in the mRNA, not generating 3'-truncated cDNAs that were occasionally observed in the RefSeq database (e.g. N4BP2 in Table 2). However, we should keep in mind the possibility that the vector primer could fail to capture mRNA with a short poly(A) tail.The remaining challenge to analyzing the vector-capped cDNA library is to develop a method for high-throughput single-pass sequencing. When we intend to analyze >100 000 clones, the present single-pass sequencing strategy is not realistic because of high cost and because of the amount of work involved. However, considering that the analysis of the present high-quality full-length cDNA library is expected to enable discovery of rare or long-sized full-length cDNA clones and fine expression profiling of various variants, it makes sense to analyze more than a million clones corresponding to total clones composed of one library. Thus, developing a novel method for massive single-pass sequencing is desired, for example, by applying recently developed technologies.51 Furthermore, in order to achieve a comprehensive collection of full-length transcripts, the removal of abundant clones should be carried out by subtraction.In conclusion, a full-length cDNA library constructed with the V-capping method has been shown to meet requirements for a size-unbiased library, and thus is expected to be suitable for the comprehensive collection of full-length transcripts and their fine expression profiling. Recently, Miura et al.52 analyzed full-length cDNA libraries constructed from budding yeast using the V-capping method and identified novel full-length transcripts, including splicing variants and antisense transcripts.52 Even for well-characterized organisms such as yeast, in-depth analysis of the vector-capped cDNA library has been shown to still bring discovery of novel full-length transcripts. To analyze the transcriptome of not only uncharacterized organisms but also well-characterized ones such as human and mouse, the V-capping method will become the first choice for constructing a full-length cDNA library.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was partly supported by a grant for the Genome Network Project from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology.

IntroductionThe entire human genome sequence has allowed us to create a provisional catalog of human transcripts and proteins by a combination of computational predictions and information from experimentally collected cDNA sequences.1 Although approximately 23 000 protein-coding genes have been assigned to the human genome by the Ensembl database (NCBI built 36, Ensembl 48; http://www.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/index.html),2 the functional roles of the respective gene products remains to be experimentally explored. Because of the importance of these studies, many groups have started to collect a set of protein-coding sequences, conventionally termed open reading frames (ORFs), in a genome-wide manner, so-called ‘ORFeome cloning’. ORF clones serve as versatile reagents for the functional and structural studies of proteins.3–5 Therefore, various systems have been developed to enable efficient large-scale cloning and expression of ORF clones. Currently available systems rely on either site-specific recombinases or rare-cutting restriction enzymes for the transfer of ORFs between expression vectors. These systems allow the correct orientation and reading frame to be maintained after transfer.6–8 The Gateway and Creator cloning systems, which are representative of the recombinase-based systems, transfer ORFs by λ-att recombination using the 25-bp attB site, and Cre-loxP recombination using the 34-bp lox-P site upstream of the ORF, respectively.7 On the other hand, restriction-enzyme-based systems are less frequently used at present, although a commercial system has recently emerged that is as efficient as those based on recombinases. The Flexi® cloning system can manipulate ORFs using rare-cutting restriction enzymes, SgfI and PmeI, after the addition of these 8-bp restriction sites to the flanking 5′ and 3′ ends of the ORFs, respectively.8 We previously prepared a set of ORF clones for human KIAA genes using a Gateway-type vector.9 Furthermore, we created the ORF clones as fusion proteins with green-fluorescent protein to analyze the subcellular localization of the proteins in cultured cells and to evaluate the in vitro expression of ORF clones.9 However, when we wish to carry out alternative functional studies beyond bioimaging, the Gateway system requires re-construction of appropriate expression plasmids for the creation of differently tagged proteins. This creates a serious bottleneck in the use of our large ORF clone set for functional genomics analysis. Thus, we started to look for a more versatile tag system that would allow us to carry out both bioimaging and biochemical experiments using a single tag. Within this context, we considered a recently emerging technology, commercially designated as HaloTag® technology.10 This technology is quite attractive since HaloTag can be used not only for bioimaging, but also for various proteomic applications involving fusion protein immobilization. Although similar technologies have been developed, such as SNAP-tag which uses a modified human O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyl transferase as the tag,11,12 we preferred HaloTag® technology because we felt it may be more suitable for studies in mammals. Haloalkane dehalogenase, the enzyme from which HaloTag is derived, does not exist in mammalian cells, unlike O6-alkylguanine DNA alkyl transferase. Since HaloTag® technology was available in the Flexi® cloning system, we were strongly motivated to examine whether the Flexi® cloning method was suitable for preparation of a large number of ORF clones, and whether it would be useful for downstream functional characterization.In this study, we prepared nearly 2000 ORF clones using the Flexi® cloning method, and the resultant ORF clones were examined with respect to production in cell-free protein synthesis systems as HaloTag-fusion proteins. The results indicated that the Flexi® cloning method was as efficient as the Gateway cloning method and that the Flexi ORF clones consistently produced equal or larger amounts of HaloTag-fusion proteins than Gateway clones in in vitro protein production systems. We also examined the subcellular localizations of 40 HaloTag-fusion proteins in HEK293 cells and confirmed that the results were equivalent to those of the corresponding Monster Green® Fluorescent Protein (MGFP)-fusion proteins. Taken together, these results indicate that the Flexi ORF clone set can perform efficient functional analyses of human genes and provide an alternative resource for the human ORFeome project.2. Materials and methods2.1. MaterialspTD1 plasmid was obtained from Shimadzu (Kyoto, Japan). pF1Kof vector, which was constructed by flipping the AccIII–AgeI 832-bp DNA fragment including the origin of replication in the pF1KT7 (Promega, Madison, USA) vector, was kindly provided by Promega Corporation. pF3AHT vector was constructed by inserting the blunt-ended EcoICRI–SalI 946-bp DNA fragment from the pFC8A (HT) vector (Promega) into the EcoICRI site of the pF3A WG (BYDV) (Promega) vector backbone in the appropriate order for production of a C-terminal HaloTag-fusion protein. pFC8A (MGFP) was constructed by replacing the HaloTag gene with the MGFP gene from the phMGFP vector (Promega). For construction of HaloTag-fusion KIAA protein expression clones in the pTD2-Gateway and pTD2-Flexi vectors, KIAA ORFs with the HaloTag sequence were extracted from pF3AHT ORF clones. The ORFs for the synthetic firefly luciferase gene (luc2), HaloTag, and Venus were obtained from pGL4.10[luc2], pFC8A vector (Promega), and (EYFP-F46L/V68L/M153T/V163A/S175G)/pCS2 kindly provided by Dr. Atsushi Miyawaki (Brain Science Institute, RIKEN),13 respectively, by PCR and were subcloned into the pF1KT7 Flexi vector. Each ORF was transferred to seven different kinds of modified pTD2 expression vectors whose cloning sites were flanked at both sides with specified sequences. The D5 vector, which carried a 10-bp sequence (AATCGAATTC) in place of the 5′-polyhedrin enhancer sequence, was also used in the preparation of the luc2 expression plasmid. pFC8KHT-Memb, pFC8KHT-NLS, pFC8KHT-ER, pFC8KHT-Golgi, and pFC8KHT-Mito were constructed by ligation of DNA fragments containing localization signal sequences, with the pFC8K (HaloTag) vector digested by SgfI and EcoICRI (Carboxy Flexi® System, Promega). The localization signal fragments (abbreviated as Memb, NLS, ER, Golgi, and Mito) were amplified by PCR from the following expression clones (BD, Franklin Lakes, USA) with each primer appended by SgfI or PmeI sites at the 5′ end: Memb, a membrane-localized signal from N-terminal sequence of neuromodulin (pEYFP-Mem); NLS, a nuclear localization signal from a triple repeat of NLS from SV40 large T-antigen (pDsRed2-Nuc); ER, an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) targeting sequence from calreticulin (pDsRed2-ER); Golgi, a Golgi-localized signal from beta 1,4-galactosyltransferase (pEYFP-Golgi); and Mito, a mitochondrial targeting sequence from subunit VIII of cytochrome c oxidase (pDsRed2-Mito). HaloTag Cy5 ligand was prepared by the coupling of HaloTag Amine (O4) ligand (Promega) and Cy5 Mono-Reactive Dye Protein Array Grade (Amersham Biosciences, Piscataway, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Anti-HaloTag IgG was generously provided by Promega Corporation. Escherichia coli strain JC8679 (recB21, recC22, sbcA23, thr-1, leuB6, phi-1, lacY1, galK2, ara-14, xyl-5, mtl-1, proA2, his-4, argE3, rpsL31, tsx-33, supE44, his-328) was obtained from the Health Science Research Resources Bank (HSRRB) of the Japan Health Sciences Foundation.2.2. Preparation of Flexi ORF clonesThe ORF of interest was amplified from 1 to 4 ng of a plasmid DNA using 0.5 units of PrimeSTAR™ HS DNA polymerase (Takara Bio, Shiga, Japan) in a 20-μL PCR reaction mixture that included 0.2 mM each of four dNTPs and 0.5 μM each of the gene-specific primers (5′-CCCCGCGATCGCCATG N17-3′ and 5′-CCCCGTTTAAAC N20-3′, where N17 indicates a 17 nt-sense sequence downstream from the start methionine codon of ORF and N20 indicates a 20 nt-anti-sense sequence upstream from the stop codon), under the following PCR conditions: 95°C for 2 min/30 cycles of 98°C for 10 s and 68°C for 3 min/68°C for 5 min. In some cases, 0.5 units of KOD-Plus-DNA Polymerase (Toyobo, Osaka, Japan) was used in a 25-μL PCR reaction mixture that included 0.2 mM each of four dNTPs, 1 mM MgCl2 and 0.3 mM each of the gene-specific primers under the following PCR conditions: 94°C for 2 min/30 cycles of 98°C for 10 s, 55°C for 30 s/68°C for 3 min. One-third of the resultant amplified PCR products was digested by SgfI and PmeI in a 10‐μL reaction mixture of Flexi® buffer with 1× Flexi® Enzyme Blend (SgfI and PmeI) (Promega) for 30 min at 37°C after purification of the PCR products using Wizard SV 96 PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). After inactivation of the restriction enzymes by incubation for 20 min at 65°C, one-sixth of the digested PCR product was ligated with 25 ng of the SgfI- and PmeI-digested pF1K T7 vector in a 10‐μL reaction of Flexi® Ligase buffer with 10 units of T4 DNA Ligase (Promega) for 60 min at 25°C. One microliter of the ligation reaction was used to transform 10 μL of JM109 Competent Cells (>108 cfu/μg, Promega), and the transformants were selected on LB agar plates containing 50 μg/mL of kanamycin. A randomly chosen clone was first examined using the CloneChecker™ System (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, USA) by estimating the size of the supercoiled plasmid DNA. For ORFs cloned by the PCR cloning method, entire sequences were determined with the BigDye Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, USA), with sequencing primers designed every approximate 400 bp in a single strand of ORF. The sequence data were obtained with ABI PRISM 3700 or 3130, and analyzed with SEQUENCHER™ sequence assembly software (Gene Codes Co., Ann Arbor, USA). For ORF Trap cloning, the ORF of interest was transferred to pF1Kof vector using a homologous recombination system in E. coli (JC8679), according to the method previously described.9 For Flexi® Vector cloning using the pENT entry clones we had previously constructed,9 the ORF of interest was recovered by digestion with BstBI and SnaBI restriction endonucleases whose recognition sites were located upstream and downstream of the ORF, respectively, in the vector portion. It was then inserted between the BstBI and SnaBI sites of the pSP73Flexi-1 vector, which contains SgfI and PmeI sites upstream and downstream of the BstBI and SnaBI sites, respectively. After cloning the ORFs into the pSP73Flexi-1 vector, they were cut with SgfI and PmeI restriction endonucleases and then re-cloned between the SgfI and PmeI sites of the pF1K vector.2.3. In vitro protein productionFor in vitro translation systems using Wheat Germ Extract Plus (WGEP) (Promega) and a TransDirect insect cell lysate (TD) (Shimadzu, Japan), RNA synthesis was performed using the T7 RiboMAX Express Large Scale RNA Production System (Promega) with linearized template DNAs, according to the supplier's instructions. After purification with the RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), RNAs were concentrated by ethanol precipitation and dissolved in 15 μL of DEPC-treated water. In vitro translation reactions were performed in a reaction volume of 10 μL using 2.4 and 3.2 μg of the RNA for the WGEP and the TD systems, respectively, following the supplier's recommendation unless otherwise stated. For the TnT SP6 High-Yield Protein Expression (HYPE) System (Promega), approximately 400 ng of TempliPhi-amplified pF3AHT HaloTag-fusion protein expression clones were used as a template in a 10-μL reaction, according to the manufacturer's instructions. For production of radiolabeled proteins, 2.86 µCi of 35S-labeled Redivue Promix (a mixture of l-[35S]methionine and l-[35S] cysteine) (GE Healthcare, USA) was added in the reaction. The TempliPhi (GE Healthcare) reaction was conducted by denaturation of 10–30 ng of DNAs with 5 μL of Denature buffer for 3 min at 95ºC followed by polymerization for 16 h at 30ºC. For the HaloTag tetramethylrhodamine (TMR) ligand labeling of the in vitro produced HaloTag-harboring proteins, 2.3 μL of 1 μM HaloTag-TMR ligand (Promega) was added after the in vitro reaction (10 μL) and the mixture was incubated for 5–10 min at room temperature. After the addition of 4.2 μL of 4× Laemmli's SDS sample buffer, the products were resolved on a MDG-267 Real Gel Plate (concentration gradient: 5–10%; Biocraft, Japan) by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis in the presence of SDS (SDS–PAGE).2.4. Examination of the effects of the flanking sequences of ORF on in vitro production of luciferase, Venus, and HaloTagFor in vitro luc2 production, 1.4 μg of RNAs were used for WGEP and 3.8 μg for TD in a reaction volume of 12 μL. The activities of luc2 in an aliquot of the reaction mixture (10 μL) were assayed using the Dual-Glo Luciferase Assay System (Promega) according to the supplier's instructions. Luminescence was detected in a GloMAX 96 Microplate Luminometer (Promega). In vitro syntheses of Venus proteins were performed in 20 μL using 4.8 and 6.4 μg of the template RNA in the WGEP and the TD systems, respectively, after removing turbidity by centrifugation at 15 000 rpm for 2 min. Fluorescent signals were detected in the Applied Biosystems 7500 Fast Real-Time PCR System after 2 and 5 h reactions in the WGEP and TD systems, respectively. HaloTag-TMR ligand binding was monitored for quantification of the active HaloTag protein. Two microliters of 5 μM HaloTag-TMR ligand was added to an 8-μL reaction mixture, and the mixture was incubated at 25°C for 5 min. The binding reaction was stopped by adding 2 μL of 6× Laemmli's SDS sample buffer and then boiling at 100°C for 5 min. The solution (7.5 μL) was analyzed on 12.5% SDS–PAGE. Fluorescent signals from TMR were detected and quantified with FLA-3000 (Fujifilm, Tokyo, Japan) and MultiGauge image analyzing software (Fujifilm).2.5. Western blottingFor Western blot analysis of HaloTag-fusion proteins, the proteins separated by SDS–PAGE were electrophoretically transferred onto a PVDF membrane (FluoroTrans W; PALL, Portsmouth, UK) using the transfer buffer [25 mM Tris–Cl (pH 8.3), 192 mM glycine, 20% (V/V) methanol] with the BIOCRAFT BE-300 semidry transfer device (Biocraft, Tokyo, Japan). HaloTag-fusion proteins were detected as follows. The resultant PVDF membrane was washed with TBS [20 mM Tris–Cl (pH 7.5) and 150 mM NaCl] including 0.05% Tween-20 (TBST) for 10 min with gentle agitation. After pre-incubation of the membrane with TBST containing 5% skim milk for 60 min, the membrane was incubated with 1:30 000 rabbit anti-HaloTag IgG antibody (Promega) in TBST containing 1% skim milk for 60 min. After washing with TBST for 5 min four times, the membrane was further incubated with 1:30 000 horseradish-peroxidase-conjugated anti-rabbit IgG antibody (Promega) in TBST containing 1% skim milk for 60 min. After washing the membrane with TBST, HaloTag-fusion proteins were finally detected using ECL plus (GE Healthcare) according to the manufacturer's instructions. The luminescent images were recorded by a Luminescent Image Analyzer LAS3000 (Fujifilm). MagicMark XP Western Protein Standard (Invitrogen) was used for estimation of the apparent molecular masses of the HaloTag-fusion proteins.2.6. Examination of the subcellular localization of HaloTag-fusion proteinsThe human embryonic kidney (HEK) 293 cell line was obtained from HSRRB of the Japan Health Sciences Foundation. HEK293 and COS-7 cell lines were grown in DMEM supplemented with 10% of Tet System Approved Fetal Bovine Serum (BD) and 1× Antibiotic–Antimycotic reagent (100 U/mL penicillin + 100 μg/mL streptomycin + 0.25 μg/mL amphotericin B; Invitrogen). HEK293 and COS-7 were transfected with expression clones using FuGENE6 Transfection Reagent (Roche Diagnostics, Basel, Switzerland) in an 8-well chambered coverglass (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Rochester, USA) according to the supplier's instructions. Cells (200 μL, 4 × 104) were plated 24 h before transfection. After 16–24 h of transfection, HaloTag-fusion proteins and DNA were labeled with medium with 1 μM of HaloTag-TMR ligand and Hoechst (33342, 3.3 μg/mL, final concentration; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, USA) for 15 min in a CO2 (5%) incubator at 37ºC. After washing four times with 300 μL of medium, the cells were incubated for 0.5–24 h in a CO2 incubator and the subcellular localization of HaloTag- or MGFP-fusion proteins were observed with a Biozero fluorescence microscopy system (Keyence, Osaka, Japan) with 605/55 and 535/50 nm filters. Photos labeled with Hoechst33342 were merged with those of MGFP- or HaloTag-fusion proteins and the subcellular localizations of MGFP- and HaloTag-fusion proteins were compared.3. Results and discussion3.1. Construction of Flexi ORF clonesLed by the motivation described in Section 1, we have initiated preparation of Flexi® Vector ORF clones using human cDNA clones accumulated by the Kazusa cDNA project.14,15 So far, 1929 Flexi ORF clones have been constructed in a pF1K vector format. The list of the Flexi ORF clones is accessible at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org (Supplementary Table S1). These Flexi ORF clones contained relatively large ORFs derived from 1163 KIAA and 766 known genes, the average sizes of which are 2.8 and 2.4 kb, respectively. ORFs of 341 pF1K clones were PCR-cloned using PrimeStar HS or KOD plus high-fidelity DNA polymerases, as described in Section 2. All ORF clones obtained by PCR cloning were sequence-verified and we found that the PCR mutation occurrence rate was less than 5 × 10−5 mutations per residue under the conditions employed in this study. ORF clones with large ORFs are inevitably at higher risk of having artificial missense mutation(s) introduced by PCR, thus we previously developed and applied the ORF Tap cloning method for the construction of Flexi ORF clones for some relatively long ORFs (mainly those >2 kb).9 The method is based on a homologous recombination in E. coli JC8679 and thus is very unlikely to introduce mutation(s) into ORFs during cloning. We therefore considered that this method was also highly suited to the preparation of Flexi ORF clones because reconfirmation of the ORF sequence could be avoided.16–18 Within this context, 842 pF1K clones were constructed by the ORF Trap cloning method. The remaining 749 pF1K clones, termed Flexi_RBS type, were constructed by transferring ORF sequences from the Gateway entry clones we had previously prepared to the pF1K vector, because the 5′- and 3′-untranslated sequences (UTRs) have been already trimmed out in the Gateway entry clones. These clones contained a 19-bp fragment, including a ribosome-binding site (RBS), between the SgfI site and a translational initiation codon. These Flexi clones were distinguished from others by adding ‘SD’, representing a Shine-Dalgarno sequence as an indication of the presence of an RBS, to their clone IDs, whereas the other pF1K clones were simply termed Flexi type. The ORF flanking sequences in these Flexi clones are shown in Fig. 1A. The SgfI site was placed one base upstream of the initiation codon, which allowed the production of recombinant proteins with the native translational initiation site or with N-terminal tags using appropriate Flexi® vectors. On the other hand, the PmeI site was placed just downstream from the original stop codon of the ORF, which resulted in an attachment of the Val in Flexi type or the Tyr–Val–Val in Flexi_RBS type to the carboxy end of the native ORF. When an ORF sequence flanked by SgfI and PmeI was cloned between the SgfI and EcoICRI sites of a Flexi® vector, the translational stop codon was destroyed and thus the protein was expressed as a carboxy-terminal fusion. ORFs in pF1K clones thus prepared can be easily transferred to other types of Flexi® vectors following digestion with SgfI and PmeI (Fig. 1B).ORF transfer in the Flexi® Vector cloning system. (A) Flanking sequences of ORF in Flexi clones. Recognition sequences of SgfI and PmeI are indicated as green and red characters, respectively.

The appropriate promoter is indicated as an orange arrow in the vectors.ORF transfer in the Flexi® Vector cloning system. (A) Flanking sequences of ORF in Flexi clones.

Comparison of the productivities of HaloTag-fusion proteins from Flexi ORF clones and Gateway ORF clones in two in vitro protein production systemsSince our focus is on the use of HaloTag® technology, we initially prepared a set of Flexi ORF clones as HaloTag-fusions using the Flexi® cloning method. To examine the utility of HaloTag® technology, HaloTag-fusion products were produced in in vitro translation systems. The expressed proteins were analyzed on SDS–PAGE after labeling with a HaloTag-TMR ligand. This simple labeling procedure enabled us to fluorometrically detect only proteins carrying a HaloTag portion on SDS–PAGE, and thereby made it easy to check whether the ORF encoded an appropriately sized protein. Using this analysis, quantities of HaloTag-fusion proteins with ligand-binding activity could be directly estimated from the fluorescence intensities of protein bands on SDS–PAGE. In these experiments, we also compared the performance of two in vitro translation systems: one derived from a wheat germ extract and the second from an insect cell extract [commercially named WGEP and TransDirect (TD), respectively]. We used these systems because these eukaryotic cell extracts are known to produce larger amounts of proteins than conventional rabbit reticulocyte lysates. In parallel, we also compared the efficiency of protein synthesis by Gateway-type (pTD2-Gw) and Flexi-type (pTD2-Flx) expression constructs, where ORFs were flanked with different appended sequences that are associated with the respective cloning methods. These appended sequences may affect the translational activity of the HaloTag-fusion constructs in vitro. For this purpose, we constructed 13 sets of HaloTag-fusion protein expression plasmids using pTD2-Gw and pTD2-Flx vectors. pTD2-Flx is a simple Flexi-type HaloTag-fusion protein expression vector derived from the pTD1 vector for the TD system.19 This vector has 8-bp restriction enzyme recognition sites (SgfI and PmeI sites) flanked by the baculovirus polyhedrin 5′- and 3′-UTRs, respectively. pTD2-Gw is a hybrid expression vector derived from pTD2-Flx, which has 25-bp Gateway recombination sites, attB1 or attB2, between polyhedrin 5′-UTR and SgfI, or between PmeI and 3′-UTR, respectively (Fig. 2A). In both systems, protein production was directed by in-vitro-synthesized RNAs. Many fluorescent bands, probably resulting from proteolytic degradation, were observed in most samples. The fluorescence signal intensities of the largest bands were the expected size for the respective protein products, and each HaloTag-fusion protein was recorded for comparing the protein productivities of pTD2-Flx and pTD2-Gw (Fig. 2B, indicated by an arrow). In the TD system, the fluorescence intensities of 8 out of 13 HaloTag-fusion proteins in the pTD2-Gw format were less than 60% as intense as those derived from pTD2-Flx clones (Fig. 2B, upper lanes: 2, 3, 5, 8–11, and 13). On the other hand, in the WGEP expression system, the fluorescence intensities of HaloTag-fusion proteins from five fusion constructs in the pTD2-Gw vector were slightly reduced compared with those from pTD2-Flx fusion constructs (Fig. 2B, lower lanes: 3, 4, 8–10). Interestingly enough, the fluorescent band patterns of HaloTag-fusions produced in the TD and WGEP systems were considerably different from each other, although the same in-vitro-synthesized RNAs were subjected to both in vitro protein production systems. These results indicated that (1) the protein productivity of both the TD and WGEP systems varied widely from gene to gene, (2) TD and WGEP had different preferences for genes in terms of protein production, and (3) the Gateway recombination site(s) apparently had an inhibitory effect on translational activity, which was more prominent in the TD systems.Effects of appended sequences surrounding the ORF on translational activity in cell-free protein synthesis systems.

Effects of ORF-flanking sequences on translational activity in cell-free protein synthesis systemsWhile the different performances of the TD and WGEP systems were anticipated to some extent, it was not anticipated that the Gateway recombination sites would have an inhibitory effect on in vitro protein production. Thus, we further pursued the cause of this apparent inhibitory effect of the Gateway recombination sites on in vitro protein production. To systematically examine the effects of the appended sequences flanking the ORFs on in vitro protein production, we constructed systematically modified versions of expression clones for luc2, HaloTag, and Venus autofluorescent proteins, with different flanking sequences for each ORF (Fig. 2C). Protein production in the TD and WGEP systems was monitored by measuring luciferase activity, HaloTag-TMR ligand-binding activity, or the fluorescence intensity of Venus protein (Fig. 2D). As shown in Fig. 2C, these clones included flanking sequences derived from the Gateway attB sites (B1 and/or B2), or parts of the kanamycin-resistant gene (K1: ACTGGGCACAACAGACAATCGGCTG, or K2: CCTGTCATCTCACCTTGCTCCTGCC, as examples of non-specific sequences) between the translational enhancer (polyhedrin 5′-UTR) and the initiation ATG codon, and/or between the stop codon and the polyhedrin 3′-UTR. N–N, an expression clone without any additional sequences, was the control clone. N–B2 and N–K2 carry additional sequences (B2 and K2, respectively) only at the 3′-flanking site, whereas B1–N and K1–N have additional sequences (B1 and K1, respectively) only at the 5′-flanking site. K1 and K2 were spacer sequences with equal sizes as B1 and B2 and were not expected to be involved with the Gateway recombination. We also compared protein production from the Gateway-type expression vector (B1–B2) and the modified vector (B1–K2) in parallel. In total, we examined seven different expression vectors in these experiments. Figure 2D shows the relative activities of luc2, HaloTag, and Venus proteins produced in the TD and WGEP systems compared with the N–N type of pTDFlexi vector. Under these experimental conditions, the luciferase expression clones with attB1 sequence upstream of the ORFs (Fig. 2, B1–N, B1–B2, and B1–K2) appeared to exhibit only a slight inhibitory effect in the TD and WGEP systems in comparison with the pTDFlexi-luc2 construct (N–N in Fig. 2C). This reduction in protein productivity seemed to depend on the distance (39 nucleotides) between the 5′ translational enhancer and the initiation ATG but not the specific nucleotide sequence, at least in insect TD systems. Expression clones with short nucleotide sequences of the same length derived from the kanamycin-resistant gene also reduced the production of luciferase (Fig. 2D, upper, K1–N). Such an inhibitory effect was more evident for HaloTag and Venus protein production in the TD system. In fact, in the TD system, both HaloTag-TMR-ligand-binding activity and the fluorescence intensity of Venus decreased to less than 50% when the additional sequences were located upstream of the ORF (Fig. 2D, upper, B1–N, K1–N, B1–B2, and B1–K2). These results indicated that protein productivity in the TD system was affected by the increase in distance between the polyhedrin 5′-UTR and the start ATG, rather than by the flanking nucleotide sequence of the spacer.It was reported that the polyhedrin 5′-UTR in pTD1 displayed a strong translational enhancing activity, even in the wheat germ extract and rabbit reticulocyte lysate systems.19 The inhibitory effect of sequences upstream of the ORF was prominent in the TD system but only minor in the WGEP system (Fig. 2D, lower). Our results also showed that the expression clone lacking 5′-UTR considerably reduced the productivity of luciferase in both the TD and WGEP systems, indicating that the translational enhancer of 5′-UTR in pTD1 was functional in each system (Fig. 2D, D5). On the other hand, translational activity was largely unaffected by the spacing between the 3′-translational enhancer and the translational stop codon in all experiments using luc2, HaloTag, and Venus proteins (Fig. 2D, N–B2, N–K2). Taking all these results together, we concluded that the spacing between the 5′-translational enhancer and the translational initiation codon affected protein productivity, at least in vitro. Although the mechanism of the inhibitory effect on translational activity by spacing remains to be elucidated, it appears that nucleotide spacing between the enhancer and the initiation codon can sometimes affect translational activity. Because the distance between the 5′-translational enhancer and the initiation codon is shorter in the Flexi ORF clone than in the Gateway ORF clone, these results suggest that the Flexi ORF clone could be the clone of choice to consistently obtain high protein productivity in both the TD and WGEP systems. We consider this as another benefit of using the Flexi ORF clones, since production level is a serious concern, particularly when a recombinant protein is synthesized in vitro.3.4. Quality check of ORF clones from the viewpoint of in vitro protein productionBased on the results described above, we confirmed the functionality of a number of Flexi ORF clones produced as HaloTag-fusions in in vitro protein production systems. For this purpose, we used a transcription/translation coupled wheat-germ-cell-free protein synthesis system [TnT SP6 High Yield Protein Expression System, hereafter abbreviated as (TnT SP6 HYPES)] because the coupled system is easier and faster to operate and gives a higher yield of recombinant protein production than other uncoupled cell-free protein synthesis systems. Eight hundred and fourteen ORF sequences in pF1K clones were transferred to pF3AHT, C-terminal HaloTag-fusion protein expression vectors, by Flexi® cloning methods. One practical problem we encountered was that the coupled system required a large amount of expression plasmids to obtain the best results. Since we planned to use a small volume of E. coli culture (about 1 mL) to produce the plasmids, we were concerned that we would not be able to produce enough DNA to obtain good results in the TnT system. To solve this problem, we took advantage of in vitro amplification of expression plasmids. We found that DNA amplified with a TempliPhi rolling circle amplification kit could be used as template DNA in the TnT SP6 HYPES without any purification.20 This enabled us to examine the production of a number of HaloTag-fusions in a high-throughput manner. As a result, medium-sized and even relatively large proteins, composed of more than 1000 amino acid residues, were effectively produced and detected by Western blot analysis using anti-HaloTag IgG, with only small amounts of degraded or inappropriately initiated proteins (Fig. 3A). Moreover, most of the HaloTag-fusion proteins retained HaloTag ligand-binding activities (Fig. 3B). Of the 814 pF3AHT clones tested in the TnT system, 97% produced recombinant proteins that could be detected by TMR HaloTag ligand labeling and Western blot analysis using anti-HaloTag antibody. The apparent molecular masses of the recombinant proteins were estimated by SDS–PAGE followed by Western blot analysis using anti-HaloTag antibodies. Most of the proteins had apparent molecular masses that were consistent with the numbers of amino acid residues of the fused proteins (data not shown). Although the fluorescence intensity of TMR varied widely from protein to protein in a range of arbitrary fluorescence units from 10 to 10 000, HaloTag-fusions that retained the functional characteristics of TMR ligand-binding were efficiently produced. However, we did observe a tendency of HaloTag-TMR ligand binding to display decreases in fluorescence intensity with increases in protein size (Fig. 3C). These results are most likely explained by decreases in the production levels of larger HaloTag-fusions. However, it could also be explained on the assumption that the partner proteins may affect HaloTag-TMR ligand-binding activities. To address this, we examined the relationship between protein yields and their HaloTag ligand-binding activities for 53 HaloTag-fusions. In this experiment, the HaloTag-fusion protein yields were expressed by the radioactivity of [35S]methionine and [35S]cysteine incorporated into the proteins and divided by the number that contained methionine and cysteine, while the HaloTag ligand-binding activities were estimated from the fluorescence intensity of Cy5-labeled HaloTag ligand-bound HaloTag-fusion proteins on SDS–PAGE. The HaloTag-fusion protein yields and the HaloTag ligand-binding activities are plotted against the number of their amino acid residues in Fig. 3D and E, respectively. In Fig. 3F, the ratios of the HaloTag ligand-binding activities to the yields of the HaloTag-fusion proteins are plotted against the number of amino acid residues. The results indicated that the molecular HaloTag ligand-binding activities did not vary widely from fusion to fusion. Based on this result, we consider that the low ligand-binding activities observed resulted from low production levels of HaloTag-fusion proteins, although there may have been some exceptions.Expression of recombinant HaloTag-fusion proteins in an in vitro transcription/translation coupled protein synthesis system.

Subcellular localization of HaloTag-fusion proteins and MGFP-fusion proteinsIn general, information on the subcellular localization of proteins provides us with an important clue on potential protein function. Thus, we accumulated data of the subcellular localizations using green fluorescent protein (GFP)–ORF fusions constructed using the Gateway system. It was important for us to confirm that the subcellular localization revealed by HaloTag-fusions was consistent with the subcellular localization observed for GFP-fusions. First, we examined whether or not the HaloTag protein could be located in an expected subcellular compartment upon fusion of localization signals in COS-7 cells. To do this, we prepared pFC8A expression clones for the HaloTag protein containing signal sequences, such as membane-localized signal (Memb),21 nuclear localization signal (NLS),22 endoplasmic reticulum targeting sequence (ER),23 Golgi-localized signal (Golgi),24 and mitochondrial targeting sequence (Mito).25 These sequences were all placed at the N-terminal region of the HaloTag proteins. Eighteen hours after transfection of these constructs into COS-7 cells, the HaloTag-fusion proteins were labeled with the TMR ligand and observed with a fluorescence microscopy system. Figure 4A shows that all fused proteins were detected in an expected subcellular compartment, indicating that HaloTag proteins do not inhibit the function of these subcellular localization signals. Next, we directly evaluated whether HaloTag-fusion proteins were co-localized with the same GFP-fusion proteins when both fusions were expressed in the same cells. C-terminal HaloTag- and MGFP-fusion protein expression clones were prepared by the Flexi® cloning system using the Flexi ORF clones we prepared and pFC8A (HaloTag) and pFC8A (MGFP) vectors. After co-transfection of HEK293 cells with the same ORF clone fused to the two different fusion tags, HaloTag-fusion proteins were labeled with the TMR ligand and then the fluorescence images were obtained for TMR- (red) and MGFP-labeled (green) proteins for 40 ORFs. Examples of the cellular localization of the fusion proteins are shown in Fig. 4B. Among them, subcellular locations of glucocorticoid modulatory element-binding protein 2 (GMEB-2/KIAA1269), phosphatidylserine synthase 1 (PTDSS1/KIAA0024), membrane-bound transcription factor site-1 protease (MBTPS1/KIAA0091), and transmembrane protein 127 (TMEM127/KIBB2508) are reported in the UniProt Knowledgebase as nucleus/cytoplasm, membrane, endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi apparatus, and membrane, respectively (http://ca.expasy.org/sprot/).26 In contrast, the subcellular location of Mesoderm development candidate 2 (MESDC2/KIAA0081) is not mentioned and Secernin-1 (SCRN1/KIAA0193) is predicted to exist in the cytoplasm from similarities found in the database. The subcellular localizations of the 40 HaloTag-fusion proteins analyzed here were the same as those for MGFP-fusion proteins. These results indicate that HaloTag-fusion proteins can be used as an alternative for subcellular localization analysis in place of conventional autofluorescent proteins.Subcellular localization of HaloTag-fusion proteins in cultured cells. (A) Subcellular localization of transiently expressed HaloTag proteins with various signal sequences. COS-7 cells were transfected with pFC8A expression clones for HaloTag proteins containing signal sequences, such as plasma-membrane-localized signal (Memb), nuclear localization signal (NLS), ER targeting sequence (ER), Golgi-localized signal (Golgi), and mitochondria-localized signal (Mito) and HaloTag pHT2 vector which expresses HaloTag ORF (HaloTag).

Gene symbols and alias names are indicated beneath the photos.In conclusion, a complete set of ORF resources in various expression-ready clone formats clearly can serve as versatile sets of reagents for functional genomics research. The rapid, easy, and assured transfer of ORF sequences into different expression vectors is highly critical for this purpose, since many ORF clones are used in combination with protein fusion tags that allow functional analysis. Within this context, we selected a HaloTag protein as a fusion partner because we considered that HaloTag® technology would provide a wide range of utilities that include detection and purification as well as adaptability in functional studies. In fact, we have successfully used HaloTag-fusion proteins in other studies for pulse-chase labeling, protein–protein interaction, and chromosomal immunoprecipitation-like analyses along with bioimaging (unpublished data). In this report, we have shown that the Flexi® cloning method is suitable for the preparation of a large number of ORF clones into the pF1K vector and allows seamless implementation of HaloTag® interchangeable technology. Moreover, we have demonstrated that most human proteins were efficiently expressed as HaloTag-fusions in an in vitro coupled protein expression system, as well as in cultured mammalian cells. The resultant HaloTag-fusion proteins were biochemically active and successfully used for analyses of subcellular localization as an alternative to conventional autofluorescent proteins. Based on these results, we will accumulate a number of human ORF clones in the form of expression plasmids for HaloTag-fusion proteins, either C- or N-terminal fusions, in our ORFeome project since they will be directly used for functional studies, as well as for further transfer to another vector. HaloTag® technology provides a single fusion tag that can be utilized for a variety of structural and functional proteomic studies. Although there are a number of ORFeome resources for human genes that have been generated by Gateway recombinational cloning,27 a set of human Flexi ORF clones prepared as described would provide the research community with an important alternative for large-scale proteomic studies and a tool for individual research laboratories.Supplementary materialSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis project was supported in part by a grant for Promega‐Kazusa scientific collaboration from Promega Corporation and by a special grant for acceleration of the practical application of biotechnology from Chiba Prefectural Government.We would like to thank J.

Given that glycerol is shown to be naturally present in feces, the acquired ability to produce reuterin and cobalamin is an adaptive evolutionary response that likely contributes to the probiotic properties of L. reuteri.1. IntroductionLactobacillus reuteri is a heterofermentative lactic acid bacterium and is frequently found in the gastrointestinal tract of humans and other animals. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), probiotics are defined as live microorganisms which when administered in adequate amounts confer a health benefit on the host. Lactobacillus reuteri has been reported to exhibit “probiotic” properties.1,2 It has been extensively analyzed for probiotic applications, including its safe administration to healthy individuals, its ability to colonize the intestine, as a diarrhea therapeutic agent, as an inhibitor of bacterial pathogens, and the immunological modulation of the gastrointestinal mucosa.3–8 Some strains of L. reuteri have the ability to produce and excrete the broad-spectrum antimicrobial compound reuterin, which is structurally identical to 3-hydroxypropionaldehyde (3-HPA), during anaerobic metabolism of glycerol.9–11 The probiotic effects of L. reuteri have been proposed to be largely associated with the production of reuterin, and this antimicrobial substance is also an effective food preservative agent.12,13 This attribute of reuterin-producing L. reuteri strains is why they are frequently used as probiotic cultures in commercial dairy products worldwide.13The molecular basis for the probiotic effects of L. reuteri is not yet established. Although reuterin production is proposed to be important for its probiotic effects, the in vivo production of reuterin by L. reuteri has not been demonstrated. Lactobacillus fermentum is a closely related species based on a sequence analysis of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene (95% identity)14 and on phenotypic properties, including being an obligate heterofermentative organism.15 Previously, both these species were classified as a single species, L. fermentum, but were subsequently separated based primarily on DNA hybridization and GC content.15 Despite many similar phenotypic characteristics, probiotic effects have primarily been observed for L. reuteri, with a few studies suggesting probiotic properties for L. fermentum.16–18 To provide the framework for a comprehensive examination of the probiotic mechanisms of L. reuteri, we determined the complete genome sequences of the reuterin-producing L. reuteri JCM 1112T, which was isolated from human feces, and L. fermentum IFO 3956, which was isolated from fermented plant material, and compared them to the genomes of other available Lactobacillus genomes.19–26 Furthermore, we present in vivo evidence for the production of reuterin in the intestine of BALB/c mice.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome sequencingLactobacillus reuteri JCM 1112T, which was originally isolated from human feces, is a type of strain and was obtained from the Japan Collection of Microorganisms (JCM), Riken, Japan. Lactobacillus fermentum IFO 3956, which was originally isolated from fermented plant material, was obtained from the Institute for Fermentation, Osaka (IFO), Japan. Each strain was cultured in MRS broth (Oxoid) at 37°C for 18 h, and the genomic DNA was isolated and purified using standard genomic DNA affinity columns. The nucleotide sequences of the L. reuteri JCM 1112T and L. fermentum IFO 3956 genomes were determined by a whole-genome shotgun strategy. We constructed small-insert (2 kb) and large-insert (5 kb) genomic DNA libraries. Template DNA for sequencing was prepared by amplification of the DNA inserts using PCR with Ex-Taq (Takara Bio Inc.). Sequencing was subsequently carried out using the dye terminator strategy before precipitation with ethanol and running on ABI 3730xl (Applied Biosystems) and MegaBACE 4500 (GE Healthcare) capillary sequencers. We generated 27 456 reads (7.4-fold coverage) for JCM 1112T and 35 136 reads (9.5-fold coverage) for IFO 3956, respectively, from both ends of the genomic clones. Data were assembled with the Phred-Phrap-Consed program,27 and gaps were closed by direct sequencing of clones that spanned the gaps or of PCR products amplified with oligonucleotide primers designed to anneal to each end of neighboring contigs. The overall accuracy of the finished sequence was estimated to have an error rate of <1 per 10 000 bases (PHRAP score of ≥40).2.2. Sequence analysisAn initial set of open reading frames (ORFs) that likely encode proteins was identified using Glimmer 2.028 and overlapped ORFs, and those shorter than 120 bp were eliminated. All predicted proteins were searched against a non-redundant protein database (nr, NCBI) using BLASTP. The start codon of each ORF was manually refined from BLASTP alignments. The tRNA genes were predicted by the tRNAscan-SE29 and the rRNA genes were detected using BLASTN in a database of known bacterial RNAs. Functional classification of ORFs was conducted using the NCBI clusters of orthologous groups (COG) and LaCOG databases.25,30 Protein domains were identified using the Pfam database.31 The codon adaptation index for each protein was predicted using the cai program within the EMBOSS package32 based on the codon usage preference of genes encoding ribosomal proteins. Sequences were aligned with ClustalW, and BLASTP was used for protein comparisons. Orthologous genes were identified as the reciprocal best matches using BLASTP. The data were parsed by custom Perl script. Genome sequences of L. reuteri strains DSM 20016T (accession no. CP000705) and 100-23 (accession no. AAPZ00000000), which were determined by Joint Genome Institute (JGI), were obtained from GenBank. The genome sequence data of L. reuteri JCM 1112T and L. fermentum IFO 3956 have been deposited in GenBank/DDBJ/EMBL under accession nos. AP007281 and AP008937, respectively.2.3. Gnotobiotic mice assaysLactobacillus reuteri JCM 1112T and LRΔgupCDE were cultured on MRS agar at 37°C for 3 days before pelleting and resuspending in phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.2). BALB/c female mice (13 weeks old and 20–23 g) raised under germ-free conditions in the Gnotobiote Laboratory, University of Tokyo, were used.33 Three germ-free mice were inoculated orally with 0.5 mL of a suspension of each bacterial strain (108 cfu/mL). The mice bacterial counts of JCM 1112T and LRΔgupCDE were 107 cfu/g feces. To detect in vivo reuterin production from L. reuteri JCM 1112T in mono-associated mice, an intestinal loop assay was conducted under anesthetic.34 The front and back of the cecum was bound with twine, and 100 μL of 2 M 13C3-glycerol solution was injected. After 3 h, each mouse was killed by cervical vertebra dislocation and the cecal contents were collected.2.4. Analysis of glycerol metabolism in L. reuteri JCM 1112T using 13C3-labeled glycerol and 2D-NMRLactobacillus reuteri JCM 1112T and the mutant strain LRΔgupCDE were grown in 30 mL serum vials containing 20 mL of MRS broth with 200 mM 13C3-glycerol. Cultures were incubated in duplicate at 37°C for 10 h before 1 mL of each was sub-inoculated into new tubes for another 2.5 h incubation. An 0.1 mL aliquot of D2O was then added for 2D-NMR analysis. To measure the in vivo glycerol metabolism, metabolites were extracted with 0.5 mL of CD3OD from 1 g (wet weight) of JCM 1112T and LRΔgupCDE mono-associated murine cecal contents, as described previously.35 All NMR spectra of CD3OD-extracted sample solutions were recorded on a Bruker DRU-700 spectrometer equipped with a Z-axis gradient and a Bruker DRX-500 spectrometer equipped with a triple axis gradient. The temperature of the NMR samples was maintained at 298 K. A total of 128 complex f1 (13C) and 1024 complex f2 (1H) points were recorded with 32 scans per f1 increment for 2D-13C-HSQC36 and 2D-13C-edited HSQC37 spectra. The spectral widths were 12 000 and 8400 Hz for f1 and f2, respectively. In order to confirm signal assignments by 3JHH connectivity's, 2D-13C-HSQC-TOCSY spectra were recorded by a total of 64 complex f1 (13C) and 1024 complex f2 (1H) points using 32 scans per f1 increment.38 To quantify the signal intensities, a Lorentzian-to-Gaussian window with a Lorentzian line width of 10 Hz and a Gaussian line width of 15 Hz was applied in both dimensions, prior to Fourier transformation. A fifth-order polynomial baseline correction was subsequently applied in the f1 dimension. The indirect dimension was zero-filled to 2048 points in the final data matrix. 13C3-Glycerol was purchased from Cambridge Isotope Laboratories, Inc., and 1,3-propanediol and 3-hydroxypropionic acid were purchased from Tokyo Chemical Industry Co., Ltd.3. Results and discussion3.1 Genome features of L. reuteri JCM 1112T and L. fermentum IFO 3956The genomes of L. reuteri JCM 1112T and L. fermentum IFO 3956 each consist of single circular chromosomes of 2 039 414 and 2 098 685 bp, respectively, and both have no plasmids (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). The general features of both genome sequences are summarized in Table 1. The genomes of L. reuteri JCM 1112T and L. fermentum IFO 3956 contain 1820 and 1844 ORFs, respectively, and both shared 1265 ORFs. A high level of synteny is conserved between the two genomes (Fig. 1A). The close phylogenetic relationship is also evident from a comparative analysis of the ribosomal protein sequences from all lactobacilli, whose genomes have been sequenced, and thus the two species constitute a distinct group (Fig. 1B). Despite the close phylogenic relationship of L. reuteri and L. fermentum, the L. fermentum IFO 3956 genome has a significantly higher GC content (52%) than that of the L. reuteri JCM 1112T genome (39%) and the highest among the sequenced Lactobacillus genomes. This can be explained primarily by the GC content at the third codon position between L. reuteri JCM 1112T and L. fermentum IFO 3956 (32 versus 65%; Table 1).Genome-based phylogenetic analysis of L. reuteri JCM 1112T and L. fermentum IFO 3956.

It was expected that there would be minimum sequence differences between the two strains, because both are derived from the same original isolate, L. reuteri F275.39 However, an alignment of both genome sequences shows two large unique regions in L. reuteri JCM 1112T that result in a 40-kb increase in its genome (Supplementary Table S1). This highlights the tendency of bacteria to undergo significant genome changes during regular laboratory culturing and transfers. One unique region (JCM 1112T genome coordinates 442 995 to 451 429; unique region I) consists of 8435 bp and is flanked by a copy of IS4 on either end (LAR_0380 and LAR_0385), and the remnant (155 bp) of IS4 is present between orthologous genes (Lreu_0389 and Lreu_0390) at this position in the DSM 20016T genome. It is difficult to imagine that a pure culture stock picks up additional DNA, and thus DSM 20016T might have lost these genes. The unique region I contains the genes for enzymes involved in glycolysis (Supplementary Table S1). The other unique region (JCM 1112T genome coordinates 1 064 161 to 1 094 397; unique region II) consists of 30 237 bp and is bordered by an IS4 element (LAR_935) at one end and an IS200 element (LAR_959) on the other, both of which are also present at this position (Lreu_1000 and Lreu_1004) in the DSM 20016T genome. The unique region II contains the gene cluster encoding nitrate reductase subunits and the genes involved in molybdopterin biosynthesis (Supplementary Table S1). This gene cluster (LP_1473-1500) is also conserved in the genome of Lactobacillus plantarum WCFS1,19 and it is one of the variable regions in L. plantarum strains.40Biological roles were assigned to 1211 (67%) of the predicted ORFs for L. reuteri JCM 1112T, and 1212 (66%) for L. fermentum IFO 3956. Obligately heterofermentative lactobacilli, such as L. reuteri, L. fermentum, and Lactobacillus brevis, produce CO2, ethanol, acetate, and lactate from metabolism of glucose, whereas facultative heterofermentative and obligately homofermentative lactobacilli produce only lactate. The primary catabolic pathway for glucose metabolism in Lactobacillus is believed to be the glycolytic pathway. Surprisingly, the pfk gene encoding 6-phosphofructokinase is absent from the L. reuteri JCM 1112T and L. fermentum IFO 3956 genomes, and the fba gene for fructose-bisphosphate aldolase is also missing in IFO 3956. The pfk and fba genes are essential for the glycolytic pathway. The L. brevis genome also lacks the pfk and fba genes,25 suggesting that pfk and fba are key genes distinguishing homo- and hetero-fermentation. On the other hand, both have the complete gene set for the pentose phosphate pathway. These findings indicate that L. reuteri JCM 1112T and L. fermentum IFO 3956 use the pentose phosphate pathway to metabolize glucose (Fig. 2). Of all the ORFs in both genomes, 181 (10%) in JCM 1112T and 187 (10%) in IFO 3956 have no homolog in the other sequenced Lactobacillus genomes. Most of these genes encode conserved hypothetical proteins, but some with predicted functions are present. Genes encoding cobalamin biosynthesis are found only in JCM 1112T (described later) and genes encoding allantoate amidohydrolase (LAF_0160), isocitrate dehydrogenase (LAF_0939), isopropylmalate isomerase (LAF_0963-0965), and nitric oxide reductase (LAF_1644) are found only in IFO 3956. A COG analysis showed that L. reuteri JCM 1112T and L. fermentum IFO 3956 contain fewer glycosidases and no sugar ATP-binding cassette transporter when compared with other lactobacilli (data not shown). JCM 1112T contains the phosphoenolpyruvate:carbohydrate phosphotransferase systems (PTS) subunit IIC for cellobiose (LAR_0225) and galactitol (LAR_1559), but completely lacks other PTS enzyme II subunits. IFO 3956 has only two complete PTS enzyme II complexes for mannose (LAF_0391-0393) and sucrose (LAF_1579), but its gene-encoding mannose-6-phosphate isomerase is disrupted. Lactobacillus reuteri JCM 1112T and L. fermentum IFO 3956 apparently have a reduced capacity to utilize carbohydrates compared with other lactobacilli.Proposed glycerol and glucose metabolic pathways in L. reuteri JCM 1112T.

Several lines connect corresponding genes between the pathway and the cluster (enzymes, red; transporters, blue).3.2 Gene cluster for reuterin and cobalamin production in L. reuteri JCM 1112TSynthesis of reuterin is mediated by glycerol dehydratase (EC 4.2.1.30), which catalyzes the conversion of glycerol to 3-HPA, and this enzyme exists as a dimer of the three subunits α2, β2, and γ2 that exhibit significant sequence and structural similarities to the corresponding subunits of propanediol dehydratase.41 The glycerol dehydratase of some L. reuteri strains has been purified and characterized,42 but not at the sequence level. JCM 1112T contains three genes (LAR_1633-1635) with dehydratase subunit motifs (Pfam PF02286-02288) in the propanediol utilizing operon (LAR_1616-1640) (Fig. 2). The encoded proteins of these three genes showed sequence similarity to PduCDE (propanediol dehydratase) of Salmonella typhimurium43 and thus the three genes were designated gupCDE (glycerol utilization gene candidates in the pdu operon) in JCM 1112T. The pdu operon from Lactobacillus collinoides has been sequenced,44 and it is also present in the L. brevis genome,25 but the enzymatic activity has not been examined. Homologues for PduCDE have also been reported for Lactobacillus hilgardii and Lactobacillus diolivorans.45 A comparison of the pdu operon in L. reuteri JCM 1112T with L. brevis and L. collinoides reveals a conserved gene order (Supplementary Fig. S2). The encoded amino acid sequences of the gupCDE genes exhibit the highest identity to their homologues from L. brevis ATCC 367, showing 81, 66, and 57% identities, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S2). There is no synteny between the flanking region of the pdu operon of L. reuteri JCM 1112T and L. brevis ATCC 367.Both propanediol and glycerol dehydratase enzymes require cobalamin (vitamin B12) as a cofactor.41 JCM 1112T possesses the gene sets (cbi, cob, and hem) for cobalamin biosynthesis, and these are located adjacent to the pdu operon (Fig. 2). The structure of this gene cluster represents a close association of two operons (pdu and cbi-cob), and this is probably a reflection of the cobalamin requirement for glycerol dehydratase activity.41,46 These genes for cobalamin biosynthesis have not been identified in other lactobacilli including L. brevis. A comparison of this genetic locus with the corresponding locus in L. fermentum IFO 3956 and L. plantarum WCFS1 revealed that this pdu-cbi-cob-hem gene cluster comprising 58 ORFs (LAR_1583-1640), including 20 pdu genes (including gupCDE), 17 cbi genes, 6 cob genes, 4 hem genes, 1 pocR gene, 1 putative transposase gene, and 9 non-conserved ORFs, was apparently inserted into a locus that is common to all three bacteria (Fig. 3A). The pocR gene encodes a positive regulator of both the pdu and cbi-cob operons.47 The average GC content (25%) at the third codon of the ORFs in this gene cluster is significantly lower than that (32%) of the remaining ORFs in the JCM 1112T genome (Fig. 3A). In addition, there is a putative transposase gene (LAR_1612) at the boundary between the pdu and cbi-cob-hem operons (Fig. 2) and four IS elements within 20 kb of both the flanking regions of the pdu-cbi-cob-hem cluster in JCM 1112T. These data strongly suggest that the pdu-cbi-cob-hem cluster in L. reuteri JCM 1112T is a genomic island that has been acquired through lateral gene transfer. There is no direct repeat or tRNA gene in the flanking regions of this cluster, and the mechanism of the acquisition of this island is unclear. This finding is further supported from a comparison with the draft genome sequence data (total, 2.1 Mb) of L. reuteri 100-23, a rodent-specific strain, in which the pdu-cbi-cob-hem gene cluster is absent.(A) A comparison of the genomic location that contains the pdu-cbi-cob-hem gene cluster of L. reuteri JCM 1112T (center) with the corresponding location of L. fermentum IFO 3956 (upper) and L. plantarum WCFS1 (lower). Genes in the pdu-cbi-cob-hem gene cluster are depicted by arrows indicating the transcription direction with the same color codes as described in the Fig. 2. Genes conserved between the three genomes are colored gray and light blue bars indicate orthologous regions. The GC content at the third codon position of the ORFs in L. reuteri JCM 1112T is indicated under each ORF. Red lines represent the GC content at the third codon position of the ORFs in the pdu-cbi-cob-hem cluster (LAR_1583-1640). The blue horizontal line indicates the average GC content (32%) at the third codon position of the remaining ORFs in the L. reuteri JCM 1112T genome excluding the pdu-cbi-cob-hem gene cluster.

The blue horizontal line indicates the average GC content (32%) at the third codon position of the remaining ORFs in the L. reuteri JCM 1112T genome excluding the pdu-cbi-cob-hem gene cluster. (B) The pdu-cbi-cob gene cluster arrangement in L. reuteri JCM 1112T, S. typhimurium LT2, L. monocytogenes EGD-e, Y. enterocolitica subsp. enterocolitica 8081, and S. sanguinis SK36 are shown using the same color coding as described in (A).The pdu-cbi-cob gene cluster has been identified in the genomes of pathogenic bacteria such as Salmonella spp.,48Listeria spp.,49Shigella sonnei,50Yersinia enterocolitica,51 and Streptococcus sanguinis52 (Fig. 3B and Supplementary Fig. S2). However, the hem genes are clustered at different positions in the genomes of Yersinia, Shigella, and Listeria, and are scattered in the Salmonella genome. Only one gene (eutJ) of 12 ethanolamine utilizing genes (eut) in Listeria is encoded between pocR and pduF in JCM 1112T. Given the different gene organization of the pdu and hem operons, as well as a different codon adaptation index (CAI)53 between the pdu (0.55) and cbi-cob/hem (0.47) operons of JCM 1112T, it suggests that the pdu and cbi-cob/hem operons may have been independently inserted in these genomes and these clusters in L. reuteri JCM 1112T may have been generated by at least two independent insertion events rather than by a single event. However, the possibility that the pdu-cbi-cob gene cluster might have been formed prior to the integration into the JCM 1112T genome cannot be excluded.3.3 Production of reuterin and cobalamin by L. reuteri JCM 1112TThe gupCDE genes from L. reuteri JCM 1112T were cloned in Escherichia coli to experimentally examine their encoded glycerol dehydratase activity. Some glycerol dehydratase activity was detected in E. coli carrying gupCDE, but not in E. coli derivatives containing the individual genes (Supplementary Table S2), indicating that the gene products of gupCDE are the subunits of glycerol dehydratase. Wild-type L. reuteri JCM 1112T and a gupCDE knockout mutant (LRΔgupCDE) (Supplementary Fig. S3), grown in MRS broth supplemented with glucose and 13C3-glycerol, were analyzed using 2D-NMR to determine whether the proteins encoded by gupCDE can convert glycerol to 3-HPA. After 7.5 h incubation, 3-HPA was detected in JCM 1112T, but not in LRΔgupCDE under the same conditions (Supplementary Fig. S4). These results demonstrate that the glycerol dehydratase encoded by gupCDE in JCM 1112T can convert glycerol to reuterin, consistent with previous studies using L. reuteri 1063.9Lactobacillus reuteri JCM 1112T also possesses the gene (LAR_0029) encoding 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase (Fig. 2). While 1,3-propanediol was detected in JCM 1112T after 2.5 h incubation (Supplementary Fig. S4), 3-HPA was first detected after 7.5 h incubation during culture in the MRS broth. These results reveal that 1,3-propanediol accumulated faster and more abundantly through the fermentation of glycerol than 3-HPA in L. reuteri cells. Negative effects of accumulated 1,3-propanediol together with a lower pH and an increase in NAD+ may be involved in the subsequent accumulation and extracellular release of 3-HPA by L. reuteri, as was previously observed in the fermentation of glycerol involving 1,3-propanediol dehydrogenase in Enterobacter agglomerans.54 JCM 1112T produced neither 13C-labeled lactic acid nor 13C-labeled ethanol, which are fermentation end products (Supplementary Fig. S4). JCM 1112T cannot be grown in MRS broth in which glycerol is the sole carbon source (data not shown). Taken together, these observations indicate that fermentation of glycerol for energy and growth did not occur in L. reuteri, which is consistent with the lack of the gene for dihydroxyacetone kinase in JCM 1112T for conversion of glycerol to dihydroxyacetone phosphate prior to metabolism via the Embden–Meyerhof–Parnas pathway (Fig. 2).As discussed above, JCM 1112T contains the cbi-cob-hem gene cluster for cobalamin biosynthesis. Cobalamin production by L. reuteri was analyzed as described previously55 and was found to be present in the cell extract of JCM 1112T (Supplementary Table S3). This confirmed that JCM 1112T has the ability to produce both reuterin and cobalamin, consistent with the predicted gene products of the pdu-cbi-cob-hem gene cluster. It was previously demonstrated that adenosylcobalamin has a higher affinity for the glycerol dehydratase of L. reuteri than that of other Lactobacillus species.56 A high affinity of glycerol dehydratase for cobalamin may accelerate reuterin production by L. reuteri.3.4. In vivo production of reuterin by L. reuteri JCM 1112TIn vivo reuterin production by L. reuteri JCM 1112T was investigated using gnotobiotic mice mono-associated with JCM 1112T or its mutant derivative LRΔgupCDE. The intestinal loop assay of mono-associated mice was conducted 7 days after injection of a 13C3-glycerol solution into the murine cecum. The results revealed that reuterin was detected in samples taken from the cecum of gnotobiotic mice mono-associated with JCM 1112T, but not in mice mono-associated with LRΔgupCDE (Fig. 4). More rapid and abundant accumulation of 1,3-propanediol than that of 3-HPA was also observed in vivo, similar to the in vitro analysis (Supplementary Fig. S4). These results clearly demonstrated that glycerol dehydratase in L. reuteri converts glycerol into reuterin in vivo, supporting the hypothesis that the proposed probiotic effects of reuterin may occur in the intestine when glycerol is present. An analysis of the feces of untreated mice using NMR spectrometry and gas chromatography revealed 7–10 mM glycerol was present, suggesting the presence of glycerol in the intestine (data not shown). This is the first demonstration that the antimicrobial substance (reuterin) produced by L. reuteri can be produced in vivo in the gut under physiological conditions. This supports the genomic analysis as the genomic island encoding this phenotype, in this intestinal microbe, would likely not have been acquired unless it conferred a competitive advantage.In vivo detection of 3-HPA-hydrate derived from 13C3-glycerol in the cecal contents of mice colonized by wild-type L. reuteri JCM 1112T (A) and its mutant derivative, LRΔgupCDE (B), as detected by 2D 1H, 13C-HSQC NMR. δ1H (ppm) and δ13C (ppm) of 3-HPA-hydrate 2 (Hh-2) and 3-HPA-hydrate 3 (Hh-3) were observed at 2.43 and 42.6, and 3.79 and 61.6 at pH 7.0, respectively. Although the spot derived from 3-HPA-hydrate 1 (Hh-1) in 1H chemical shift was detected, the spot was not shown in (A), because the range of 1H chemical shift showed between 4.0 to 1.5 ppm. See Supplementary Figure S5 for details.In vivo detection of 3-HPA-hydrate derived from 13C3-glycerol in the cecal contents of mice colonized by wild-type L. reuteri JCM 1112T (A) and its mutant derivative, LRΔgupCDE (B), as detected by 2D 1H, 13C-HSQC NMR. δ1H (ppm) and δ13C (ppm) of 3-HPA-hydrate 2 (Hh-2) and 3-HPA-hydrate 3 (Hh-3) were observed at 2.43 and 42.6, and 3.79 and 61.6 at pH 7.0, respectively. Although the spot derived from 3-HPA-hydrate 1 (Hh-1) in 1H chemical shift was detected, the spot was not shown in (A), because the range of 1H chemical shift showed between 4.0 to 1.5 ppm. See Supplementary Figure S5 for details.3.5. ConclusionsThe complete genome sequences of L. reuteri JCM 1112T and L. fermentum IFO 3956 were determined. A comparative genome analysis suggested that L. reuteri JCM 1112T contains a specific gene cluster for reuterin and cobalamin production, and that the gene cluster is encoded on a genomic island that was acquired through lateral gene transfer. The pdu-cbi-cob gene cluster has also been identified in the genomes of some pathogenic bacteria, and previous studies have suggested that S. typhimurium acquired the pdu-cbi-cob gene cluster by horizontal transfer to enable it to degrade propanediol.43 As the pdu, cbi, and cob operons are not universally present in all salmonellae,57 it supports the hypothesis that the genes for propanediol utilization (pdu) and cobalamin biosynthesis (cbi-cob) may have been acquired via horizontal gene in response to environmental evolutionary adaptation. Genes for anaerobic metabolism of glycerol are located in the dihydroxyacetone (dha) regulon, whereas genes for the anaerobic degradation of propanediol are part of the pdu operon.41 The dehydratases of L. collinoides and L. brevis are general diol dehydratases (EC 4.2.1.28) rather than glycerol-specific dehydratases,56 but the dehydratase of L. reuteri has a higher affinity for glycerol than for propanediol,42 thus making it more efficient for conversion of glycerol to reuterin. The gene products of the homologues of pduCDE might determine properties of the pdu-cbi-cob gene cluster, and this cluster including gupCDE might provide a selective advantage to L. reuteri. Given the positive attributes of this phenotype, the pdu-cbi-cob-hem gene cluster might contribute to the probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria. Genomic islands involved in pathogenesis or symbiosis are believed to be significant in the evolution of different bacterial species. In this study, the L. reuteri genome has a genomic island that may be important in the evolution of L. reuteri strains as health promoting bacteria in the human gut.FundingThis research was supported by the ‘Academic Frontier’ Project for Private Universities: Matching Fund Subsidy, 2002-2006 (Azabu University), the Grants-in-Aid of Scientific Research (C) (18580275), Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas “Comprehensive Genomics” (17020007), and Grant-in-Aid for Encouragement of Young Scientists (B) (17710191) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.

The remaining variable genes are distributed throughout the H. pylori genome and some of them have been individualized in clusters of instability concerning blocks of 5–8 coding DNA sequences (CDSs).5,8,9Subtractive hybridization is a powerful tool for comparative prokaryotic genomics and was validated on H. pylori by several authors.10,11 In a previous study, we used subtractive hybridization to compare the genetic content of one H. pylori strain isolated from a gastric MALT lymphoma strain (strain B34) and one chronic gastritis only strain.12 One original 1092 bp sequence was identified, with no significant nucleotide similarity in comparison to the H. pylori reference strains 26695 and J99 genomes which were available. The aim of the present study was to localize this sequence in the H. pylori genome, to determine its prevalence, and to analyze its genetic diversity in H. pylori.Using an in-house genome walking method as previously described,13 the original region was localized in the H. pylori genome and a new CDS was subsequently identified using the CDS finder website (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gCDS/CDSig.cgi). This new CDS, called CDS2, is located between two CDS homologous to JHP1069/HP1141 and JHP1071/HP1143 according to the numbering of the J99 and 26695 reference strains, respectively.1,3 CDS2 replaced JHP1070/HP1142, called CDS1, in H. pylori reference strains J99 and 26695.The percentage of identity between the nucleotide sequences of CDS1 and CDS2 was determined using the LALIGN software,14 which identifies multiple matching subsegments in two sequences (http://www.ch.embnet.org/software/LALIGN_form.html). CDS2 showed 54.9% identity in a 2046 nucleotides overlap with JHP1070 and 55.5% identity in a 2083 nucleotides overlap with HP1142. CDS2 encodes a putative polypeptide of 820 residues (Genbank accesion number EF492441, EMBL Nucleotide Sequence AM902682). Regarding the protein homology, CDS2 shared 23.6% identity with JHP1070 in a 628 amino acid overlap and 24.4% identity with HP1142 in a 630 amino acid overlap. Finally, a strong nucleotide identity was found with the HPAG1_1080 sequence4 with 89.3% identity in a 2469 nucleotides overlap.The prevalence and the genetic diversity of the identified genomic locus were first determined for 24 H. pylori strains: 13 H. pylori strains isolated from gastric MALT lymphoma patients obtained from two multicentre French protocols and 11 strains isolated from French chronic gastritis only patients, as previously described12,15 by PCR amplification using primers hybridizing to the conserved sequence of the flanking genes (JHP1069/HP1141 and JHP1071/HP1143) according to the numbering of the J99 and 26695 strains, respectively. The primers were designed using the web Primer3 software (http://www.broad.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer/primer3_www.cgi).16 Direct sequencing was carried out on both strands, and nucleotide and deduced protein sequences were compared with the NCBI Blast program (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/). A CDS was always present at this locus: CDS1 was found in 54% of the strains, CDS2 in 29% of the strains, and an additional CDS, called CDS3, was identified in 17% of the strains. In the chronic gastritis only H. pylori strain G2, CDS3 had a 53.4% identity in a 2005 nucleotide overlap with CDS1 and a 52.9% identity in a 2063 nucleotides overlap with CDS2, and it encodes a putative polypeptide of 861 residues (GenBank accesion number EF492442, EMBL Nucleotide Sequence AM902683). CDS3 still has no counterpart in databases. Considering the three CDSs, no significant association with a virulence factor was found, nor with a pathology (data not shown). The presence or absence of these CDSs was also verified by dot blot hybridization, as previously described.12 It showed that the presence of one of these three CDSs was exclusive (no local duplication, data not shown).We first focused on the role of the genes present around the polymorphic locus. According to the revised annotation of the H. pylori genome,17 JHP1069/HP1141 encodes a methionyl-tRNA formyltransferase (fmt) and JHP1071/HP1143, a conserved hypothetical protein. fmt is considered to be an essential gene which links general metabolism with the translation process (protein biosynthesis).18,19 As shown in Fig. 1, JHP1069/HP1141 and JHP1071/HP1143 are surrounded by genes of hypothetical function. Considering the G + C% content of the region, all of the CDSs contained a G + C% similar to the rest of the H. pylori genome (∼39%) except for these variable regions: CDS1, CDS2, and CDS3 had 29, 30, and 31% G + C% content, respectively. The lower G + C% content suggests an external origin of these CDSs or a rapid adaptation.20 Indeed, Saunders et al.21, using a tetranucleotide and hexanucleotide signature analysis, identified substantial differences between JHP1070 and HP1142 genes and hypothesized that they were horizontally transferred.Representation of the genomic area of interest, according to the genome sequences of the two Helicobacter pylori reference strains J99 and 26695, which contain the variable CDS identified in the present study.

It codes for a putative polypeptide of 759 residues. Using a Blastp search, significant homologies were found with (i) Rlo proteins (R-linked ORF) from Campylobacter (e.g. RloG, E = e-11 in Campylobacter jejuni strain RM1167, or RloC, E = 7e-13 in C. jejuni strain RM11221),22,23 (ii) an ATP/GTP binding-site (GXXXXGKT), and (iii) a putative phage murein transglycosylase YomI (SPbeta phage protein; lytic transglycosylase, E = 4.52e-05 in Bacillus subtilis).24 The same significant homologies with Rlo and YomI were also found in CDS2 and CDS3. Finally, another interesting point to consider is that the three CDSs shared significant homology with chromosome partition protein SMC: for example, Treponema denticola ATCC 35405 chromosome NC_002967 E = 1.11e-11 for CDS1, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum ATCC 25586 E = 8.66e-10 for CDS2, Fusobacterium nucleatum subsp. nucleatum ATCC 25586 E = 3.86e-08 for CDS3.25 We did not find any significant motifs indicating that the proteins could be secreted and/or present in the membrane, but this does not preclude an association with the membrane via interaction with an integral membrane protein partner.How can one explain the apparent variability of the locus identified in the present study? One potential hypothesis is that the region is a hot spot for gene insertion/deletion, with a specific selection pressure maintaining a particular function at that precise location in the genome. Suerbaum and Josenhans26 recently reviewed the current data on the genetic diversity of H. pylori and argued that this bacterium uses mutation and recombination processes to adapt to its individual host by modifying molecules that interact with the host.26 Because the three CDSs retain the same similarities, it is likely that (i) these proteins share the same function or (ii) the gene is submitted to specific selection pressure making it evolve at a very rapid rate. We proposed that such a protein could be a phage receptor/translocator or that it could allow the DNA phage to enter host cells by remodelling the cell wall.27–29 Indeed, as already described in Escherichia coli, this kind of protein is subjected to a strong positive selection.30Helicobacter pylori genotypes vary markedly with their geographical region, and this is particularly the case for genes under positive selection. Therefore, the corresponding genes were looked for in three East Asian strains and three African strains. All three CDS were found: CDS1 was found in one Asian (strain 8038) and one African strain (strain TALLAN), CDS2 in two Asian strains (strains 12001 and strain 8033), and CDS3 in one Asian (strain 19A) and one African strain (strain BAPOOI) (Fig. 2). A phylogenetic analysis was conducted on the deduced amino acid sequences of CDS. Phylogenetic and molecular evolutionary analyses were conducted using MEGA version 4.31 Phylogenetic trees were generated by the neighbour-joining method.32 Molecular distances were determined using the Kimura two-parameter model.33 The tree showed three independent clusters which were clearly separated and corresponded to CDS1, CDS2, and CDS3, respectively (Fig. 2). However, the exact organization of these different CDS cannot be determined since this consensus tree cannot be rooted to other species. Indeed, no CDS with significant homology has ever been found in other species (in databases). Interestingly, even though the testing was performed on a limited number of non-European strains, these results indicate that the presence of one of the three CDS cannot be restricted to the geographical origin of the strains.Phylogenetic analysis of CDS, CDS1, CDS2, and CDS3, proteins generated with the neighbour-joining method.

Bootstrap confidence levels were determined by randomly resampling the sequencing data 1000 times. The results are indicated for each CDS in Table 1. Since Ka/Ks was <1 for the three CDSs analyzed, the purifying selection hypothesis was tested and the significant P-value obtained supports the hypothesis of conservation at the protein level for each CDS (Z-test P < 0.001).Analysis of molecular distances and synonymous and non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions within CDSs, CDS1 (n = 4), CDS2 (n = 4), and CDS3 (n = 3), in different Helicobacter pylori strainsnt, nucleotides; Ks, synonymous substitutions; Ka, non-synonymous substitutions.†P Z-Test < 0.001 for purifying selection hypothesis (Ka/Ks < 1).&Value ± standard error.The GenBank accession numbers of the sequences used in this study are listed in Fig. 2.Analysis of molecular distances and synonymous and non-synonymous nucleotide substitutions within CDSs, CDS1 (n = 4), CDS2 (n = 4), and CDS3 (n = 3), in different Helicobacter pylori strainsnt, nucleotides; Ks, synonymous substitutions; Ka, non-synonymous substitutions.†P Z-Test < 0.001 for purifying selection hypothesis (Ka/Ks < 1).&Value ± standard error.The GenBank accession numbers of the sequences used in this study are listed in Fig. 2.Finally, we propose that the very high variation observed in the protein sequences reflects the permanent selection pressure exerted by phages or other elements interacting with the organism's cell envelope. If this is the case, this locus could be used as a marker for constraints operating in the environmental niches in which particular H. pylori strains evolve. The presence of phages in H. pylori has been rarely described.37 For example, Marsich et al.38 postulated that H. pylori lysozyme gene (lys) had a prophage origin. Numerous other explanations cannot be excluded, such as bacterial mammalian host interaction, protozoan predation, or porin specificity. Indeed several publications have focused on cases of genes that vary markedly among H. pylori isolates. One example is the replacement of babA by babB as reported by Solnick et al.39Helicobacter pylori BabA is the ABO blood group antigen binding adhesin, which has a closely related paralogue (BabB) whose function is unknown. An extensive genotypic diversity in babA and babB across different strains, as well as within a strain colonizing an individual patient has been shown in line with the hypothesis that diverse profiles of babA and babB reflect selective pressures for adherence, which may differ across different hosts and within an individual over time.40In summary, a novel polymorphic locus comprised of a single gene was identified in the H. pylori genome. Although this variation could be explained by isotopic gene replacement via horizontal transfer of a gene with the same function but coming from a variety of sources, it seems more likely that the very high sequence variation observed at this locus is the result of a strong selection pressure exerted on the corresponding gene product. We propose that the evolution of CDS1, CDS2, and CDS3 is due to the occurrence of a specific environmental event, such as interaction with a biological structure, e.g. bacteriophage which are involved in surface cell secretion. The genes identified in the present study could be used as strain specific markers for particular niches. The predicted function of the gene products, although highly speculative, should encourage investigators to explore the presence of phages in the H. pylori environment and study their relationship regarding pathogenicity.The authors want to thank Dr Monica Oleastro from the Departamento de Doenças Infecciosas of the Instituto Nacional Saúde Dr Ricardo Jorge (Lisbon, Portugal) for the comparison of non-synonymous substitutions and synonymous substitutions among the three CDSs described in this study and Dr Jorge M.

Identification of replication origin in a genome is important not only in understanding the mechanisms of DNA replication but also in gaining insights into the structure and function of the genome. In bacteria, chromosome replication initiates at a single chromosome locus, called the replication origin (oriC), from which replication proceeds bidirectionally to the terminus. At the beginning of replication, ATP binds DnaA, resulting in a large oligomeric complex consisting of DnaA monomers bound to a series of 9-mer consensus elements termed DnaA boxes.1 Typical bacterial oriCs have many conserved sequence features, including (i) having single oriC in an intergenic region, (ii) having asymmetrical nucleotide distributions around oriCs, (iii) sequence between oriC and terminus being about half in length of the entire chromosome, (iv) containing multiple copies of DnaA boxes, (v) close to replication related genes, such as dnaA or dnaN, and (vi) containing repeat sequences.The genome of Sorangium cellulosum has recently been completely sequenced.2 In their report, Schneiker et al.2 concluded that ‘In the absence of the GC-skew inversion typically seen at the replication origin of bacterial chromosomes, it was not possible to discern the location of oriC’. Additionally, we also note that the complete genome of Microcystis aeruginosa NIES-843 has been determined recently.3 Kaneko et al. concluded that ‘there was no characteristic pattern, according to GC skew analysis’.3 Therefore, oriC locations of the above genomes remain unsolved.To identify oriC regions of unannotated bacterial genomes, we recently developed an online tool, Ori-Finder, based on an integrated method comprising de novo gene identification, the Z-curve method,4 distribution of DnaA boxes, occurrence of gene frequently close to oriCs and phylogenetic relationships.5Using this software, in the genome of S. cellulosum, we have identified an oriC, which is within an intergenic region between a kinase gene (sce8163) and the dnaN gene, rather than the dnaA gene, from 11 354 923 to 11 355 551 nt of the genome. Around this oriC, there are clear asymmetrical base distributions of A/T, G/C, M/K, and R/Y (Fig. 1A). The DnaA box motif is TTATCCCCC, probably due to the high genomic GC content (71.4%), rather than TTATCCACA, the DnaA box motif of E. coli. The dif-like sequence (GGATCGCATAAGAAACATTATGTCAACT) has been found between 5 024 594 and 5 024 621 nt, which matches 20 sites compared with the 28-nt E. coli dif sequence (GGTGCGCATAATGTATATTATGTTAAAT), which is usually present in replication termini. Consequently, the sequence lengths between the predicted oriC and dif-like sequence are about 6 331 kb (48.6%) and 6 703 kb (51.4%), each of which is equal roughly to half of the genome size. The oriC regions usually contain multiple copies of repeat sequences, which are generally believed to facilitate the binding of the complex of enzymes to these DNA sequences.6 In the oriC of S. cellulosum, we found four copies of perfect reverse repeats using the software REPuter7 (Fig. 1B). Therefore, it is very likely that the intergenic region between sce8163 and dnaN genes, which has almost all the hallmarks of a bacterial oriC, is the replication origin of S. cellulosum. Note that the asymmetrical nucleotide distribution around oriC region of S. cellulosum can also be discerned by performing the cumulative GC skew analysis.(A) AT, GC, RY, and MK disparity curves for the rotated S. cellulosum genome sequence beginning and ending in the dif site. The locations of dnaA, dnaN, oriC, and the dif site are indicated by arrows. (B) Schematic diagram of the replication origin of S. cellulosum. The oriC is located in the intergenic region between a kinase gene (ID: sce8163) and the dnaN gene, from 11 354 923 to 11 355 551 nt of the genome. Within this region, there are four copies of perfect reverse repeats (red) and three DnaA boxes (yellow).(A) AT, GC, RY, and MK disparity curves for the rotated S. cellulosum genome sequence beginning and ending in the dif site.

The oriC is within an intergenic region between the dnaN and the hemL genes, from 3 542 737 to 3 543 291 nt of the genome. The DnaA box motif is TTTTCCACA rather than TTATCCACA. The features that the ‘species-specific’ DnaA box is TTTTCCACA, and oriC is adjacent to the dnaN gene are universal for the bacteria of the phylum Cyanobacteria, such as Prochlorococcus marinus, Synechococcus, etc. For more details, visit DoriC, a database of oriC regions in bacterial genomes,8 which is available at http://tubic.tju.edu.cn/doric/. In the oriC of M. aeruginosa, we also found two copies of perfect palindromic repeats using the software REPuter (Fig. 2). Therefore, it is very likely that the intergenic region between the dnaN and the hemL genes, which has common oriC features among the bacteria of the phylum Cyanobacteria, is the replication origin of M. aeruginosa.Schematic diagram of the replication origin of M. aeruginosa.

Genomic analysis in concert with traditional knowledge and technology will continue to be powerful tools in the future exploration of A. oryzae.1. Historical backgroundsAspergillus oryzae is a fungus widely used in traditional Japanese fermentation industries, including soy sauce, sake, bean curd seasoning and vinegar production. Filamentous fungi generally have the ability to produce various and vast amounts of enzymes in a secretory manner. Among filamentous fungi, A. oryzae is known to have prominent potential for the secretory production of various enzymes. In addition, developments in genetic engineering technology have led to the application of A. oryzae in the production of industrial enzymes in modern biotechnology. Aspergillusoryzae was used for the first example of commercial production of heterogonous enzyme, the lipase for laundry detergent in 1988.11.1. Solid-state cultivationOne of the distinctive features of the use of A. oryzae in traditional Japanese fermentation is the use of solid-state cultivation (SSC) (rice grain, soybean and wheat bran). This style of fermentation is thought to have originated 3000–2000 years ago in China.2,3 The technology was imported into Japan during the Yayoi period (B.C. 10th–A.D. 3rd).2 Inocula from filamentous fungi for fermentation have been commercially available as koji since the 13–15th century (Heian and Muromachi period).4 This indicates that koji was cultivated without the knowledge that it is composed of a microorganism. Thus, the word, koji, indicates both the material fermented by A. oryzae in the form of SSC and the A. oryzae microorganism itself (koji mold). A key technology enabling the industrial production and distribution of A. oryzae was the production of conidiospores whilst keeping them alive and uncontaminated. Traditionally, this technology involved the use of hardwood leaves burned to white ashes in poor aeration. The conidiospores packed in paper bags were layered with the ashes between them in a box and stored. The technology was indispensable to the avoidance of contamination by other microorganisms in a period when desiccant or air conditioning was unavailable.4 This technology led to the discovery that leaf ashes added to steamed rice also allowed reliable production of conidiospores. Conidiospores prepared industrially for sake brewing are called Moyashi. Signboards with three Japanese characters, ‘moyashi’ (or fermentation starter), indicate the supplier of A. oryzae conidiospores for sake brewers (Fig. 1). It is currently known that alkaline pH, produced by the addition of the ash, prevents contamination by other microorganisms and that minerals contained with the ash enhance the formation of conidiospores.2,4,5 This technology has been applied to the production of Trichoderma spores as a biological pesticide by Akita Konno Co., Ltd, a biotech company whose origins stem from the traditional fermentation industry.A historical signboard of a producer of A. oryzae conidiospores. Aspergillus oryzae conidiospores are industrially produced and are distributed to fermentation companies. Two suppliers were established ∼600 years ago (Muromachi period). No other suppliers were established before A.D. 17–18th. The figure shows a photograph of an original signboard, Kuro-ban (black stamp), prepared under the license of Koji-za, the association of A. oryzae conidiospores suppliers during the Muromachi period. Currently there are five major distributors in Japan supplying A. oryzae conidiospores to 4500 sake (Japanese alcoholic beverage, ca. 1900 brewers), miso (soybean paste, ca. 1200 brewers) and shoyu (soy sauce, ca. 1500 brewers) brewers in Japan, excluding several of the biggest soy-sauce companies. The three characters called Hiragana, which were originally developed in Japan; on the signboard have pronunciations, “mo”, “ya” and “shi” from top to bottom. Moyashi means the A. oryzae conidiospores used mainly by sake brewers.A historical signboard of a producer of A. oryzae conidiospores.

Moyashi means the A. oryzae conidiospores used mainly by sake brewers.The ability of secretory production of proteins is further enhanced in solid-state culture compared with submerged culture. For example, A. oryzae can produce ∼50 g of α-amylase from 1 kg of wheat bran, which is roughly equivalent to 1 L of liquid culture medium. The first example of the industrial application of SSC to enzyme production by A. oryzae was Taka-diastase, developed as a stomach medicine by Jokichi Takamine in 1894. Recently, solid-state fermentation systems using the industrial fungi A. oryzae and A. sojae have been introduced for the production of various industrial enzymes (cf. amylases, proteases, lipases) and speciality chemicals.6 In spite of the extensive use of SSC, much less is known about SSC than for submerged cultivation, which is widely used in modern biotechnology owing to its easier automatic handling. Gene expression analysis revealed important factors affecting secretion of enzymes in SSC, physical barrier and low water activity.7 Recently, practical approaches to liquid cultivation containing solid materials succeeded in the effective production of enzymes in a secretory manner allowing the degradation of raw materials with a similar efficiency to SSC.8 Analysis of the mechanism for the secretory production of enzymes in SSC may be important to the understanding of highly efficient secretion.1.2. Isolation and identification of A. oryzaeSequencing the genome of A. oryzae RIB40 (ATCC-42149) was completed in 2005.9 The sequenced strain is a wild-type strain, most similar to those used for sake brewing but still has the ability of strong production of proteases, which is one of the most important characteristics for soy-sauce fermentation. Aspergillusoryzae was first isolated from koji by H. Ahlburg in 1876 when he was invited to the Japanese Medical College. Its original name, Eurotium oryzae, was later renamed A. oryzae by F. Cohn because he found that it lacked the ability of sexual reproduction. It is said that A. oryzae is a domesticated species and, therefore, that A. oryzae may be found only in a domesticated form but not in nature. On the other hand, it has been stated, in a historical literature, that koji should be isolated from the mold growing on an ear of rice. Some reports about the isolation of A. oryzae from soil, plants and food10 support the natural isolation of A. oryzae for fermentation. However, these species might now be distributed in nature following domestication many years ago.There are two scenarios to be considered for the origination of koji fermentation. In the first scenario, A. oryzae may have been isolated from nature independently in Japan. A literature describing naturally fermented alcoholic beverage was found in a historical document, Harima no Kuni Fudoki, edited in AD 715.2 Another historical document described that koji must be isolated from the mold growing on an ear of rice. This means that A. oryzae may have existed in nature before domestication and might be isolated from other dangerous species such as A. flavus through the method indicated in the historical literatures above. In the second scenario, A. oryzae may have been imported from China during the Yayoi period. The material used for the fermentation in East Asia was a block of hardened raw wheat or rice powder. The filamentous fungi that grew on the block is thought to have been Mucor or Rhizopus.2 On the other hand, the material used in the production of Japanese alcoholic beverage was steamed rice grain, thus, proteinous components in rice are considerably denatured. Mucor and Rhizopus, which have a low productivity of proteases allowing the assimilation of denatured proteins as nitrogen sources, grow poorly on steamed rice. On the contrary, A. oryzae, producing a considerable amount of proteases, could predominantly grow in an environment where a mixture of spores of these heterologous species exists. The names of the traditional fermented materials, which indicate yellow color, but not dark gray as Mucor and Rhizopus, also suggests that A. oryzae was first used in Japanese fermentation industries. Therefore, the second scenario may not be well supported.1.3. SafetyThe long history of extensive use of A. oryzae in food fermentation industries prompted industrial applications of A. oryzae to be listed as Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the USA.11,12 The safety of this organism is also supported by World Health Organization (WHO).13 Although A. oryzae is genetically very close to A. flavus, which is known to produce the most potent natural carcinogen, aflatoxin, A. oryzae has no record of producing aflatoxin or any other carcinogenic metabolites.14 Fermented foods produced by A. oryzae including A. sojae, the close relative to A. oryzae in section Flavi, have been shown to be aflatoxin free.15,16 The two species, A. oryzae and A. flavus were traditionally distinguished based on morphological, physiological and culture-based characteristics.17 Recent DNA-based techniques have enhanced the potential for distinction.18–20 Zhang et al. reported that homologs of aflatoxin biosynthesis gene cluster of A. oryzae were not expressed even under the conditions that are favorable to aflatoxin expression in A. flavus and A. parasiticus.21We have received huge benefits from A. oryzae for thousands of years and may continue to receive them in the future. At the same time, we are facing various mysteries regarding A. oryzae: unique cultivation method, species origin, isolation and so forth, as described above. In spite of economical importance and scientific interest, the fact that A. oryzae forms multinucleate conidia and lacks a sexual life cycle have prevented extensive basic studies by conventional approaches. It is very interesting to see whether and to what extent genomics elucidates the subjects concerning ancestor, molecular mechanism for high secretion and safety, and the potential of A. oryzae in new fields where A. oryzae has never yet been applied.2. Lessons from genomicsThe A. oryzae genome consists of eight chromosomes with an entire genome size of 37.6 Mb (Fig. 2). Comparison of the A. oryzae genome with two other Aspergilli sp., A. nidulans and A. fumigatus, sequenced in the similar timelines revealed that A. oryzae had a 25–30% bigger genome size than the other two species.9 Accordingly, A. Oryzae had 2000–3000 more genes than the other two species, indicating similar gene densities of the three species. The increase of gene number, in accordance with the increase of genome size, mainly derived from the gene expansion of metabolic genes. This includes secretory hydrolases, transporters and primary and secondary metabolism genes, among which the expansion of secondary metabolism genes is most prominent9 (see another review22 for detail). Aspergillusoryzae is known to have a wide variety of hydrolytic enzymes and a strong capacity for degrading various materials. The gene expansion of secretory hydrolases explains these abilities well. The multiple transporters may be used for efficient degradation or further conversion of degraded materials, but their main role may be to excrete toxic compounds for A. oryzae to grow. In fermentation, A. oryzae is exposed to vast amounts and high concentrations of compounds derived from a single material, rice, soybean, wheat, etc., which may include phytoalexin or other compounds that inhibit growth. The unusual environment that was artificially introduced might allow A. oryzae to acquire additional transporters.Contigs and NSBs/SBs maps Contigs (SCnnn; n, decadecimal number) and NSBs (black bars) are mapped on the A. oryzae chromosomes.9 Arrows and values in parentheses indicate direction and length of the contigs in mega base, respectively. Adapted from Machida et al.9Contigs and NSBs/SBs maps Contigs (SCnnn; n, decadecimal number) and NSBs (black bars) are mapped on the A. oryzae chromosomes.9 Arrows and values in parentheses indicate direction and length of the contigs in mega base, respectively. Adapted from Machida et al.92.1. Insights into the molecular mechanism of safetyInterestingly, the expanded genes indicated above were highly enriched on the non-syntenic blocks (NSBs) that were determined by the comparison of gene orders on the genomes between A. oryzae and A. nidulans or A. fumigatus. The NSBs were distributed through the entire A. oryzae genome in a mosaic manner. The expressed sequence tag (EST) analysis23 showed that the transcriptional expression of the NSB genes was considerably weaker than the genes on syntenic blocks (SBs) (P = 4.1 × 10−134).9 The difference of absolute levels of the gene expression between the two blocks was confirmed by DNA microarray.24 Therefore, the secondary metabolism genes, which are highly enriched on NSBs, are not expressed in the culture conditions examined including SSC. Consequently, the EST analysis showed a striking contrast in expression of the aflatoxin biosynthesis gene homologs; whereas ESTs for all the 25 gene homologs25 were found in A. flavus.26 No ESTs except for aflJ and norA were found in A. oryzae.23 These results suggest that the long history of industrial use of A. oryzae has removed genes unfavorable for human consumption. Alternatively, A. oryzae, by some means, might have been selected as a safe mutant from the beginning. Another industrial species, A. sojae, which is genetically very close to A. parasiticus, the aflatoxin producer, lacks the ability to produce aflatoxin, and so is similar to A. oryzae, although it harbors aflatoxin gene cluster homologs.27 One of the possible reasons explaining the inability of the expression of the aflatoxin biosynthesis gene homologs in the two species is mutation of the aflR gene. However, Takahashi et al. showed that complementation of the mutated A. sojae aflR gene (truncation by nonsense mutation) was insufficient for the expression of aflatoxin cluster homologs.27 Further, base substitutions in the two elemental sequences (AreA and FacB binding sites) in the A. oryzae aflR promoter alone do not seem to be key for the absence of aflR mRNA.28 These results suggest a silencing mechanism similar to that observed in the regulation of aflatoxin biosynthesis gene homologs in A. sojae.15,27,28 Recently, a global regulator of secondary metabolism genes, laeA,29 was found. The fact that the predicted laeA gene seems intact in A. oryzae may suggest the existence of a global regulation mechanism of secondary metabolism by other transcriptional regulatory factor(s). Greater than 40% of the A. oryzae strains deposited in the National Research Institute of Brewing lack more than half of the entire cluster of aflatoxin biosynthesis gene homologs (Group 2 and other strains), but the remaining strains have the near intact cluster (Group 1 strains).30 It is thought that the latter strains have at least double or more safety locks preventing induction of aflatoxin biosynthesis gene homologs outside the cluster.2.2. Secrets of solid-state fermentationTranscriptome analysis using cDNA microarray revealed that the carbohydrate metabolism showed typical characteristics of gluconeogenesis in SSC in spite of the presence of rich nutrients in koji culture.31 The lower expression levels of catabolic genes of the glycolytic pathway and the tricarboxylic acid cycle in solid-state culture led to a release from catabolite repression, and consequently to high-level expression of hydrolytic enzymes. Low water activity may cause inefficient degradation and uptake of nutrients resulting in starvation.Recently, the expression regulation of the NSB genes were analyzed by DNA microarray comprised more than 11 000 oligonucleotide probes of the A. oryzae genes. The significantly lower expression level of the NSB genes when compared with the SB genes in an average was confirmed by the DNA microarray experiments (Fig. 3A). Besides the difference in absolute expression levels between NSBs and SBs, the expression regulation showed striking difference between the two blocks.24 The genes on NSBs were significantly repressed at heat shock (42°C), whereas those on SBs were induced in an average. Interestingly, the genes on NSBs appeared globally up-regulated in SSC, but those on SBs did not display global characteristics of up- or down-regulation under the same conditions (Fig. 3B).24 High induction ratios of the genes encoding extracellular enzymes, which belong to the metabolism of the COG meta-category, contributed most to the global induction of the NSB genes. In contrast, the global up-regulation of the SB genes at heat shock was mainly due to the induction of the genes belonging to the meta-category of Information Storage and Processing. The two meta-categories played an important role for the characteristic global up-regulation of the genes on each block showed obviously bigger occupation in comparison between the two blocks. Furthermore, the NSB genes that did not have genes with sequence similarity to the genes on SBs showed higher induction ratios on average compared with those from the NSB genes that had homologs on SBs. Therefore, the genes that had similarity between the two blocks after the removal of the genes specific in each block showed global expression profiles which are more similar than using entire genes on each block.24Characteristic transcriptional expression of the genes on NSBs and SBs.

See further details in the previous reports. Reproduced from Tamano et al., 2008.24Hydrolases occupied a major part of the genes highly induced in two SSC (9 out of the top 29 induced NSB genes and 10 out of the top 47 induced SB genes). The genes include those encoding hydrolases [cf. leucine aminopeptidase (Chien et al., 2002)32 and neutral protease II (Tatsumi et al., 1991)]33 on NSBs and alkaline protease (Murakami et al., 1991)34, glucoamylase (Hata et al., 1998)35 on SBs, which play an important role in the degradation of proteins and starch in the raw materials for fermentation. Another notable feature of the highly induced genes in SSC is the high abundance of transporters in the major facilitator superfamily (MFS). These transporters might be necessary for the growth in vast amounts of the limited variety of raw materials, where trace amounts of toxic materials in the raw materials might be condensed. As mentioned above, the transcriptional level of the NSB genes are significantly lower than the SB genes. However, some NSB genes, neutral protease (AO090103000310) and MFS transporter (AO090010000493) genes, for example, showed an expression strength comparable to alkaline protease (AO090003001036) and translation elongation factor (AO090120000080), which showed the highest expression levels among the SB genes (∼4 sigma bigger than the average of entire genes). Thus, the genes above may make a large contribution to the degradation of raw materials. The bigger induction ratios of the genes specific to NSBs suggest that the products of these genes might be important to the effective degradation of the raw materials through breaking minor chemical linkage, which loosen the conformation of polymers for example. During solid-state fermentation, the materials with A. oryzae growing on their surface are mixed upside down for a while. This process, which is called Teire, is necessary to keep the temperature below ∼40°C and to improve aeration during fermentation while A. oryzae is growing vigorously. The results of the expression analysis above suggest that this process is important in preventing the A. oryzae-specific homologs of various hydrolases on NSBs from being repressed by temperature increase.Interestingly, no genes encoding polyketide synthase (PKS) or non-ribosomal peptide synthetase (NRPS) (Cramer et al., 2006)36 on NSBs were induced in SSC, although on average the NSB genes were highly induced. Similarly, of the SB genes, no genes encoding PKS and NRPS were induced except one PKS gene (AO090701000530). In contrast, the genes encoding hydrolases and transporters, which were highly enriched on NSBs as well, were induced as described above.24 This indicates that the expression profiles of the NSB genes are classified into at least two groups and might suggest the mechanism of gene regulation of A. oryzae in acquiring a high potential for degrading raw materials with a high level of safety. Aspergilli possess more sensor histidine kinases (13–15) than yeast (1–3), whereas the numbers of histidine-containing phosphotransfer factors and response regulators are basically the same. Aspergilli have HK8 histidine kinase family, which is absent in other sequenced filamentous fungi belonging to Sordariomycetes and Dothideomycetes.9 Further, A. oryzae generally has greater numbers of HK6, MAPK, MAPKK and MAPKKK than other filamentous fungi.9 The complex signal transduction cascade may be necessary in order to regulate genes expanded in the A. oryzae genome and may acquire the ability to adapt various growth conditions.The genes specifically expressed in SSC have been cloned and sequenced by preparing the subtracted cDNA library in which the genes specific to SSC were enriched. Approximately half of the genes expressed specifically in SSC encoded secretory or intracellular enzymes and transporter proteins. Most of the remaining genes were functionally unknown.23,37 Recent proteomic analysis showed that A. oryzae produced a much larger amount of total proteins in SSC (wheat bran) than in submerged cultivation (wheat bran suspension supplemented with ammonium sulfate and phosphate) although more variety of secreted proteins over 50 kDa was produced in submerged culture than in solid-state culture.38 Secretion of a large amount of enzymes was thought to be necessary in order to obtain nutrients under the low water activity. More than half of the entire amount of the visible proteins in the 2D gel electrophoresis is α-amylases and their proteolytic products.Interestingly, A. oryzae mycelia grown on a nylon membrane placed over a Czapek–Dox medium plate showed significant induction of the alternative glucoamylase gene, glaB, which is known to be one of the typical genes specific to SSC. Small pore size (0.2 µm) of the membrane and high concentration of maltose (50%) in the medium were important for strong induction.39 Environmental factors responsible for transcriptional induction specific to SSC are thought to have low water activity, low diffusion of nutrients and gases, continuity of medium distribution and physical barriers for hyphal extension.39–41 This method is very useful because of its SSC-like conditions and mycelia can be much more easily prepared than native SSC.2.3. Genome evolution of A. oryzaeThe comparison of three Aspergillus spp. genomes from spp. A. oryzae, A. nidulans and A. fumigatus revealed expansion of genes and genome size. The expansion reached ∼20% of the A. oryzae genome. At least two scenarios must be taken into consideration accounting for the mechanism of the expansion; (i) the ancestor might have a small genome size similar to A. nidulans and A. fumigatus, and might have acquired genetic materials to make the A. oryzae genome bigger, (ii) the ancestor might have a genome size similar to A. oryzae, and the other two species might have lost their genes (Fig. 4A and B). Phylogenomic analysis of the three species revealed that A. nidulans branched off earlier than speciation of A. oryzae and A. fumigatus.42 Therefore, if A. nidulans and A. fumigatus lost their genes as in the second scenario, they have lost the genes independently after speciation. However, considering that the gene organization between the two species seems very similar as shown by the synteny map of the two species and that the number of genes lost from the ancestor reaches nearly 20%,9 the second scenario is unlikely to be accepted. Mosaic distribution of phylogenetically anomalous genes on the chromosomes and apparently similar phylogenetic distances of the expanded genes to their homologs on SBs suggest a horizontal gene transfer (HGT) mechanism for the gene acquisition.9 Recently, Fedorova et al. proposed a gene duplication and divergence (GDD) mechanism43,44 for the acquisition of the A. fumigatus specific genes.45 Nearly half of the A. fumigatus specific genes with paralogs localized in the subtelomeric regions that occupied <20% of the entire genome. The result together with the significant decrease of gene size and intron number of the A. fumigatus specific genes strongly suggests the GDD scenario.45 This suggests that most of the A. oryzae expanded genes might have been acquired by this mechanism (Fig. 4C). Apparent localization of NSBs to the chromosomal ends (see Fig. 2) could support the idea. Nevertheless, there is a clear exception involving two A. oryzae specific genes clustered into the bacterial clades with the highest similarity to Agrobacterium tumefaciens genes (AGR_L_1864, AGR_L_1866).9 Large number of the extra genes in the A. oryzae genome might have been expanded by the combination of the two mechanisms, HGT and GDD.Possible mechanism of gene and genome size expansion of A. oryzae. (A) The common ancestor of the three Aspergillus species (A. oryzae, A. fumigatus and A. nidulans) is assumed to have smaller genome size of A. oryzae and similar size to A. fumigatus and A. nidulans. Aspergillusoryzae might have acquired genetic materials (represented by hatched boxes) during evolution. (B) The common ancestor is assumed to have the genome size similar to A. oryzae. The other two species might have lost genetic materials (represented by open boxes) during evolution. The phylogenetic relationship of the three species42 is indicated. (C) The A. oryzae genome size might have been expanded by the gene duplication followed by divergence of one of the duplicated genes (represented by hatched boxes).Possible mechanism of gene and genome size expansion of A. oryzae. (A) The common ancestor of the three Aspergillus species (A. oryzae, A. fumigatus and A. nidulans) is assumed to have smaller genome size of A. oryzae and similar size to A. fumigatus and A. nidulans.

(C) The A. oryzae genome size might have been expanded by the gene duplication followed by divergence of one of the duplicated genes (represented by hatched boxes).The most recent effort for sequencing the A. flavus genome has made it possible to analyze the history of its genome evolution and to evaluate the potential of cellular function of the two species by comparing the two genomes. Aspergillusflavus had genome size (36.8 Mb) and gene number (12 197) very similar to those of A. oryzae (36.7 Mb, 12 079, respectively). Surprisingly, the number of genes found uniquely in each genome was only ∼350 indicating that the genes of the two species are highly similar in terms of amino acid sequence and organizations.46,47 This clearly indicates that the expanded genes in A. oryzae existed from the beginning, i.e. before domestication. Detailed comparative analysis will shed light on the important and interesting subjects mentioned above. Aspergillusflavus, which utilizes nutrients from plants, may require redundant and various secretory hydrolases. During the long history of domestication, the ancestor of the two species lacked the ability to produce poisonous compounds, aflatoxin for example, and these enzymes might have been applied to effective degradation of raw materials during fermentation.2.4. Applied genomics of A. oryzaeGenomics has facilitated the application of A. oryzae to recycling of biodegradable plastic. Maeda et al.48 found that A. oryzae could grow with poly-(buthylene succinate) (PBS) as a sole carbon source by degrading it with cutinase, CutL1. They applied DNA microarray31 to investigate the additional factor(s) involved in efficient PBS degradation, and found that the rolA (rodA-like) gene was highly transcribed specifically in the presence of PBS.49 This mechanism appears to involve cutinase recruitment to a solid surface, dependent on the conformation of the RolA bound to the hydrophobic surface. Interestingly, they found that RolA bound to the solid PBS surface and specifically recruits CutL1 to the surface, which stimulated hydrolysis of PBS by CutL1.49 Specific interactions between RolA adsorbed on the hydrophobic surface, and CutL1 was confirmed by quartz crystal microbalance50 and immunostaining methods. The interaction dramatically facilitated the PBS degradation catalyzed by CutL1. Furthermore, they found that high levels of fluorescence recovery was observed after photobleaching51 of fluorescein isothiocyanate-labeled RolA, suggesting lateral mobility of RolA on the PBS surface.49 The mechanism could imply a novel tactic for fungal invasion of plants, insects and other animals. Without the genomic approach, RolA, which lacks enzymatic activity that can be measured by conventional biochemistry, could be hardly determined without consuming much time and labor.Recently, disruption of genes involved in the non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) pathway, ku70 and/or ku80, was found to enhance the gene targeting efficiency in Kluyveromyces lactis and Neurospora crassa.52,53 The novel finding was immediately applied to industrial filamentous fungi, A. oryzae and A. sojae.54 Namely, disruption of ku70 or ku80 enhanced targeting efficiency for A. oryzae from 10% to greater than 60%. However, the efficiency reproducibly was lower than that of ku-disruptants of K. lactis and N. crassa (nearly 100% for both) and suggests the existence of an unknown NHEJ pathway in A. oryzae and A. sojae.54 Nonetheless, the use of ku-disruptant has dramatically enhanced the performance of analyzing gene function by a systematic disruption approach. Most recently, deletion of DNA ligase IV (LigD), another factor involving the NHEJ pathway, resulted in a targeting efficiency as high as 100% in N. crassa and A. oryzae.55,56 The ligD mutant was successfully applied to a comprehensive gene disruption of MAP kinases in A. oryzae.Aspergillusoryzae and A. fumigatus were revealed to have over 200 genes implicated in the fungal mating process and an alpha and an HMG mating-type gene, respectively. This suggests that both species may be capable of sexual reproduction.42 The sequenced strain of A. fumigatus was found to have an HMG gene. A PCR-based study revealed the existence of A. fumigatus strains with the alpha mating-type gene.57 However, those genes were perfectly associated with vegetative (heterokaryon) compatibility groups (VCGs) among the strains examined, that is, the strains in the same VCG have a single mating-type gene (Natalie C. Fedrova, personal communication). Comparison of the genomes of A. oryzae and A. flavus, considering their close genetic relationship, should be of great interest in addressing the capability of sexual development of A. oryzae.The novel technology has been applied to the deletion of a large DNA region up to 200 kb.58 This allows the engineering of these species by completely deleting industrially undesirable genes to further improve productivity and safety. Recent technologies, high-resolution mass spectrometry and the next-generation DNA sequencers will further facilitate our understanding of the mechanism that produces various metabolites and will elucidate mutations indispensable for industrial use. To date sequencings of ∼50 fungal genomes have been completed or are near completion (see Table 1 for resources). Comparative genomics and functional genomics in combination with knowledge gained from traditional fermentation technologies should be extremely valuable as a means for both the basic and industrial research of A. oryzae.Internet resources for fungal genomicsInternet resources for fungal genomicsSupplementary DataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.The authors are grateful to Dr Yuichiro Murai of Kojiya Sanzaemon, Co., Ltd and Harunatsuakifuyu Sousyo for providing the photograph of the historical signboard.

IntroductionOrientia tsutsugamushi, a causative agent of scrub typhus or ‘Tsutsugamushi’ disease, is a Gram-negative bacterium belonging to the order Rickettsiales from the alpha-subdivision of Proteobacteria. The bacterium had been classified into the genus Rickettsia, but has recently been transferred to the genus Orientia, a genus newly created in the family Rickettsiaceae, based on the differences in the 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) sequence (Supplementary Fig. S1) and in several morphological and biochemical features.1Like other members of the order Rickettsiales, O. tsutsugamushi is an obligate intracellular parasite. In nature, the bacterium lives in trombiculid mites, which are called ‘tsutsugamushi’ in Japanese. In infected mites, the bacterium is found in the host cell cytosol of various organs including the oocytes, and is efficiently passed on to the offspring via transovarial transmission.2–6 Trombiculid mites suck the tissue fluid of mammals only once in their life cycle at the larval stage, when the bacterium is transferred to the animal to induce scrub typhus. Reverse transfer, from infected animals to mites, occurs inefficiently,7,8 and the bacterium transmitted in such a way is rarely passed on to the offspring.7–9 Accordingly, limited numbers of mite lines retain O. tsutsugamushi. However, O. tsutsugamushi or mites carrying this bacterium are widely distributed in Asia and the Western Pacific islands; one billion people are estimated to be at risk for scrub typhus, and one million cases occur annually.10In infected animals and humans, O. tsutsugamushi invades the macrophages and vascular endothelial cells, escapes from the phagosomes, and propagates in the cytosol like other Rickettsiaceae family members, inducing an acute febrile state. It often causes a deadly illness if not treated with appropriate antibiotics, but the molecular pathogenicity is still poorly understood and no vaccine is currently available.Orientia tsutsugamushi strains are serologically classified into several subgroups based on the antigenic variations of a major surface protein called ‘56-kDa protein’.11 The results of our pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis indicate that the genome size of O. tsutsugamushi is much larger than those of other members of the order Rickettsiales, and that the genome exhibits a significant strain-to-strain size variation, ranging from 2.0 to 2.7 Mb (Tamura et al., unpublished data). However, no known techniques for genetic manipulation are applicable to this bacterium, and only a few pieces of genetic information have so far been accumulated; only the DNA sequences of the genes for the 56-kDa protein from various serotypes have been intensively analyzed.12,13 In order to better understand the genetic features of this bacterium, we determined the complete genome sequence of O. tsutsugamushi strain Ikeda. Here, we present the genomic features of the microorganism revealed by genome sequence analysis of the strain Ikeda and genomic comparison with other sequenced members of the family Rickettsiacea. Some of our results obtained by genomic comparison of the strain Ikeda and other recently sequenced O. tsutsugamushi strain Boryong14 are also presented.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strainOrientia tsutsugamushi strain Ikeda was originally isolated from a patient in 1979 in Niigata Prefecture, Japan. The strain belongs to the Japanese Gilliam serotype and is highly virulent in mice.15 The mite vector of the strain was not identified, but Japanese Gilliam serotype strains are usually carried by Leptotrombidium pallidum or Leptotrombidium scutellare.12,15–18 The strain has been kept in the laboratory by repeated propagation on L929 cells and passages in mice since the initial isolation, which may have generated multiple sub-strains containing some genomic alterations. To avoid the usage of heterogeneous genomic DNA derived from such sub-strains for genome sequencing, we performed single plaque purification on L929 cells as previously described.19 The cloned strain was propagated in L929 cells, and bacterial cells were purified on a percoll gradient as described previously.202.2. DNA preparation and sequencingBacterial DNA was obtained from the purified cells by standard procedures.21 A single batch of DNA preparation was used for all the experiments described hereafter. The genomic DNA was randomly sheared by means of a Hydroshear (GeneMachines) and used for the construction of genomic libraries. We prepared two pUC18-based random genomic libraries with insert sizes of 1–1.5 or 4–5 kb. A BAC library with an insert size of 11–15 kb was also constructed using the pIndigoBAC-5 vector (Epicentre). Sequencing was carried out using the BigDye v3.1 chemistry on ABI370 or ABI3730 sequencers (ABI), or the ET chemistry on MegaBACE4500 sequencers (GE Healthcare).Because the genome sequence of O. tsutsugamushi was extremely rich in repetitive sequences, we employed a sequencing strategy comprising the following four steps. We first produced 32 000 shotgun reads from the 1–1.5 kb library and 14 000 reads from the 4–5 kb library using the forward sequencing primer. The Phred/Phrap software package22 was used for base-calling, quality assessment, and sequence assembly. The assemblies were visualized in order to count the base variations and detect misassembly using the Consed software.23 Based on the assembled data from 46 000 shotgun reads, we selected 6700 informative clones from both libraries, which were predicted to be located at the contig ends. The reverse end-sequences of these clones were determined using the reverse primer, and were assembled with the 46 000 forward sequences. The redundancy of the random shotgun sequences we obtained up to this stage was ∼13. At the third stage, the end sequences of 2383 BAC clones were determined, and 142 clones which were predicted to bridge the contigs were selected. These clones were individually sequenced and used as scaffolds in the sequence assembly. After re-assembly, 26 additional BAC clones were selected, sequenced individually, and added to the assembly. This assembly yielded 15 major contigs ranging in length from 20.4 to 296.0 kb. Finally, in order to close the 15 gaps, genomic PCR was carried out for five gaps using an LA long PCR kit (Takara), and 14 BAC clones were retrieved to close the remaining 10 gaps. The sequences of the five PCR products (3.7–25.4 kb) and the 14 BAC clones were individually determined. By adding these sequences to the assembly, we obtained the complete genome sequence of O. tsutsugamushi strain Ikeda.2. 3. Validation of the sequence assemblyTo validate the sequence assembly, we digested the chromosomal DNA of strain Ikeda with SmaI or EagI, or double-digested it with these two enzymes, and analyzed the digested DNA by PFGE as described previously.24 The digestion patterns we obtained were in good agreement with those deduced from the assembled sequence (Supplementary Fig. S2). In addition, we designed 18 pairs of PCR primers that amplified the 18-genomic segments that covered a 69-kb region of the chromosome (nucleotide positions: 611 095–670 870 bp) and performed a PCR scanning analysis.25 In this analysis, all primer pairs yielded PCR products of expected sizes (data not shown).2. 4. Gene identification, sequence annotation, and data analysesThe identification of potential protein coding sequences (CDSs) and their annotation was done by using GenomeGambler, version 1.5.26 We first identified CDSs longer than 50 amino acids. Then, by searching all the intergenic regions for CDSs showing sequence similarities to known proteins with the BLASTP program,27 we identified 69 CDSs shorter than 50 amino acids. Orthologous genes were identified using the MBGD (Microbial Genome Database for Comparative Analysis) database (http://mbgd.genome.ad.jp/).28Repetitive sequences were identified through sliding window analysis (window size, 100 bp; step size, 3 bp). All 100-bp sequence windows were searched against the entire genome sequence using the BLASTN program.27 The ssearch3 program29 was also used to define the borders of each repetitive sequence. The determination of the consensus sequences of each repetitive sequence and their classification were carried out by manual inspection based on the multiple alignments generated by the ClustalW program.30 Repeated gene families, which were defined in this study as the genes whose gene products exhibited at least 90% amino acid sequence identity over 60% of the alignment length, were identified by all-to-all BLASTP analysis of the O. tsutsugamushi gene products. The KEGG (Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes) database (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/)31 was used to analyze the metabolic pathways of O. tsutsugamushi. The annotated genome sequence of O. tsutsugamushi strain Ikeda has been deposited at the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databanks under accession number AP008981.3. Results and discussion3. 1. General features of the genomeOrientia tsutsugamushi has a circular chromosome consisting of 2 008 987 bp (Table 1 and Fig. 1). No plasmids or prophages were detected. A putative origin of replication (ori) was assigned through cumulative GC skew analysis, because no clear skew in the leading and lagging strands was observed through conventional GC skew analysis (Supplementary Fig. S3).32 The overall features of the O. tsutsugamushi genome are summarized in Table 1, and a comparison with selected members of the order Rickettsiales is given in Supplementary Table S1.Structural features of the O. tsutsugamushi genome. The putative origin of replication is located at the top. The outermost red rays show the repetition rates of each chromosomal region. The repetition rates were determined by sliding window analysis (window size, 100 bp; step size, 3 bp). The total number of 100-bp windows retrieved from the entire genome sequence was 669 663. All the 100-bp window sequences were searched for homologous regions using the BLASTN program. The repetition rate was defined as the total number of BLASTN hits (threshold: >120 BLASTN similarity score, excluding hits to their own sequences). The longest ray corresponds to the 108-folds repetition. The outermost black circle is a scale where the short dashes mark 100-kb intervals. The circles inside the scale show, from the outside in: (i) genes on the forward strand (singleton genes in black and repeated genes in red), (ii) genes on the reverse strand (singletons in black and repeated genes in red), (iii) OtAGE sequences on the forward (orange) and reverse (greenish yellow) strands, (iv) transposable elements (ISOt1 and mISOt1, green; ISOt2 and mISOt2, light blue; ISOt3, blue; ISOt4 and mISOt4, orange; ISOt5, dark blue; GIIOt1, red), (v) singleton genes (gray) and repeated genes (light red) whose homologues are present in R. bellii, (vi) R. felis, (vii) R. conorii, (viii) R. prowazekii, (ix) G + C content [%: blue, higher than the average of the whole genome (30.5%); orange, lower than the average], (x) GC skew [(G–C)/(G + C): blue, ≥0; orange, <0], and (xi) tRNA (green) and rRNA (orange) genes.Structural features of the O. tsutsugamushi genome.

Of the 1967 CDSs, as many as 1196 are repeated genes constituting 85 families (O. tsutsugamushiRepeated Gene families: OtRG1–OtRG85), where the members in each family exhibit more than 90% amino acid sequence identity (see Section 2 for the definition of repeated genes; all other genes that do not belong to any of the repeated gene families are referred to as ‘singleton genes’ in this study). This unusual gene duplication is associated with the explosive amplification of several repetitive sequences, as described below. Since massive gene decay has also taken place in these repeated genes, as much as 64% of the 1196 repeated CDSs (766) are pseudogenes (truncated, split, or degraded). In contrast, smaller numbers of pseudogenes were identified among the singleton genes (4.8%, or 37 out of the 771 CDSs). The proportion of pseudogenes among the singleton genes is, however, within a range similar to those of other Rickettsia genomes33–37 known to harbor relatively larger numbers of split genes, a signature of progressive genome reduction.Another striking feature of the O. tsutsugamushi genome is that it exhibits very poor colinearity to any of the previously sequenced Rickettsia genomes including that of R. bellii, which exhibits exceptionally little colinearity to other Rickettsia genomes33 (Supplementary Fig. S4). This suggests that extensive genome shuffling has taken place in the evolutionary course of O. tsutsugamushi. The massively amplified repetitive sequences may have mediated this genome shuffling.3.2. Explosive amplification of repetitive sequencesWe identified 18 types of repetitive sequences in the O. tsutsugamushi genome. They have explosively been amplified and scattered throughout the genome (Fig. 1). Although massive decay has also taken place in these repetitive sequences, their total length now reaches 933.8 kb (46.5% of the entire genome). Among the bacteria so far sequenced, Wolbachia pipientis wMel and Anaplasma phagocytophilum, both of which are obligate intracellular bacteria belonging to the order Rickettsiales, contain the highest proportion of repetitive sequences (14.2 and 12.7%, respectively),38 but much lower than O. tsutsugamushi (Supplementary Fig. S5). Of interest is that the size of the O. tsutsugamushi genome divested of these repetitive sequences is almost the same as that of the R. prowazekii genome (1070 and 1116 kb, respectively).The identified repetitive sequences were categorized into three types: (i) a genetic element which we named ‘O. tsutsugamushi amplified genetic element’ (OtAGE), (ii) transposable elements, and (iii) others (Table 1).The OtAGE is a large genetic element about 33 kb in size and encodes 33–38 genes. This element has explosively been amplified in the O. tsutsugamushi genome, and each copy has extensively been degenerated by various types of deletion and insertion. However, we could reconstitute a probable intact form of the OtAGE by comparing the structures of relatively large copies (Fig. 2). Based on the reconstituted structure, we identified a total of 185 remnants of the OtAGE in the O. tsutsugamushi genome. The sum of their lengths is ∼694 kb (34.6% of the entire genome). We could not define their integration junctions because of the high sequence variation and accumulation of transposable elements in the possible junction regions.Gene organization of OtAGEs (O. tsutsugamushi amplified genetic elements). The gene organizations of the longest 30 OtAGEs identified in the O. tsutsugamushi genome are shown. The structure of the intact OtAGE that we deduced from the structures of these 30 OtAGEs is shown at the top. Arrows depicted by solid lines indicate intact genes and those depicted by dotted lines indicate degraded ones. Genes for conjugal transfer are depicted in green, integrase genes in red, genes for ATPase domain-containing proteins in blue, genes for other functions in light orange, genes for transposases in yellow, conserved hypothetical genes in white, O. tsutsugamushi-specific hypothetical genes whose gene products exhibited no significant sequence similarities to known protein sequences in gray, and genes that were probably trapped or inserted in OtAGEs in black. Four types of integrase genes and three types of gene cassettes encoding ATPase domain-containing proteins are present. Balloon marks indicate the insertion sites of IS elements (the ISOt number is labeled for each IS element). Deleted regions are indicated by broken dotted lines.Gene organization of OtAGEs (O. tsutsugamushi amplified genetic elements).

Four types of integrase genes and three types of gene cassettes encoding ATPase domain-containing proteins are present. Balloon marks indicate the insertion sites of IS elements (the ISOt number is labeled for each IS element). Deleted regions are indicated by broken dotted lines.The OtAGE encodes an integrase gene (int) at the left end, which is followed by a set of genes for conjugative transfer (tra genes) similar to those in various conjugative plasmids represented by the F plasmid (Fig. 3). The OtAGE can thus be regarded as a member of the integrative and conjugative element (ICE) group, a recently recognized group of mobile genetic elements that disseminate by conjugative transfer like conjugative plasmids and integrate themselves into the genome like temperate bacteriophages.39 The tra gene product sequences are highly conserved between OtAGEs (>90% amino-acid sequence identity), but four types of int genes were clearly distinguished (OtRG10–OtRG14; OtRG12 and OtRG13 represent one split gene, Fig. 2). These integrases have significantly diverged in sequence (36–38% identity to each other), indicating that they have different origins.Comparison of the OtAGE with other integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs). The genetic organizations of the OtAGE and five other ICEs are drawn to scale. Only the regions required for conjugal transfer are shown, except for the OtAGE and an OtAGE-like ICE of R. bellii. The R. bellii element is integrated into a valine tRNA gene with 54-bp sequence duplication (indicated by red rhomboids). The R. felis plasmid contains only few genes related to conjugation. Genes for conjugal transfer are depicted by green boxes, those for integrase by red, those for transposase by yellow, those for ATPase domain-containing proteins by blue, conserved hypothetical genes by white, and O. tsutsugamushi-specific hypothetical genes by gray. The homologous regions are indicated by light green shading. Homologous regions were identified by the BLASTP program (e-value threshold: ≤1e−10). To identify the homologous regions in the traA, traE, and traV gene products, which showed higher sequence diversity between elements, we used the ClustalW program.30Comparison of the OtAGE with other integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs).

To identify the homologous regions in the traA, traE, and traV gene products, which showed higher sequence diversity between elements, we used the ClustalW program.30In the right one-third of the OtAGE, genes for various functions reside (Fig. 2). These include two genes encoding almost identical SpoT (ppGpp hydrolase)-like proteins, a gene cassette encoding multiple ATPase domain-containing proteins, and genes for DNA methylase and DNA helicase. As for the gene cassette encoding ATPase domain-containing proteins, three types of cassettes, each encoding two to four ATPase domain-containing proteins, were identified. The encoded ATPase domain-containing proteins exhibited significant sequence diversities, not only between the three types of cassettes but also within the same cassette (up to 49% amino-acid sequence identity, but in most cases less than 40%), indicating a complex evolutionary history of the gene cassettes. In addition, several genes, whose gene products are also apparently not related to conjugative transfer, such as peroxiredoxin and ankyrin repeat (AR)-proteins, were found to be inserted into various sites in the OtAGE.Among the tra gene clusters so far identified in various conjugative plasmids and ICEs, the gene cluster in the OtAGE is most similar in sequence and gene organization to that identified in the R. bellii genome33 (Fig. 3). The R. bellii tra gene cluster is also preceded by an int gene. Furthermore, the R. bellii int/tra gene cluster is located in a 38.7-kb element that is integrated into a valine tRNA gene with a terminal sequence duplication of 54 bp.40 The R. bellii element also contains a set of genes similar but not identical to those on the right part of the OtAGE, indicating that it is an ICE closely related to the OtAGE. Among the Rickettsia species so far sequenced, R. massiliae, which has very recently been sequenced,40 also contains an OtAGE-like element (data not shown) and R. felis contains a few tra genes or their remnants in a plasmid.34 We could not estimate the time point when the OtAGEs invaded O. tsutsugamushi. However, the presence of four distinct int genes and three different types of gene cassettes encoding ATPase domain-containing proteins among the OtAGEs may suggest that invasion of O. tsutsugamushi by similar but different types of OtAGEs took place at least four times.A sex pilus-like structure was observed on the cell surface of R. bellii, suggesting that the R. bellii ICE may still be active in conjugation.33 In contrast, all the OtAGEs contained various types of deletions, and many of the remaining tra genes have become pseudogenes by base substitution and deletion, or insertion of transposable elements (Fig. 2). Thus, all the OtAGEs currently present in O. tsutsugamushi strain Ikeda appear to be no longer transmissible by themselves.Although an increasing number of ICE have been identified in a wide range of prokaryotes, the amplification of ICEs in a single genome has never been reported so far. Thus, the amplification of the OtAGE is a quite unique phenomenon. The mechanism of this unusual amplification is not known. However, once a mutation affecting the inhibition mechanism of invasion by the same type of ICE, similar to TraT-mediated surface exclusion and TraS-mediated entry exclusion in the F plasmid,41,42 was introduced, reciprocal transfer of the OtAGE could have taken place between the O. tsutsugamushi cells densely inhabiting the host cell cytosol. Such reciprocal transfers may have induced the unusual amplification of the OtAGE in O. tsutsugamushi.We identified five types of insertion sequence (IS) elements (named ISOt1–ISOt5), four types of miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs), and a Group II (GII) intron (Fig. 4). None of these transposable elements is conserved in other sequenced Rickettsia genomes. Each type of transposable element has also been explosively amplified, and a total of 621 copies including their fragments were identified, altogether representing 13.0% of the genome (261 kb in total). The amplification of transposable elements has been described also in other obligate intracellular bacteria with reduced genomes, such as Wolbachia pipientis wMel [seven types of IS elements (51 copies in total) and four types of GII introns (17 copies)],38Parachlamydia sp. UWE25 [82 IS transposases (TPases)],43R. felis (82 TPases),34 and R. bellii (39 TPases).33 However, the number of copies in O. tsutsugamushi is more than 10 times higher than those in these bacteria, and comparable to that in Shigella dysenteriae, which contains the highest number of IS elements among the prokaryotes sequenced to date (701 copies in a 4469-kb chromosome and a 183-kb plasmid).44Transposable elements of O. tsutsugamushi strain Ikeda. The genetic organizations of the ransposable elements identified in the genome of O. tsutsugamushi strain Ikeda are drawn to scale. Family names, lengths and other information for each type of transposable element are also shown. ISOt1, ISOt2, and ISOt4 have cognate miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) namely mISOt1, mISOt2, and mISOt4, respectively. There are two variants of mISOt2 (mISOt2a and ISOt2b). Regions with almost identical sequences between IS elements and MITEs are indicated by dotted lines. Transposases and reverse transcriptases are depicted by orange arrows, and terminal inverted repeats by grey arrow heads. ISOt1 is most closely related to IS1381 among the members of the IS5 family, and ISOt5 to IS621 among the members of the IS630 family.Transposable elements of O. tsutsugamushi strain Ikeda.

ISOt1 is most closely related to IS1381 among the members of the IS5 family, and ISOt5 to IS621 among the members of the IS630 family.Among the five IS elements, two (ISOt2 and ISOt3) belong to the IS630 and Tc-1/mariner family. Tc-1/mariner elements are often found in the genomes of nematodes and insects, but rarely in bacteria.45 This may imply that ISOt2 and ISOt3 were transferred from chiggers. Among the four types of MITEs, one contains the same terminal inverted repeat sequences (TIRs) as ISOt1, and is therefore named ‘mISOt1’ (miniature ISOt1). Two (namely ‘mISOt2a’ and ‘mISOt2b’) share the same or very similar TIRs with ISOt2, and the remaining one (mISOt4) with ISOt4. The massive amplification of these MITEs (201 copies in total) suggests that they are (or at least were) very actively mobilized by transposases encoded in trans in the cognate IS elements. Although numerous MITEs have been found in many eukaryotic genomes,46 no such amplification of MITEs has been observed in prokaryotes. Similarly, to the best of our knowledge, O. tsutsugamushi contains the highest number of GII introns (51 copies) among the prokaryotes thus far sequenced, with Thermosynechococcus elongates BP-1 being the next with 28 copies (http://www.fp.ucalgary.ca/group2introns/).47 Many of the transposable elements identified in the O. tsutsugamushi genome have been truncated by deletion or fragmented by insertion of other transposable elements (Supplementary Fig. S6).We additionally identified seven types of repetitive sequences in the O. tsutsugamushi genome (165 copies in total) as summarized in Supplementary Table S2. These repetitive sequences, namely ‘Short Repeats of O. tsutsugamushi’ (SROt1–SROt7), are not related to the Rickettsia palindromic elements (RPEs) widely distributed in Rickettsia genomes.35 Among the seven SRs, only SROt2 (110 bp in length) was found to contain TIR-like sequences of 21 bp, suggesting that it may also be a type of MITE, although no cognate IS element was identified. The functions and origins of other SRs are unknown.3.3. Repeated genesThe massive amplification of repetitive sequences in the O. tsutsugamushi genome is directly or indirectly linked to the generation of a large number of repeated genes, which were classified into 85 OtRG families (Supplementary Table S3). Among these, nine are TPases and a reverse transcriptase/maturase in the IS elements and the GII intron, and 45 are the core components of the OtAGE mentioned above. The remaining 31 OtRG families are located at various sites in the chromosome, but are frequently associated with the ISs/MITEs and/or OtAGEs (Supplementary Fig. S7). This suggests that these mobile elements have been involved in the proliferation of many of these OtRG families. In fact, eight of the 31 OtRG families have a single orthologue in other rickettsial species. These genes may have been trapped in or between these mobile elements, and duplicated along with the amplification of the mobile elements. The eight OtRGs include a unique two-component system sensor histidine kinase/response regulator hybrid protein fused with a sodium/proton transporter domain (OtRG55) and a peroxiredoxin (OtRG59). These proteins may be involved in sensing and/or coping with osmotic or oxidative stresses which the bacterium encounters in the mite cells or during the infection of mammals. Most of the other OtRG families are hypothetical protein families with unknown functions, but their amplification may also have conferred some advantages to O. tsutsugamushi, by adapting them to the host environments. In this regard, of particular interest are several intramolecular repeat-containing proteins that have also been amplified (see Section 3.5).3.4. Singleton genes and the metabolic capacity of O. tsutsugamushiThe number of singleton genes (771 genes) identified in the O. tsutsugamushi genome is lower than the total number of CDSs (834) in R. prowazekii, which has the smallest genome among the Rickettsia species so far sequenced.36 As shown in Table 2, the genome comparison of O. tsutsugamushi and R. prowazekii revealed 542 genes that are shared by the two species. Most of them (519 genes, 95.8%) are conserved in all other sequenced Rickettsia species (Table 2), and are therefore likely to represent the core gene set of the family Rickettsiaceae. This set includes various housekeeping genes and also a set of genes for the type IV secretion system (T4SS) similar to the virB system of Agrobacterium tumefaciens. Despite the extensive genome shuffling, the organization of T4SS genes is highly conserved between O. tsutsugamushi and Rickettsia. A similar set of T4SS genes is also conserved in the family Anaplasmataceae (Supplementary Fig. S8). This strongly suggests that T4SS plays an essential role in maintaining the intracellular life style of the members of the order Rickettsiales.Conservation of the O. tsutsugamushi singleton genes in the sequenced five Rickettsia speciesaaThe five Rickettsia species examined here include R. prowazekii, R. conorii, R. felis, R. typhi, and R. bellii.bOt(+)/Rp(−), O. tsutsugamushi singleton genes that are not present in R. prowazekii; Ot(+)/Rp(+), O. tsutsugamushi singleton genes that are present in R. prowazekii; Ot(−)/Rp(+), R. prowazekii genes that are not present in O. tsutsugamushi.cThe numbers of genes encoding hypothetical proteins of unknown functions are indicated in parentheses.Conservation of the O. tsutsugamushi singleton genes in the sequenced five Rickettsia speciesaaThe five Rickettsia species examined here include R. prowazekii, R. conorii, R. felis, R. typhi, and R. bellii.bOt(+)/Rp(−), O. tsutsugamushi singleton genes that are not present in R. prowazekii; Ot(+)/Rp(+), O. tsutsugamushi singleton genes that are present in R. prowazekii; Ot(−)/Rp(+), R. prowazekii genes that are not present in O. tsutsugamushi.cThe numbers of genes encoding hypothetical proteins of unknown functions are indicated in parentheses.It has been previously reported that O. tsutsugamushi cells do not contain lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and peptidoglycan, while the members of genus Rickettsia contain these cellular components.48 Consistent with this, the electron-microscopic appearance of the outer membrane of O. tsutsugamushi is very different from those of the members of the genus Rickettsia, and these differences were the major reasons to separate O. tsutsugamushi from the genus Rickettsia.49 The higher sensitivity to various physical stresses observed in O. tsutsugamushi may also be attributable to these differences. Unexpectedly, a set of genes required for the biosynthesis and degradation of peptidoglycan was identified in O. tsutsugamushi, although those for LPS biosynthesis were completely missing. In our preliminary proteome analysis, we confirmed that at least 10 of these peptidoglycan biosynthesis-related genes were expressed in the O. tsutsugamushi cells grown in L929 cells (data not shown).Through the genomic comparison of O. tsutsugamushi and R. prowazekii, we also identified 195 O. tsutsugamushi singleton genes that are absent or degraded in R. prowazekii (referred to as ‘O. tsutsugamushi-specific’ genes), and 257 R. prowazekii genes that are absent or degraded in O. tsutsugamushi (referred to as ‘R. prowazekii-specific’ genes) (Table 2, Supplementary Table S4). Of the 195 O. tsutsugamushi-specific genes, 161 are absent in all other sequenced Rickettsia species, and 94 genes exhibit no significant homology to known proteins. This finding suggests that a significant portion of the O. tsutsugamushi-specific genes have foreign origins. It is noteworthy that these genes are often clustered in the O. tsutsugamushi genome (data not shown), suggesting that they have been brought into O. tsutsugamushi as blocks. A prominent example is a genomic region about 19 kb in size located around the 550-kb position in the O. tsutsugamushi chromosome (Fig. 1). This region exhibits a higher G + C composition than the average of the O. tsutsugamushi genome, and 23 Orientia-specific genes are accumulated. Two major surface antigens of O. tsutsugamushi, i.e. the 56- and 22-kDa proteins (OTT_0945 and OTT_1548, respectively), and a 56-kDa protein-like protein (OTT_0946) are also O. tsutsugamushi specific.Among the 257 R. prowazekii-specific genes, 178 are conserved in all the Rickettsia species so far sequenced. Of the 178 genes, 139 have their orthologues in a wide range of alpha-Proteobacteria. Thus, at least these 139 genes can be regarded as genes that have been deleted or degraded in the lineage leading to O. tsutsugamushi after separation from the Rickettsia family. It is noteworthy that they include a significant number of genes for various housekeeping functions, such as the formation of a cell envelope, energy metabolism, fatty-acid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and DNA recombination and repair (indicated by red arrows in Fig. 5; see also Supplementary Table S3). Several genes for RNA synthesis and modification, such as the RNA polymerase omega subunit and RNA helicase RhlE, those for stress response, such as the HslUV protease, ClpB chaperone, BipA GTPase and the OsmY protein, and those for drug sensitivity, such as the EmrA and EmrB proteins, are also specifically missing in O. tsutsugamushi. In addition, the genes for hemolysin A and patatin-like phospholipase, both of which are thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of Rickettsia species, are missing in O. tsutsugamushi.Metabolic pathways of O. tsutsugamushi and R. prowazekii. The metabolic pathways of O. tsutsugamushi and R. prowazekii are compared. Pathways identified in both bacteria are indicated by black arrows, those identified in neither bacterium by gray broken-lined arrows, those identified only in O. tsutsugamushi by green arrows, and those identified only in R. prowazekii by red arrows.

Genes for DNA repair functions that were identified in O. tsutsugamushi and R. prowazekii are listed in the box.Metabolic pathways of O. tsutsugamushi and R. prowazekii. The metabolic pathways of O. tsutsugamushi and R. prowazekii are compared. Pathways identified in both bacteria are indicated by black arrows, those identified in neither bacterium by gray broken-lined arrows, those identified only in O. tsutsugamushi by green arrows, and those identified only in R. prowazekii by red arrows. Pink arrows indicate the pathways that exhibit variable distribution in the genus Rickettsia but are absent in O. tsutsugamushi. Genes for DNA repair functions that were identified in O. tsutsugamushi and R. prowazekii are listed in the box.Many genes for nucleotide metabolism, including those for de novo synthesis pathways, are absent in O. tsutsugamushi, as in Rickettsia species (Fig. 5). The genes for CTP synthase and cytidylate kinase are additionally missing in O. tsutsugamushi. This may have rendered the bacterium more dependent on the host cell functions for the pyrimidine nucleotides. All these defects are probably compensated by the presence of five types of nucleotide transporters, as shown in Chlamydia trachomatis.50 This may also be the case for the nicotinamido adenine dinucleotide (NAD) metabolism.51DNA recombination and repair systems are relatively well conserved in Rickettsia species (Fig. 5). But a significant number of genes for these functions have specifically been deleted in O. tsutsugamushi, such as those for the UvrB, UvrC, RecN and RecG proteins and the transcription-repair coupling factor Mfd. This may be related to the acquisition and amplification of mobile genetic elements, as well as to the maintenance of an extremely repeat-rich genome.Of particular interest is the lack of pyruvate dehydrogenase due to the deletion of the pdhABC genes and a second copy of pdhD. Other pathways generating acetyl-CoA are also missing (Fig. 5). Thus, the bacterium appears to be unable to synthesize acetyl-CoA. This defect is probably linked to the incomplete tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle of the bacterium, where the citrate synthase and aconitate hydratase genes are inactivated by an authentic frame shift mutation and a premature stop codon, respectively (Fig. 5). However, these defects may be bypassed by asparate aminotransferase, which catalyzes the oxaloacetate/alpha-ketoglutarate interconversion. Pyruvate may also be introduced into the TCA cycle by malate oxidoreductase. In addition, the glycoxylate cycle is missing in O. tsutsugamushi, as in Rickettsia species.The inability to synthesize acetyl-CoA probably is further linked to the deletion of the genes for acetyl-CoA carboxylase, which catalyzes the transfer of carboxyl groups to acetyl-CoA to generate malonyl-CoA, the first step in fatty-acid biosynthesis (Fig. 5). The genes for biotin-apoprotein ligase (birA) and biotin transporter (bioY), which are required for the formation of biotin carboxyl carrier protein, are also specifically missing in O. tsutsugamushi. In addition, the fabH gene encoding KAS III, which catalyzes the condensation of the acetyl-CoA starter unit with malonyl-ACP to yield acetoacetyl-CoA, the first step in the fatty-acid elongation pathway, is missing. Although the gene for KAS I is also absent as in Rickettsia species, the genes for malonyl-CoA:ACP transacylase and KAS II (fabD and fabF) are conserved. It is thus most likely that fatty-acid biosynthesis in O. tsutsugamushi is initiated by these two enzymes using host-derived malonyl-CoA.Another distinguishing feature of O. tsutsugamushi is the lack of genes for lipoprotein biosynthesis. Although a gene for lipoprotein-specific leader peptidase (lsp) was identified, other genes for the modification and localization of lipoproteins (lgt, lnt, lolA/B/C/E/D) are missing (Supplementary Table S3). This may raise the possibility that O. tsutsugamushi lacks lipoproteins or has a very unique lipoprotein biosynthesis system. Consistent with this, of the five O. tsutsugamushi proteins whose homologues have been predicted to be lipoproteins in Rickettsia species, none contains the typical lipobox required for processing and lipid-modification of lipoproteins. This finding, together with the absence of LPS, suggests that a simple cell envelope may be advantageous to the intracellular life of O. tsutsugamushi.All these genomic features of O. tsutsugamushi indicate that high levels of horizontal gene transfer (HGT) and gene amplification have occurred in O. tsutsugamushi after it diverged from the genus Rickettsia. On the other hand, O. tsutsugamushi has also undergone further reductive genome evolution and established an intracellular lifestyle that is more dependent on its host cell functions than Rickettsia species.3.5. Repeat-containing proteinsAs briefly mentioned in Section 3.3, the OtRG families include eight types of ankyrin repeat-containing proteins (AR proteins), four tetratricopeptide repeat-containing proteins (TPR proteins), and two novel repeat-containing proteins (Fig. 6). We additionally identified 11 singleton genes encoding different types of AR proteins and five singleton genes encoding novel repeat-containing proteins. Ankyrin repeats have been found in many eukaryotic proteins and are known to mediate various protein–protein interactions.52 However, they are rarely found in prokaryotes. Several bacteria, most of which are intracellular bacteria, such as R. felis, R. bellii, W. pipientis, Legionella pneumonia, and Coxiella burnetii, are exceptionally enriched in AR proteins (18–25 proteins), and these proteins are suspected to be involved in host–bacterial interactions. Orientia tsutsugamushi contains 20 types of genes for AR proteins, and the total number of copies (46) greatly exceeds those of other intracellular bacteria. As all these AR proteins have no signal sequence for the general secretion pathway, they could be candidates for the effecter proteins secreted by T4SS. And they may be involved in the modulation of host-cell functions by O. tsutsugamushi, which is required for the bacterium to develop and maintain a symbiotic relationship in mite cells and/or survive and propagate in mammals. Other repeat-containing proteins also do not possess apparent signal sequences, suggesting that they would also be T4SS effector candidates.Repeat-containing proteins of O. tsutsugamushi.

Genome comparison with O. tsutsugamushi strain BoryongWhile we were preparing this report, the genome sequence of O. tsutsugamushi strain Boryong isolated in Korea was reported.14 The genome size of strain Boryong (2 127 051 bp) is 118 kb longer than that of IKEDA, but the G + C content and the numbers of rRNA and tRNA genes are the same as those of IKEDA. Homology search of the 542 genes that are shared by strain IKEDA and R. prowazekii using BLASTN revealed that 540 genes are also conserved in strain Boryong. This indicates that the genome backbone is highly conserved between the two strains. The homologues exhibited high level of sequence conservation (97.5% identity on average) while notable sequence variations were observed in several genes for surface proteins.Search of the mobile elements identified in IKEDA using BLASTN revealed that all the elements, including OtAGE, are also present and have explosively been amplified in strain Boryong. Although exact numbers of each element in Boryong are yet to be determined, this result suggests that these elements invaded into O. tsutsugamushi before the separation of the two strains. More importantly, the result of our preliminary dot-plot analysis of the two genomes suggested that intensive genome shuffling has also taken place between the two O. tsutsugamushi strains. Although more careful and intensive comparison of the two genomes is required, the amplified mobile elements seem to have been deeply involved in the genome shuffling.3.7. ConclusionIn O. tsutsugamushi, high level of gene loss has taken place like in other obligate intracellular bacteria, but massive amplification of various mobile elements has also taken place, which has induced intensive genome shuffling and generated a large number of repeated genes. Although the timing of the acquisition and/or amplification of these elements are yet to be elucidated, the extremely narrow population bottleneck created by the unique life cycle of the bacterium appears to have allowed such a very unique genome evolution. Thus, the genome sequence of O. tsutsugamushi strain Ikeda will be not only the genetic basis for a better understanding of the biology of the bacterium and pathogenesis of the ‘Tsutsugamushi’ disease, but also a very attractive material for studying the processes of genome evolution and the high plasticity of bacterial genomes.FundingThis work was supported by the Research for the Future Program of the Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS-RFTF00L01411) and Grants-in-Aid from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.We thank Eiichi Ohtsubo and Kenji Ichiyanagi for their help in our analysis of the IS elements and GII introns.

IntroductionRhizobia are known to inhabit the soil as free-living cells or the nodules as nitrogen-fixing endosymbiont with leguminous plants to convert atmospheric dinitrogen (N2) into biologically usable ammonia (NH3). The symbiosis between rhizobia and leguminous plants is an unimaginably elaborated process, and the movement of rhizobia to the germinating seed and root of the host plant is considered to be important in the early step of nodulation for colonization in rhizosphere. Both chemotaxis and motility contribute to the colonization in rhizosphere and were reported to correlate with the competition for the nodulation between rhizobia, e.g. non-motile and -chemotactic mutants required 10- to 30-fold number of cells to form nodules at the same rate as the wild strain.1 Exudates of soybean seed and root are known to contain a wide range of organic compounds, and some of which showed attractive action to rhizobia.2 Amino acids such as glutamate and dicarboxylic acids such as succinate are reported to have a strong attractive action to Bradyrhizobium japonicum cells.3,4It has been well established that the leguminous plant-released iso/flavonoid signals induce nod genes of rhizobia so that they can produce Nod-factors, lipo-chito oligosaccharides that specifically trigger various plant responses and initiation of cell division to form the nitrogen-fixing root nodules.5,6 Genistein and daidzein are isoflavones present in exudates of soybean seed and root, and major nod-genes inducers in B. japonicum. Thus, they are well used as inducers for expression analyses of symbiotic genes by using transcriptional lacZ fusion.7–11 Unlike the exudates, however, these isoflavones were not chemoattractant of B. japonicum cells, although Rhizobium cells exhibited chemotaxis to their nod-genes inducer.12,13 Besides, the double mutant of two global regulatory families, nodD1 and nodW, was reported to be unable to induce nodY–lacZ fusion in the presence of genistein or daidzein, but still showed a 2- to 3-fold induction in the presence of soybean seed extracts (SSE).14 These reports suggest that the signal exchange in the early stages of B. japonicum-soybean symbiosis cannot be explained only by a simple paradigm of flavonoid-Nod factors.The whole genomic sequence of B. japonicum USDA 110 (9.10 Mb) has been recently completed, and as in Mesorhizobium loti MAFF303099, B. japonicum also carries a symbiosis island of 681 kb on genome, in which most of the key genes relevant to the symbiotic nitrogen fixation (nod, nif, and fix) are concentrated.15,16 A oligonucleotide microarray for genome-wide transcript analysis in B. japonicum under a variety of conditions, such as minimal versus rich medium, free-living versus bacteroids, aerobic versus microaerobic, and desiccation versus osmotic stress, has also been reported, recently.17–19 However, little is known about the comparative effects of SSE and genistein on the genome-wide expression of B. japonicum in the initial symbiotic process. In this study, we used a DNA macroarray based on the M13 clones of B. japonicum USDA 110 genome as a comprehensive tool to monitor the comparative global expression of its genomic loci in response to SSE and genistein. Results revealed that SSE collectively and markedly induced four predominant genomic regions inside symbiosis island with some genomic loci outside, suggesting that the SSE-induced B. japonicum genomic loci are relevant to the initial interaction with soybean.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains and culture conditionsBradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110 was used as a wild-type strain for global expression analysis throughout the experiment. Bradyrhizobium japonicum ZB977 harboring a plasmid (pZB32) with a lacZ fusion in nodY based on the background of B. japonicum USDA 1108 was used as an indicator strain to determine the induction conditions (Supplementary Fig. S1). Bradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110 and ZB977 were maintained on the yeast extract-mannitol agar (YMA) with chloramphenicol (30 µg/mL) and tetracycline (50 µg/mL), respectively, and cultured in yeast extract-mannitol broth (YMB) without antibiotics for the induction experiments in the presence of SSE or genistein.20,212.2. RNA preparation, hybridization, and image captureBradyrhizobium japonicum USDA 110 cells were pre-cultured in 50 mL of YMB without antibiotics for 3 days at 30°C and then scaled up to 200 mL of YMB for growing to mid- log-phase (OD600 = 0.3–0.5). The cells were then diluted with fresh YMB to OD600 of 0.1 and induced with SSE (20 µL/mL of culture) or genistein (5.0 µM) under the conditions determined by B. japonicum ZB977. After the equal volume of ice-cold 5% (w/v) phenol/EtOH was quickly added into the culture to minimize the degradation of mRNA, the cells were immediately harvested and stored at –80°C.22 Total RNA was isolated according to the protocols provided by the manufacturer of ISOGEN-LS (Nippon Gene Co., Tokyo, Japan) and treated with DNase I at 37°C for 30 min. After the mRNAs were enriched with the MICROBExpressTM Kit (Ambion, Austin, TX, USA), cDNA labeling was carried out as described previously.23We used a DNA macroarray of B. japonicum USDA 110, and hybridization, image acquisition, and data analyses were done as described previously.23,24 Briefly, after pre-hybridization in Church's phosphate buffer at 55°C for at least 6 h, hybridization was carried out in the same buffer containing probe cDNA at 55°C for at least 15 h. Then, washing was done three times at room temperature in 2 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 5 min, twice at room temperature in 0.3 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 10 min, and twice at 55°C in 0.3 × SSC containing 0.1% SDS for 10 min, in this order. Array membranes were exposed to the PhosphorImager and the hybridized signals were captured as image files by using a BioImaging analyzer (BAS5000, Fuji Film). At least three independent sets of array analysis using duplicate array membranes were performed.2.3. Data analysesThe signal intensity of each spot was quantified by using ArrayVision software (GE Healthcare Bio-Sci, NJ, USA) after the subtraction of the local background value and normalized on the basis of the total sum of the signal intensities of spots on one array sheet. The relative expression levels of each clone between SSE/genistein-treatment and untreatment were represented by the ratio of the corresponding normalized signal intensity. The value of log10 (expression ratio) for each clone was calculated to construct the genome-wide expression profiles. The log10 (expression ratio) of all 3960 clones complied normal distribution and the mean was approximately 0.0, indicating that any expression ratio is significant (95% confidence) if the value of the log10 (expression ratio) is greater or lower than 1.96 standard deviations from the mean (0.0).252.4. Quantitative real-time RT–PCRThe relative intensity of gene expression was validated by quantitative real-time RT–PCR. The primers were designed by Primer 3 (http://frodo.wi.mit.edu/cgi-bin/primer3/primer3_www.cgi). Three hundred nanograms of total RNA was used as a template and real-time RT–PCRs were performed with MiniOpticonTM Version 3.1(Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA,USA) in combination with the QuantiTect SYBR Green RT-PCR (Qiagen GmbH, Hilden, Germany). Quantification was performed using the Pfaffl method according to the real-time RT–PCR application guide provided by Bio-Rad. The housekeeping gene of B. japonicum, sigA, was used as an internal reference for quantitative real-time RT–PCR as reported previously,18,23 since the expression levels of sigA gene, which was regularly spotted on the array membranes, were not significantly changed with the SSE/genistein-treatment in this experimental condition.3. Results3.1. One giant expression region corresponds to the symbiosis islandThe SSE-induced nodY–lacZ expression at the different cell densities was monitored by β-galactosidase activity (Supplementary Fig. S1), and the comparative genome-wide expression profiles of the cells in response to SSE and genistein were captured under the following conditions: initial cell density, OD600 = 0.1; SSE and genistein concentration, 20 μL/mL and 5 µM; induction periods, 0.5, 6 and 12 h post-induction (hpi). As shown in Fig. 1, one giant chromosomal region (1.68–2.36 Mb) was markedly and collectively induced with time and reached maximum at 12 hpi in the presence of SSE or genistein. This region showed the similar expression profiles between SSE- and genistein-treated cells. However, the levels induced by SSE were much more conspicuous as compared with those by genistein. The expression profile of cells induced by EtOH, which was a solvent of SSE and genistein, indicated that there were no strongly induced loci except for one locus (covering genes from bll0330 to blr0336), including a probable alcohol dehydrogenase precursor (bll0333) (Fig. 1), suggesting that the expression patterns were mainly obtained by the SSE or genistein in itself.Genome-wide expression profiling of B. japonicum USDA 110 in response to SSE and genistein (GEN) at 0.5, 6, and 12 hpi, respectively. Expression profiles were constructed as the value of log10 (expression ratio) of 3960 clones covering the whole genome as described in Section 2. Expression levels of each clone were sorted according to the genome coordinate and represented by a single bar. The symbiosis island is located on the chromosome at coordinates 1.68–2.36 Mb.16 Red- and blue-colored arrows indicate some positions of strongly induced and reduced loci outside symbiosis island (LOSs: LOS1-22), which cover genes as shown in Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, respectively.Genome-wide expression profiling of B. japonicum USDA 110 in response to SSE and genistein (GEN) at 0.5, 6, and 12 hpi, respectively.

As shown in Fig. 5B, among 139 significantly up-regulated clones (expression ratio ≥ 2.2-fold) on the whole genome, 68 (49%) were located inside the symbiosis island, whereas all significantly down-regulated clones (expression ratio ≤ 0.4-fold) were outside this genomic island. For genistein-treated cells at 12 hpi, however, among 89 significantly up-regulated clones on the whole genome, only 14 (16%) were located inside symbiosis island and five (6%) were significantly down-regulated in this region. The results here show that symbiosis island is induced by both SSE and genistein, but the expression levels were much more intensive for SSE-treatment.3.2. Symbiosis island functions as great expression clustersFig. 2 shows the expression profiles of symbiosis island in a smaller window size. In consequence, four predominant expression clusters (ECs) were identified and designated as EC-I, -II, -III, and -IV considering more than 10 successively up-regulated (expression ratio ≥ 1.0-fold) adjacent clones as a cluster. Among ECs, the expression levels of EC-III and -IV were clearly greater than those of EC-I and -II by covering more significantly up-regulated clones. A part of EC-I and -II was also induced with SSE and genistein at 0.5 and/or 6 hpi. However, their expression levels induced by genistein were considerably weak as compared with those by SSE at 12 hpi. EC-III was strongly induced by SSE at 12 hpi. A similar profile of it was also found in genistein-treated cells at 12 hpi, but the expression levels were considerably weak. The profiles of EC-IV were very similar between SSE- and genistein-treated cells at 6 and 12 hpi. The expression features of ECs and their covered genes are shown in Figs 2 and 3 and Supplementary Table S1.Expression profiles of the symbiosis island of B. japonicum USDA 110 induced by SSE and genistein (GEN) at 0.5, 6, and 12 hpi, respectively.

White and black bars indicate the expression levels of clones in response to SSE and genistein, respectively.Comparative expression profiles of clones and their covered genes within ECs after the treatment of SSE or genistein at 0.5, 6, and 12 hpi, respectively. tts and nod genes operon correspond to rhC1C2JNQRSTUV for the type III secretion system and nolZY-nolA-nodD2-nodD1YABCSUIJ-nolMNO-nodZ for the nodulation, respectively. The detailed expression profiles of EC-III and -IV are shown in Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S1. White and black bars indicate the expression levels of clones in response to SSE and genistein, respectively.EC-I contained 13 clones covering 33 genes from blr1625 to blr1657 (at the coordinate 1,781,581–1,815,640) and most of them encode putative transposase (7 genes) and unknown (or hypothetical) proteins (19 genes). One locus (clone 2–4) covering five genes that encode multidrug resistance protein (blr1629), NolK (bll1630), NoeL (bll1631), NodM (blr1632), and NoeD (blr1633) was induced by SSE and genistein at 6 hpi and then became weaker at 12 hpi. Downstream of this locus, two other loci (clone 5–7, 11–12) covering 12 genes (bll1634–bsl1639, blr1649–bsl1654) were exclusively induced by SSE at 12 hpi. However, all these 12 genes were assigned into unknown or hypothetical protein-encoding genes.EC-II contained 23 clones covering genes from blr1689 to blr1735 (at the coordinate 1,845,670–1, 898,742), and two loci (clone 7–10 and 15–17) were induced by SSE or/and genistein. The former locus covering three genes that encode hypothetical (bll1703, blr1704) or unknown proteins (blr1705) was only induced by SSE at 12 hpi. Whereas, the latter locus covering four genes that encode two-component response regulator (bsl1713), NodW (bll1714), NodV (bll1715), and putative transposase (blr1716) was induced 2.1- to 8.6-fold by both SSE and genistein during 12 h. NodWV was identified as a two-component system that is unique to B. japonicum and directly induces nodYABC operon in response to genistein.14,26,27 The long-range expression manner of nodWV here supports its important roles in the early symbiotic process.EC-III contained 29 clones covering genes from bll1796 to blr1867 (at the coordinate 1,953,234–2, 020,145) and 20 clones among them (69.0%) were induced 2.4- to 20.7-fold by SSE at 12 hpi. On the other hand, most of the clones (20 among 29 clones) also tended to be up-regulated by genistein, however, only five clones (clone 3, 5, 18, 20, and 28) exhibited the significant expression levels, indicating that this cluster was significantly and preferentially induced by SSE (Figs 3 and 4A). These SSE-induced clones were divided into three loci, the first locus (clone 1–13) including genes from bll1796 to bll1832, the second (clone 17–21) from blr1839 to blr1847, and the third (clone 27–29) from blr1859 to bll1864, respectively. A genes cluster (tts) encoding recently identified type III secretion system (TTSS) of B. japonicum, rhcC1C2JNQRSTUV (bll1811–bll1842–blr1813–blr1816–blr1818–blr1819–bsr1820–blr1821–blr1822–bll1800),16,28 was completely included within the former two loci. Recently, it has been reported that mutations within tts of B. japonicum affected the symbiosis in a host-dependent manner.29 Besides, several genistein-inducible TTSS-secreted proteins were identified in B. japonicum 110spc4, including three hypothetical proteins encoded by genes blr1649 (covered by clone 11 and 12) in EC-I, blr1806 (covered by clone 4, first locus) and bll1862 (covered by clone 27 and 28, third locus) in EC-III, respectively.30 This experiment showed that clones covering these genes were induced by SSE (Supplementary Table S1). Among six genes covered by the third locus, only two genes have putative functions, i.e. putative transposase (bll1861) and citrate–proton symporter (bll1864, citA), respectively. However, the presence of a nod box located between bll1862 and bsr1863, as well as a σ54 consensus between bll1864 and blr1865,28 suggests that the third locus might play a role in symbiosis.Expression profiles of clones and their covered genes in (A) EC-III and (B) EC-IV at 12 hpi after the treatment of SSE and genistein (GEN).

Genes rhcN (blr1816) and ttsI (bll1843) in EC-III and nodC (blr2027) in EC-IV were selected for validation by real-time RT–PCR. tts box (tcGTCAGctTNtcGaa AGct-N3-ccNcctA), nod box (ATCCA-N7-GATG-N6-ATCCAAACAATCGATTTTACCAATC), and δ54 consensus (TGGCAC-N5-TTGCT/A) are described previously.28,30The most strongly induced genes cluster on the genome was EC-IV covering genes from bsr2010 to bll2067 (at the coordinate 2,171,906–2,232,429) (Figs 2 and 3). Among the 23 clones covered in EC-IV, 16 clones (clone 1–11, 15, and 20–23) (69.6%) were strongly induced by SSE at 12 hpi (2.8- to 52.3-fold). The induction of EC-IV occurred in advance of EC-III and its expression patterns, particularly those of clone 2, 5–8, and 20, were very similar between SSE- and genistein-treated cells at 6 and 12 hpi (Fig. 4B). Clone 1–11 covering 31 genes from bsr2010 to bll2040 completely involved a great genes cluster, nolZY-[2genes]-nolA-[1gene]-nodD2-[1gene]-nodD1YABCSUIJ-nolMNO-nodZ-fixR-nifA-fixA(bsl2015-blr2038), which was reported previously.16,31 The nolZY-nolA-nodD2-nodD1YABCSUIJ-nolMNO-nodZ has been identified as a common nod genes operon involved in the biosynthesis, modification and transport of Nod-factor and reported to be essential for the process of nodulation.32,33 Downstream of this nod genes operon, clone 20 was induced at least 4.5-fold by both SSE and genistein during 12 h, suggesting that either or both of its covered two adjacent genes (bsr2061 and blr2062) were induced strongly. The blr2062 has been estimated to encode a nodulation protein, NoeI, although the function of bsr2061 is still unknown. These results support that nod genes operon is an important locus of B. japonicum in the initial stage of the symbiotic process, and suggest that the genistein is one major nod-genes inducer in SSE.Clone 21 was induced more than 3.2-fold by both SSE and genistein at 6 and/or 12 hpi suggesting that its covered single gene (bll2063, nrgC) was induced strongly. nrgC was reported to be NifA-regulated but not essential for symbiosis.34 The loci covered by clone 15 and 22–23 were also induced beyond 2.8-fold by SSE at 12 hpi, but only three genes bll2049, bll2065, and bll2067 have functions as anthranilate phosphoribosyltransferase (trpD), carbonic anhydrase, and nodulate formation efficiency C protein (nfeC), respectively.Clones covering a large genes cluster, nifDKENX-fer3-nifS-fixU-nifB-frxA-nifZ-nifH- fixBCX (blr1743–bsr1775), which are located between EC-II and -III and likely to be required for nitrogen fixation under microaerobic conditions,16 showed no potential changes of the expression in the presence of either SSE or genistein except for one clone covering genes from bsr1749 to blr1752 (Fig. 2). One operon composed of eight ORFs (blr2077–bsl2084), which was reported to be likely involved in the biosynthesis of rhizobitoxine-like (RtxA) molecule,28 as well as another five ORFs (blr2143–blr2147) for cytochrome P450-family proteins did not also substantially respond to either SSE or genistein. These results support the previous report that rhizobitoxine production is confined exclusively to genotype II strains of B. japonicum and cytochrome P450 are well expressed in bacteroids.35,363.3. Exclusively expressed loci by SSENine loci covered by 19 clones inside symbiosis island but outside ECs (LISs: LIS 1–9) were exclusively induced by SSE at 12 hpi (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S2). The LIS 7 covered by two clones (brb19974, brb02802) was induced 2.8- to 12.5–fold, suggesting that either or both of the two adjacent genes encoding polygalacturonase (blr1993) and pectinesterase (blr1994) were induced strongly. Besides, one clone (brb06413) in LIS 6 was also induced 3.9-fold, suggesting that putative sugar hydrolase (blr1964) was likely induced. These results suggest that plant cell wall-degrading enzymes were preferentially induced by SSE. However, the locus covered by clone 13 in EC-I was not induced strongly, suggesting that a gene encoding another putative sugar hydrolase (blr1656), which was reported to be strongly induced by the genistein in a nodW-dependent manner,37 did not show the substantial expression change. For other LISs, genes encoding a TTSS-secreted protein similar to NopP of Rhizobium sp. NGR234 (blr1752 in LIS 3),30 alanine dehydrogenase (blr1738 in LIS 3), ferredoxin (bsr1739, bsr1750 in LIS 3), putative bacA (blr1902 in LIS 5), two NoeE homologs (blr2073, blr2074 in LIS 8), and putative transketolase (blr2168, blr2169 in LIS 9) were also putatively induced. However, around 59.5% (25/42 genes) of the products of putatively induced genes covered by LISs were unknown or hypothetical proteins.In addition, nine loci outside symbiosis island (LOSs: LOS 1–6, 13–15) were also induced by SSE (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S3). The LOS 6 covered by 14 clones (from blr2358 to bll2381 at the coordinate 2,561,229–2,595,246) was located downstream of the symbiosis island and induced by SSE with time. This locus was reported to be likely involved in a genes cluster (exo) for exopolysaccharide (EPS) synthesis and deletion mutants within exo caused a delayed nodule initiation.16,38 LOS 15 (from bll5380 to bll5420 at the coordinate 5,925,788–5,964,027) composed of 17 clones and 13 of them were strongly induced with time by SSE. Among 39 putatively induced genes, 27 genes (69.2%) encode ribosomal proteins. On the other hand, another large locus, LOS 19 covered by 16 clones (from blr6843 to blr6883 at the coordinate 7,540,433–7,575,109), was not potentially induced by SSE but by genistein (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S3). Among 15 putatively induced genes, 12 genes (80.0%) encoded flagella-related proteins. Recently, it has been reported that abundant extracellular proteins from genistein-induced wild-type B. japonicum were identified as flagellin and the deletion mutant of bll6865 and bll6866 had a thick flagellum without thin flagella.30,39Moreover, LOS 2 covered by four clones (from blr0232 to bll0242 at the coordinate 228,013–237, 522) tended to be induced by SSE during 12 h. One clone (brb07072) was induced 1.4- to 6.9-fold, suggesting that either or both of the two adjacent genes (blr0240, blr0241) were induced strongly. The product of blr0241 has been reported to be 80% identical with 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylate (ACC) deaminase of M. loti (mlr5932), which is likely involved in nodulation enhancement.23 Other six loci covering genes related to energy metabolism, transporter and regulator such as cytochrome O ubiquinol oxidase (blr0149–blr0152 in LOS 1), transporter family (bll0379–bll0381 in LOS 3), ATP synthase (bll0439–bll0443 in LOS 4, bll1185–bsl1189 in LOS 5), NADH ubiquinone oxidoreductase (bll4904–bll4919 in LOS 13), and transcriptional regulator and dehydrogenase (bll5275–blr5278 in LOS 14) were also induced by SSE. Contrarily, two loci covering genes encoding two component sensor/regulator (bll6184–blr6185 in LOS 18, bll7306–bll7307 in LOS 21) and alcohol dehydrogenase (blr6207, blr6213, blr6215, and bll6220 in LOS 18) were repressed.3.4. Expression loci shared between SSE- and genistein-treated cellsIn addition to genomic loci covering nod genes, six loci outside symbiosis island were induced with sharing between SSE- and genistein-treated cells during 12 h (LOS 7, 9–10, 12, 16, and 20) (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S4). Two adjacent clones (brb11706, brb23885) in LOS 12 were induced 2.2- to 27.6-fold during 12 h, suggesting that either or both of the two adjacent genes (blr4773, blr4774) were induced strongly. NwsAB (blr4773 and blr4774) was identified as a two-component system to function with NodWV in a cross-talk way and involved in the quorum regulation of the nodulation genes.40,41 Two adjacent clones (brb17502, brb07789) in LOS 10 were also induced strongly during 12 h, suggesting that three adjacent genes encoding a putative multidrug resistance protein (bll4319), probable RND efflux membrane fusion protein (bll4320), and putative outer membrane channel lipoprotein (bll4321) may act as an efflux system.Nine adjacent clones covering LOS 20 (bll7018–bll7032) were collectively and strongly induced by genistein, especially at 0.5 hpi (3.8- to 57.3-fold). Two adjacent clones (brb07276, brb06980) in this locus and two adjacent clones (brb06269, brb14218) covering LOS 9 contained 10 putatively induced genes during 12 h, and five among them (50.0%) encode transcriptional regulatory protein. Six adjacent genes (blr2437–blr2442) covered by LOS 7 encode ABC transporter-related protein, whereas five of six putatively induced genes (blr5790–blr5795) in LOS 16 encode unknown or hypothetical proteins.Contrarily, four loci (LOS 8, 11, 17, and 22) were repressed by both SSE and genistein during 12 h (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S4). Four adjacent genes encoding ABC transporter-related proteins (blr4553, blr4555–blr4557 in LOS 11), two adjacent genes encoding RhtB family transporter and two-component response regulator (bll7341 and bll7342 in LOS 22) and putative mono-oxygenase component (blr3679 in LOS 8) seemed to be repressed. However, all of six putatively repressed genes (blr5841–bll5846) in LOS17 encode hypothetical proteins.3.5. Validation of potentially regulated genesThe character of macroarray used in the experiment is that some clones are adjacently overlapped and each clone contains at least one gene. Thus, the putatively regulated genes were screened and validated with real-time RT–PCR according to the following strategies: (i) stringent selection of significantly up- and down-regulated clones, which had an expression ratio of >2.2- and <0.4-fold, respectively. The candidates were selected according to the distribution profiles of scatter plots and the area corresponding to them is shown in Fig. 5A (Scatter plots for SSE- or genistein-treated cells at 0.5 and 6 hpi are shown in Supplementary Fig. S5). (ii) Selection of putatively regulated genes from the clones as described before,23 and their validation by quantitative real-time RT–PCR.Scatter plots for the genome-wide expression of B. japonicum USDA 110 in response to SSE and genistein at 12 hpi, respectively.

Black and white areas indicate the ratio (%) (number in parentheses) of clones inside and outside symbiosis island, respectively. In this experiment, the thresholds of significantly up- and down-regulated clones had a signal ratio of >2.2- and <0.4-fold, respectively.As a result, 12 representative genes from some substantially regulated genomic loci (five genes in ECs, one gene in LISs, and six genes in LOSs) were selected and their relative amounts of transcripts were quantified by using real-time RT–PCR (Table 1). The primers of these selected genes were designed and confirmed as described in Section 2 (Supplementary Table S5). Among these 12 genes, genes encoding unknown protein (blr1649 in EC-I), RhcN (blr1816 in EC-III), and probable polygalacturonase (blr1993 in LIS 7) were exclusively up-regulated by SSE at 12 hpi (5.3- to 18.9-fold). The gene encoding ACC deaminase (blr0241 in the LOS 2) was also induced by SSE but the levels were maintained higher during 12 h (2.4- to 4.2-fold). Whereas, a gene encoding TtsI (bll1843 in EC-III) was induced by both SSE and genistein, but the levels were higher for SSE-treatment at 12 hpi (SSE: 10.1-fold; genistein: 4.1-fold). Genes encoding NodW (bll1714 in EC-II), NodC (blr2027 in EC-IV), and probable RND efflux membrane fusion protein (bll4320 in LOS10) were strongly induced by both SSE and genistein during 12 h, and the expression levels of blr2027 were maximal at 6 hpi (218.1- to 252.9-fold). One gene encoding transcriptional regulatory protein TetR family (blr7023 in LOS 20) was mainly induced by genistein.Validation of putatively up- and down-regulated genes by real-time RT–PCRaLocations of gene: SYM and OUT indicate inside and outside symbiosis island on the chromosome at coordinates 1681–2362 kb, respectively.

But, a gene encoding rhtB family transporter (bll7341 in LOS 22) was unsubstantially repressed by using real-time RT–PCR, although the clone covering this gene was significantly down-regulated in macroarray analyses. Relative expression levels seem to differ between real-time RT–PCR and macroarray analyses to some extent. However, the high correlation of the expression ratio (R2 = 0.90) between real-time RT–PCR and macroarray analyses showed the reliability of macroarray analyses with the validity of selection method for putatively induced genes.4. DiscussionIn this experiment, the symbiosis island of B. japonicum was collectively expressed as four predominant ECs (EC I–IV) in SSE-treated cells (Figs 1 and 2). The symbiosis island of M. loti MAFF303099 was also reported to be collectively expressed in bacteroids and function as clustered expression island (EI).23 However, each symbiosis island functions as different great ECs, such as nod and tts induced by SSE in this experiment, whereas nif, fix and fdx induced in bacteroids of M. loti MAFF303099. Genes cluster fixK2/fixLJ/fixNOPQ/fixGHIS (from bll2754 to bsr2773 at the coordinate 3,032,744-3,050,922), whose products are the oxygen-sensing cascade and the high-affinity terminal oxidase that are required for microaerobic respiration and nitrogen fixation in nodules,42 was not potentially expressed in this experiment (Fig. 1). Genome-wide expression analyses on these two rhizobia clearly demonstrate that the rhizobia genome is a vehicle for the symbiosis island, which function in distinctive gene clusters in the infection and differentiation stages of symbiosis.Despite approximately the same final concentration of genistein between SSE- and genistein-induction medium (4.7 and 5.0 µM) (Supplementary Fig. S4), SSE-treated cells exhibited a distinctive genome-wide expression profiling since a number of genomic loci were exclusively and strongly induced by SSE, e.g. genomic loci involved in TTSS, polygalacturonase, EPS synthesis, ACC deaminase, ribosome proteins, and energy metabolism. Unexpectedly, however, loci related to chemotaxis, such as cheAWYB (blr2192–blr2195) and cheR1WA (bll0390-bll0392-bll0393),16 were significantly repressed by SSE as well as genistein with time in this experiment (data not shown).The following plant infection test demonstrated that the number of the mature nodules formed in the root inoculated with SSE-pretreated cells was significantly enhanced (up to 12), compared with those formed with genistein-pretreated (six of mature nodules) as well as untreated cells (four of mature nodules) at 13 DAI (Supplementary Fig. S2). Besides, SSE-pretreated cells slightly promoted the fresh weight of both above-ground and roots of soybean at 10 and 13 DAI, compared with genistein-pretreated cells (Supplementary Fig. S3). It was reported that the infectiousness and competitiveness of B. japonicum cells for nodulation were stimulated by the pre-treatment with soybean meal extract and the slow-to-nodulate phenotype of a B. japonicum mutant was reversed by pre-incubation with soybean root extract.43,44 It is likely that these SSE-induced distinctive gene expressions of B. japonicum are responsible for such stimulation of nodulation abilities.It is clear that the expression of EC-III differed considerably between SSE- and genistein-treated cells within symbiosis island and its covered tts genes are induced later than common nod genes operon (in EC-IV) and nodW (in EC-II) (Figs 2 and 3). The tts genes were first reported to be induced later than most nod genes in R. sp.NGR234 and recently reported to be highly conserved in all Bradyrhizobium strain belonging to genomic group II.45,46 A model of regulatory cascade for B. japonicum has been recently proposed that many tts genes, which particularly possess a tts box upstream of each of them (Fig. 4), are genistein-inducible under the indirect control of nodD1nodD2nolA and nodW through a transcriptional activator of the two-component regulatory family (TtsI encoded by bll1843), resulting in the expression of tts later than most of nod genes. G. max was also reported to form similar nodule numbers but exhibited a delay in the nodule development with deletion mutants of several tts genes, especially bll1843.29 In this experiment, the expression profile of nodW was similar between SSE- and genistein-treated cells (Table 1). However, the locus covering gene nodD1nodD2nolA (clone 3 and 4 in EC-IV) as well as a gene bll1843 was induced stronger by SSE than genistein at 12 hpi (Fig. 4B and Table 1), suggesting that higher expression of tts is likely a result of integrated regulation of nodD1nodD2nolA rather than nodW by some compounds in SSE. It has been reported that the expression of tts in some pathogenic bacteria is controlled by environmental factors, such as temperature, nutrition, osmolarity, and quorum sensing.47 These results suggest that the stronger expression of tts is one reason for the enhanced nodule development of G. max inoculated with SSE-pretreated cells.Gene blr1993 encoding polygalacturonase, one of the plant cell wall-degrading enzymes, was reported to be strongly induced by genistein in a NodW-dependent manner, although the null mutant of this gene did not impair symbiosis with the host.37 In this experiment, however, it was not substantially induced by genistein (1.4 fold) but induced strongly by SSE (18.9 fold) at 12 hpi, and its expression occurred later than nod genes induction, suggesting that it seems to be tightly regulated. Recently, the expression of genes encoding plant cell wall-degrading enzymes including one polygalacturonase (pehB) as well as EPS in Ralstonia solanacearum was reported to be regulated in concert with type III secretion system.48 Another gene, blr0241 encoding ACC deaminase was induced by SSE during 12 h. This enzyme is likely involved in the reduction of ethylene concentration by degrading ACC, the precursor of ethylene biosynthesis in plant during the nodule formation process.23,49 Recently, blr0241 was also found to be well-induced in bacteroids,18 implying that this gene plays an important role during symbiotic process. Higher expression of genomic loci relevant to ribosomal proteins synthesis and energy metabolism by SSE seems to be reasonable, because SSE is rich in nutrients such as amino acids, organic acids, sugars, vitamins, etc,11 and advantageous to B. japonicum for the colonization in the rhizosphere of soybean.The SSE-induced loci shared with genistein-treated cells seem to be mainly caused by genistein in SSE. LOS 10 covering three adjacent genes for the multidrug resistance-related proteins (bll4319–bll4321) was induced by both SSE and genistein, in which bll4320 encoding a probable RND efflux membrane fusion protein was induced 7.4- to 28.8-fold during 12 h (Table 1). Moreover, LOS 10 was also induced by daidzein at 12 hpi (data not shown), suggesting that this locus is specifically involved in the isoflavonoid-inducible resistance of B. japonicum. The resistance of B. japonicum to phytoalexin such as glyceolin from soybean was reported to be induced by genistein and daidzein.50 In LOS 20, gene blr7023 encoding transcriptional regulatory TetR family was mainly induced by genistein during 12 h (3.6- to 8.0-fold). Besides, one clone (BJ7162) covering a single gene for a AcrB/AcrD/AcrF family protein (bll7019) was induced 2.6- to 33.3-fold by both SSE and genistein at 0.5 hpi (Supplementary Table S4), suggesting that this locus responds to genistein at the early stage and is also involved in the multidrug resistance of B. japonicum. These two loci are located far away from symbiosis island, but seem to play an important role in the competition of B. japonicum in the rhizosphere of soybean.Since SSE-supplemented medium contained daidzein (∼6.8 µM), the genome-wide expression of B. japonicum in response to daidzein (5.0 µM) at 12 hpi was also monitored. Nine clones covering nod genes such as nodWV (clone 15–16 in EC-II), common nodYABC operon (clone 2, 5, 6–8 in EC-IV) and noeI (clone 20 in EC-IV) inside symbiosis island were also induced by daidzein as well as genistein, although the induction levels by daidzein tended to be slightly lower than those by genistein (data not shown). These results indicate that daidzein is also a natural inducer of nod genes. It was reported that daidzein induced nod genes in B. japonicum.7 However, no potential regulation of LISs and LOSs except for the LOS 8–10, 12, 16, 19 was observed for daidzein-treated cells (data not shown), indicating that the exclusively regulated loci by SSE are not caused by daidzein.In combination with the time course of induction and validation of real-time PCR, the global expression profiles of loci in the presence of SSE were successfully captured in the experiment and it will be useful to identify novel genes relevant to the initial stage of symbiosis because bacterial genome are often organized into functional units. Nevertheless, it is important to keep in mind that the composition of SSE might be modified in the rhizosphere because it is known that microbes inhabiting rhizosphere influence the composition of plant-released compounds.11 In conclusion, the genome-wide expression analyses in this study reveal that symbiosis island functions as distinctive ECs in the initial stage of symbiosis, and that there are several loci which are exclusively regulated by SSE or shared between SSE- and genistein-treated cells. These findings will provide an insight into the mechanism of plant-microbe interaction by identifying the novel genes relevant to symbiosis.All information of the genes and clones described in this study is accessible in the Web database, RhizoBase, at http://www.kazusa.or.jp/rhizobase/, and http://orca10.bio.sci.osaka-u.ac.jp/array02/.FundingThis work was supported in part by the Tokachi Federation of Agricultural Cooperatives, Obihiro, Hokkaido, Japan, and the Sasakawa Scientific Research Grant from the Japan Science Society.

IntroductionPeriodontal disease, the major cause of tooth loss in the general populations of industrial nations,1,2 is a chronic inflammatory disease of the periodontium that leads to erosion of the attachment apparatus and supporting bone for teeth3 and is one of the most frequently occurring infectious diseases in humans.4 Recently, a number of epidemiological studies have shown significant relationships between periodontal diseases and cardiovascular diseases.5–8 Several periodontal pathogens, including Porphyromonas gingivalis, have been found in atherosclerotic plaques.9,10Porphyromonas gingivalis is a gram-negative anaerobic bacterium that is classified in the genus Porphyromonas, family Porphyromonadaceae, order Bacteroidales, class Bacteroides, phylum Bacteroidetes.11 The bacterium, which is often found in deep periodontal pockets of humans, is asaccharolytic and highly proteolytic. Porphyromonas gingivalis produces a broad array of potential virulence factors involved in tissue colonization and destruction as well as host defense perturbation. Potential virulence factors of P. gingivalis have been extensively described in several reviews.12–14 Among these, fimbriae (FimA fimbriae and Mfa1 fimbriae), which are responsible for attachment of bacterial cells to host cell surfaces, and proteolytic enzymes such as Arg-gingipain (Rgp) and Lys-gingipain (Kgp), which degrade various host proteins, have been studied in detail.15–17 However, no systematic analysis of P. gingivalis virulence factors has yet been carried out.Using the mouse subcutaneous soft tissue abscess model, P. gingivalis strains are divided into virulent and less-virulent strains. Virulent strains such as W83 typically induce a necrotic lesion at the site of injection within 24 h. An extending gangrene-like necrosis spreads, secondarily along fascial planes into the abdominal and thoracic areas between 24 and 48 h, producing a foul-smelling and bloody exudate under the animal's skin. Sloughing and scab formation from necrosis of the epidermis, weight and hair loss, and animal death from microbial sepsis also are common clinical features. Less-virulent strains such as ATCC 33277 produce only a localized abscess 3 days after subcutaneous inoculation.18 W83 has already been genome-sequenced.19 Strain ATCC 33277 is the type strain of P. gingivalis and has been widely used for characterization of pathophysiological features of the microorganism. We have used molecular genetic techniques to study P. gingivalis and have constructed a number of mutants from strain ATCC 33277 to investigate the roles of various genes in the pathogenicity of P. gingivalis.20–25 In the present study, we determined the whole genome sequence of strain ATCC 33277 and performed a genomic comparison of ATCC 33277 and W83. Our findings showed that extensive genome rearrangements have taken place between the two strains. Transposable elements appear to have played central roles in the generation of these genome rearrangements, which have in turn created many strain-specific genes, including several potentially virulence-related genes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Genome sequencingPorphyromonas gingivalis ATCC 33277 was obtained from the American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and has been kept for more than 20 years. Porphyromonas gingivalis W83 was obtained from Dr M. J. Duncan (Department of Molecular Genetics, The Forsyth Institute). Porphyromonas gingivalis GAI7802 was obtained from Dr E. Hoshino (Niigata University School of Dentistry), TDC60, TDC117, and TDC275 were obtained from Dr K. Ishihara (Tokyo Dental College), and SU63 was obtained from Dr M. Yoneda (Fukuoka Dental College). For preparing the genomic DNA, a single colony of each P. gingivalis strain was grown at 37°C anaerobically (10% CO2, 10% H2, 80% N2) in brain heart infusion broth (BD Bioscience, San Jose, CA, USA) supplemented with 5 µg of hemin and 0.5 µg of menadione per ml.The genomic DNA was randomly sheared by Hydroshear (GeneMachines) and used for genomic library construction. We prepared two pTS1-based random genomic libraries with insert sizes of 1–2 kb or ∼10 kb. Sequencing was carried out using BigDye v3.1 chemistry on ABI 3700 or ABI 3730 sequencers (Applied Biosystems) or ET chemistry on MegaBACE 4500 sequencers (GE Healthcare). The whole genome sequence was obtained by assembling 36 394 reads (9.5-fold coverage) from both shotgun libraries. The Phred/Phrap software package26 was used for base-calling, quality assessment, and sequence assembly. Assemblies were visualized for counting-based variations and detecting misassembly using Consed software.27 Numbers and lengths of the NotI fragments of the ATCC 33277 chromosome predicted from the determined nucleotide sequence agreed well with those observed in pulsed field gel electrophoresis analysis of NotI-digested ATCC 33277 genomic DNA.282.2. Sequence analysisProtein-coding sequences (CDSs) were identified by using the combination of GENOME GAMBLER v1.51,29 CRITICA,30 GENEHACKER,31 and GLIMMER v2.0 programs.32 The sequences of 3′ terminal regions of all 16S ribosomal RNA genes in W83, and ATCC 33277 were identical to that of Bacteroides fragilis (AGAAAGGAGG, the accession number M61006). Each CDS was thus reviewed manually for the presence of a start codon (ATG, TTG, or GTG) and a potential ribosome-binding sequence that should be related to a part of the AGAAAGGAGG sequence. Functional annotation of the CDSs was made on the basis of results of homology searches against public protein (nr) database from NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) by the BLASTP program.33 tRNA genes were identified by the tRNAscan-SE program.34 All-to-all BLASTP analysis of CDSs was performed between W83 and ATCC 33277 to identify conserved and strain-specific CDSs. Since each genome contained a number of multi-copied CDSs such as transposase genes, we first grouped these multi-copied CDSs in each genome using BLASTCLUST33 (The threshold used was ≥90% amino-acid sequence identity.). The largest CDS in each multi-copied CDS group was used as the representative of each group for the identification of conserved and strain-specific CDSs. In the present study, we defined conserved CDSs as ones that had 60–140% of the length of a query sequence and showed ≥90% sequence identity in bidirectional best-hit analysis. The MUMmer program35 was used to define conserved genomic regions, inversions, and translocations between the two genomes. The Pip Maker program36 was also used for DNA sequence alignment.2.3. PCR analysisThe total genomic DNA of ATCC 33277 and two pairs of PCR primers (CTnPg1-left and CTnPg1-right, CTnPg1-up and CTnPg1-down, Supplementary Table S1) were used to detect the excision of a conjugative transposon (CTn), CTnPg1. These primer pairs were designed to amplify the attP and attB regions for CTnPg1, respectively. PCR amplification was performed by using 100 ng of the genomic DNA and LA Taq (Takara Shuzo, Tokyo, Japan) in the following setting: preheating (94°C for 1 min) and 30 cycles of DNA denaturation (94°C for 20 s), primer annealing (55°C for 30 s) and DNA extension (68°C for 2 min). The amplified fragments were subjected to direct sequencing to determine the nucleotide sequences of the attP and attB sites.2.4. RNA isolation and real-time PCRPorphyromonas gingivalis cells were grown to the mid-exponential phase. Total RNA was isolated from the harvested cells using an RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen Sciences, Valencia, CA, USA) and reverse-transcribed in a reaction mixture containing a random primer (Promega Co., Madison, WI, USA), dNTP mixture, RNase inhibitor (Wako Pure Chemical Industries, Ltd., Osaka, Japan), dithiothreitol, Superscript II (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA), and DEPC-treated water. Real-time quantitative PCR was performed using Full Velocity SYBR Green QPCR Master Mix (Stratagene, La Jolla, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Primer sequences for the real-time PCR are listed in Supplementary Table S1. PCR amplification was performed in the following setting: preheating (95°C for 5 min) and 30 cycles of DNA denaturation (95°C for 10 s), and primer annealing/DNA extension (60°C for 30 s). The expression level of each targeted gene was normalized to that of the 16S rRNA gene. The comparative cycle threshold method37 was used for relative quantification.2.5. Nucleotide sequence accession numbersThe fully annotated genome sequence of P. gingivalis strain ATCC 33277 has been deposited in GenBank/EMBL/DDBJ databases under the accession number AP009380. Nucleotide sequences of the glucose kinase-encoding genes (glk) of five P. gingivalis strains have been deposited under the accession numbers AB293447 (strain TDC60), AB293448 (TDC117), AB293449 (TDC275), AB293450 (SU63), and AB293451 (GAI7802).3. Results and discussion3.1. General features of the ATCC 33277 genomeThe genome of ATCC 33277 comprised a single circular chromosome of 2 354 886 bp with an average G + C content of 48.4% (Fig. 1). The size was almost the same as that of W83 (2 343 476 bp). The ATCC 33277 genome contained 2090 CDSs (PGN No.) with an average size of 970 bp, covering 86.1% of the whole chromosome sequence. It contained 4 RNA operons (rrn, 5S rRNA-23S rRNA-tRNAAla-tRNAIle-16S rRNA) and 53 tRNA genes that provide specificity for all kinds of amino acids. The numbers of rrn operons and tRNA genes were identical to those of W83. By the χ2 analysis, we identified 13 regions with atypical nucleotide composition on the ATCC 33277 chromosome (Fig. 1, 8th circle). Many genes in the regions exhibited higher similarity to the genes in other bacterial species such as B. fragilis than those in strain W83, suggesting that they have been introduced to ATCC 33277 by horizontal gene transfer.Circular map of the chromosome of P. gingivalis strain ATCC 33277.

Strain-specific CDSsTo more precisely compare the CDS sets encoded on the ATCC 33277 and W83 genomes, we reannotated CDSs on the W83 genome by the same criteria as those used for ATCC 33277. We detected 114 CDSs (PGa No.) in the W83 genome that had not been annotated by Nelson et al.19 They included many fragments of transposases of insertion sequences (ISs) but at least 27 function-assignable genes, such as those for translocase SecE subunit, pseudouridine synthases, and lysine-specific cysteine proteinase (Supplementary Table S2). In total, we identified 2023 CDSs in W83.ATCC 33277 and W83 genomes had a number of multi-copied CDSs such as those for IS transposases. ATCC 33277 and W83 contained 53 and 32 multi-copied CDS groups, respectively; the gene products of each group exhibited ≥90% amino-acid sequence identity (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). In bidirectional best-hit analysis to identify conserved CDSs between the two strains, we used the largest CDS in each multi-copied CDS group as the representative of each group. By the analysis, we identified 1490 conserved CDSs, 461 ATCC 33277-specific CDSs, and 415 W83-specific CDSs. The strain-specific CDSs are listed in Supplementary Tables S5 and S6, respectively.Most of the strain-specific CDSs encoded hypothetical proteins of unknown functions, but function-predictable W83-specific CDSs included several genes that may be related to the higher virulence of the strain, such as those for glycosyltransferase (PG0110), a protein required for capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis (PG0111), sensor histidine kinase (PG0719), surface antigen PgaA (PG0742), and thiol protease (PG1055). The two strains encoded different sets of DNA restriction-modification system proteins.3.3. CTn and transposonATCC 33277 contained a variety of mobile genetic elements. We found four copies of CTns that were absent in W83 (Fig. 2). CTnPg1-a is 44.3 kb in size and encodes 50 CDSs (PGN_0046 to PGN_0095), including a set of genes for conjugative transfer and integration as well as those for an Na+-driven multi-drug efflux pump. Several genes showed moderate sequence homologies to the genes of CTns of Bacteroides species.38–40 CTnPg1-b, which is 9.7 kb in size and encodes 15 CDSs (PGN_1281 to PGN_1295), is identical to a part of CTnPg1-a (PGN_0046 to PGN_0060). One end of CTnPg1-b has been disrupted by multiple IS insertions. We identified two additional CTns, CTnPg2 and CTnPg3, but both were also truncated and highly degraded by multiple IS insertions.Novel CTns and Tn identified in the ATCC 33277 genome.

Black triangles in CTnPg1-a and CTnPg1-b indicate direct repeat sequences, and black boxes in TnPg17 MITEs. The regions of CTnPg1-a and CTnPg1-b indicated by gray shading have an identical sequence.We identified two identical copies of a novel composite transposon (Tn) named TnPg17-a and TnPg17-b in the ATCC 33277 genome. TnPg17 is 16.8 kb in size and has ISPg3 at both ends. Target site duplications of 4 and 7 bp were found for TnPg17-a and TnPg17-b, respectively. TnPg17 carries genes for a tetR family transcriptional regulator, ABC transporter ATP-binding proteins, and a carboxyl-terminal processing protease.3.4. IS and miniature inverted-repeat transposable elementA total of 93 IS elements (including 38 partial copies) and 48 miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) (including 18 partial copies) were found in ATCC 33277 (Table 1). The IS elements identified were classified into six types, ISPg1–ISPg6, all of which are also present in W83.19 MITEs comprise a group of small mobile genetic elements and are massively amplified often in plants.41 They do not encode transposases by themselves but have terminal inverted repeats (TIRs) that are the same as or very similar to those of some IS elements, and they are thus transposable by the action of transposase provided in trans by the cognate IS element. In ATCC 33277, we identified three types of MITEs, MITE239, MITE700, and MITE464, all of which have also been identified on the W83 genome.19 The structure of MITE239 was well conserved between the copies, 239 bp in length and with the same TIR as that of ISPg3. However, MITE700 and MITE464 exhibited highly variable structures, and their structural features have not been described in detail in the previous report.19 Therefore, we first determined the structural features of these two MITEs by comparing the sequences of all of the MITE700 and MITE464 copies identified in ATCC 33277.IS elements and MITEs on the ATCC 33277 and W83 genomesaDetermined based on the reannotated W83 data.IS elements and MITEs on the ATCC 33277 and W83 genomesaDetermined based on the reannotated W83 data.MITE700 also contains the same TIRs as those of ISPg3, but its internal sequence is not related to that of MITE239. We identified 14 copies of MITE700 (including seven partial copies) in ATCC 33277. Multiple sequence alignment analysis revealed that MITE700 is ∼720 bp in length but exhibits a high sequence variation due to internal deletions/insertions. The sequence of a region located just downstream of the left TIR is highly variable between the copies. We identified three subtypes of MITE700 based on the sequence variation in this region (Supplementary Fig. S1).MITE464 has the same TIRs as those of ISPg1. We found that its internal sequence consists of three types of repeat sequences (referred to as Repeats A, B, and C) (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S2). Repeats A and B exist just inside both TIRs, constituting a direct-repeat-like structure. Between the two Repeat A/B regions, multiple Repeat C regions exist in tandem, but the number of Repeat C regions varies between MITE464 copies, up to 14 repeats. Since no such repeating structure has been found in any MITEs described so far, we propose a new name for this MITE, MITEPgRS (MITE of P. gingivalis with Repeating Sequences).MITE in P. gingivalis with Repeating Structure (MITEPgRS). (A) Schematic presentation of the consensus structure of MITEPgRS and the structures of 20 copies of MITEPgRS identified in the ATCC 33277 genome are shown.

(B) Consensus sequences of Repeats A, B, and C are shown.On the basis of the structural features of each MITE, we rescreened IS elements and MITEs on the W83 genome, and we identified 93 IS elements (including 51 partial ones) and 35 MITEs (including nine partial ones) (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S7). The total numbers of IS elements and MITEs of the two strains were very similar, but the compositions showed a significant difference. In ATCC 33277, ISPg1, ISPg3, and MITE239 have been significantly expanded, whereas no intact copies of ISPg4 and ISPg5 are present. A previous study also showed that the numbers of copies and insertion sites of ISPg1 (formerly IS1126) markedly varied among P. gingivalis strains.42 The composition of IS elements and MITEs may be an important feature to distinguish strains of P. gingivalis.3.5. Genome rearrangementWhole genome sequence alignment analysis by using the MUMmer program revealed that extensive genomic rearrangements have taken place between ATCC 33277 and W83 (Fig. 4). A number of X-shaped structures were observed, indicating that symmetrical inversions repeatedly occurred around the replication axis. We identified a total of 175 genomic regions in which genomic rearrangements took place in either strain. Inversions or translocations were observed in 35 regions, and simple insertions, deletions, or replacements were observed in 140 regions. Remarkably, about two-thirds of these genomic rearrangements were associated with the presence of mobile genetic elements (IS, MITE, Tn, CTn, and a not well-defined large mobile element of W83). Large inversions or translocations have occurred between two rrn operons, duplicated DNA regions coding for a histone-like family DNA-binding protein (PGN_0614 and PGN_1407), a hypothetical protein (PGN_0615 and PGN_1406), elongation factor P (PGN_0616 and PGN_1405), two identical 11 bp sequences (TAATCATAATA), and two similar 12/13 bp sequences (TTTTC(GCC/AATG)AAAA). DNA sequences similar to the 12/13 bp sequences were also present in the att sites for CTnPg1 described in the following section. These rearrangements appear to be deeply involved in the generation of strain-specific CDSs: 60% of ATCC 33277-specific CDSs and 68% of W83-specific CDSs were created by these genomic rearrangements.The DNA sequence identity plot of P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 and W83 chromosomes. The dnaA gene is located at the left and bottom corner. Black circles indicate mobile genetic elements (CTn Tn, IS, MITE, or a not-well-defined large mobile element of W83).

By comparing the rrn operon-flanking regions in the two strains, we found that an inversion had taken place between rrn1 and rrn4 (see Supplementary Fig. S3). Additional genomic rearrangements that have occurred in the genomic loci other than rrn operons further altered the relative locations of the four rrn operons on the two genomes. We analyzed the structures of rrn operon-flanking regions in five other strains of P. gingivalis (TDC60, TDC117, TDC275, SU63, and GAI7802) using a set of orientation-specific primer pairs, and we found that all of the rrn operon-flanking regions of these five strains have the same structures as those of ATCC 33277 (Supplementary Fig. S3). This result suggests that inversions between rrn1 and rrn4 have taken place specifically in the W83 strain lineage among the strains tested.The genomic regions for the biosynthesis of cell surface molecules have also significantly diverged between the two strains. They included the regions for FimA fimbrilin, Mfa1 fimbrilin, capsular polysaccharides, RagA and RagB antigens, and glycosyl transferase.42–45 Among these, the difference in the locus for capsular polysaccharide biosynthesis (GP1 locus) is particularly important because capsular polysaccharide is known to be one of the major virulence factors of P. gingivalis. The GP1 locus of ATCC 33277 (PGN_0223-PGN_0236) is identical to that reported for strain 38143 except that one nonsense mutation was found in the PGN_0223-homolog of strain 381 (Supplementary Fig. S4).The clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) locus also exhibits notable structural difference between the two strains. The numbers of repeats in the repeat/spacer region of the CRISPR-30-36 locus are 120 in ATCC 33277 and 23 in W83 (Fig. 5). The nucleotide sequences of the repeats are identical, but there is no homology in the spacer regions. A part of the CRISPR-associated gene (cas) encoding region has been replaced by very different sequences. Of interest is that the gene organization of the cas-encoding region of ATCC 33277 is nearly identical to that of B. fragilis YCH46 but very different from that of W83. The gene products also exhibit a high level of similarity of amino-acid sequences to those of B. fragilis YCH46. These results suggest that these genes may have been horizontally transferred between P. gingivalis and B. fragilis.Comparison of CRISPR-30-36 regions of P. gingivalis and B. fragilis.

The identity between PGN_1964 and PG2016 is 15.7%.Among the bacterial species so far sequenced, Bacteroides species are phylogenically most closely related to P. gingivalis. However, two sequenced B. fragilis strains show no such extensive genomic rearrangement as seen in P. gingivalis.40,46Shigella flexneri, a pathogen for dysentery, contains a large number of IS elements and the bacterium has induced extensive genomic rearrangements among strains, which may create differences in virulence and epidemicity.47,48 In P. gingivalis, the genomic rearrangements induced by IS and other mobile genetic elements may also have been involved in the generation of strain-to-strain difference in virulence. In this context, a recent finding that treatment of P. gingivalis cells with H2O2 induces expression of the ISPg1 transposase gene is noteworthy.49 The fact that the number of copies of ISPg1 varies among P. gingivalis strains and the fact that ISPg1 is frequently associated with genome rearrangements suggest that oxidative stress-induced expression of the ISPg1 transposase gene results in transposition of ISPg1 that may mediate genomic rearrangements in P. gingivalis, and such rearrangements may contribute to the adaptation of P. gingivalis strains to an oxygen concentration-changeable environment in the gingival crevice.3.6. Excision of CTnPg1We could not exactly determine the attachment (att) site of CTnPg1 by comparing the genome sequences of ATCC 33277 and W83 because integration of CTnPg1-a has induced a genomic rearrangement and half of CTnPg1-b has been deleted. We therefore examined whether CTnPg1 can be excised from the chromosome and form a circular intermediate. By PCR analysis of the chromosomal DNA of ATCC 33277 using two primers targeting the left and right ends of CTnPg1 (Fig. 6A), we obtained a PCR product of 1500 bp in size (Fig. 6B). We further investigated whether a cast-off genome can be generated by the excision of CTnPg1 using two PCR primers targeting the CTnPg1-a-flanking regions, and we obtained a PCR product of 1000 bp in size (Fig. 6A and B). By comparing the sequences of the two PCR products with the genome sequence of ATCC 33277, we identified the core sequence of the att site for CTnPg1, ATTTTCA(CA/TT)GAAAA (Fig. 6C). The same sequence was also found at one end of CTnPg1-b.Excision of CTnPg1-a.

Glucose kinase-encoding geneDisability of saccharolysis is one of the major characteristics of P. gingivalis. Consistent with this, the glucose kinase-encoding gene (glk) (PG1737) has a nonsense mutation in strain W83 (Supplementary Fig. S5). Nelson et al.19 suggested that the defect of glk accounts for asaccharolysis of P. gingivalis. In ATCC 33277, the glk gene (PGN_0380) has also been disrupted by an insertion of MITE239 but contains no nonsense mutation. Therefore, we analyzed the glk genes of other P. gingivalis strains to know which type of genetic defect is generally observed in P. gingivalis. Unexpectedly, however, the glk genes of five strains examined (strains TDC60, TDC117, TDC275, SU63, and GAI7802) were all intact. We detected no nonsense mutation or MITE239 insertion although a few amino-acid substitutions were observed in these glk genes (Supplementary Fig. S5B). To determine whether the glk gene is expressed in the five strains, we quantified the mRNA of the glk gene using the Kgp-encoding gene (kgp) as a control (Supplementary Table S8). In this analysis, a large amount of the glk gene transcript was detected in all of the five strains. On the other hand, all the strains used in this study (ATCC 33277, W83, and five other strains) were confirmed to be asaccharolytic (data not shown). Thus, these data suggest that defects of glk, which were detected in W83 and ATCC 33277, cannot always account for asaccharolysis of P. gingivalis. Further work is needed to clarify physiological roles of glucose kinase in P. gingivalis and what is responsible for asaccharolysis of P. gingivalis.3.8. ConclusionIn this study, we determined the whole genome sequence of ATCC 33277, a less-virulent P. gingivalis strain, and carried out a genomic comparison with a virulent strain, W83. Although the genome size and GC content are almost the same, we detected extensive rearrangements between the two strains, many of which have been induced by various mobile genetic elements (IS, MITE, Tn, and CTn). Such structural alterations of the P. gingivalis genomes generated many strain-specific CDSs and may be closely associated with difference in virulence of the two strains.FundingThis work was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas “Comprehensive Genomics” (No. 17020007) to M.H.; “Applied Genomics” (No. 18018032) to K.N. from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of Japan.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.We thank K.

IntroductionFabaceae is the third largest family of flowering plants, comprising 650 genera and 18 000 species with a variety of characteristics; many of which have long been targets of breeding because of their agronomic and industrial importance. Among them, a few species have been chosen as ‘model legumes’ for use in genetic and physiological studies. Lotus japonicus is a typical model legume with the characteristics of a short life cycle (2–3 months), self-fertility, and a relatively simple genome architecture of diploidy (n = 6), i.e. small in size, 472 Mb. Mutants in various biological phenomena specific to legumes such as symbiotic nitrogen fixation, and those common to flowering plants such as flower morphogenesis, have been characterized and the genes responsible have been isolated and further studied. The availability of the Agrobacterium-mediated DNA transformation system and genomic resources including a large number of expressed sequences tag (EST)/cDNA clones,1 high-density genetic linkage maps,2–4 and partial genome sequences5–9 has played an essential role in this process.The whole-genome sequences of two plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana (Cruciferae) and Oryza sativa (Poaceae), have drastically accelerated research into their genetic systems by providing investigators with both gene sequences and positional information. However, the process of high-accuracy sequencing is expensive and labor intensive since physical maps are created and a large number of individual BAC clones are used as templates. In contrast, draft sequencing according to the whole-genome shotgun approach in combination with BAC end sequencing generates information about the general genome structure at a fairly reasonable cost, but the resulting data are rather fragmentary and need an additional effort to be connected with physical/genetic maps. In this study, we aimed to analyze the genome structure of L. japonicus to reveal gene and genome features that are characteristic of legume plants. For this purpose, we adopted various established technologies including genomic library construction, DNA sequencing, fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), genetic mapping and bioinformatics in such a way that the advantages of each technology were combined in a cost-effective manner. Here, we report the first whole-genome structure of the legume, L. japonicus, its characteristic genome features, and a variety of information and material resources that were developed during this study.2. Material and methods2.1. Plant and DNA materialsLotus japonicus accession Miyakojima MG-20 was provided by Masayoshi Kawaguchi, University of Tokyo.10 Transformation-competent artificial chromosome (TAC) genomic libraries were constructed according to standard methods as described previously.5 BAC genomic libraries were constructed using the genomic DNA of L. japonicus accession MG-20 partially digested with either Sau3AI or EcoRI and pBeloBAC as a cloning vector. The average insert size of these libraries was 104 kb for the Sau3AI library and 101 and 88 kb for two independent preparations of EcoRI libraries. Both libraries covered the haploid genome 8.4 times in total.The seeds and genomic libraries can be obtained from LegumeBase supported by the National BioResource Project (http://www.legumebase.agr.miyazaki-u.ac.jp/index.jsp).2.2. Genome sequencing and assemblyTwo types of sequencing approaches were combined to sequence the L. japonicus genome: clone-by-clone sequencing and shotgun sequencing of selected regions of the genome.TAC/BAC clones were selected from the genomic libraries as seed points using the sequence information from ESTs and cDNA markers from L. japonicus and other legumes. The nucleotide sequence of each clone was determined according to the shotgun strategy with three to five times redundancy. A total of 1909 TAC/BAC clones, those newly sequenced in this study and those that had been sequenced previously,5–9 were assembled into 954 scaffolds using the Paracel Genome Assembler (PGA; version 2.6.2, Paracel Co., 2002), followed by manual TAC/BAC end-pair scaffolding, resulting in high-quality genomic sequence (HGS) contigs.In parallel, shotgun sequencing of a selected TAC mixture (STM) enriched in gene spaces and a whole genomic DNA from which highly repetitive and organelle genomic sequences were subtracted (selected genomic regions, SGRs) was carried out. The TAC clones, neither end sequence of which hit repetitive or organelle genomic sequences in the L. japonicus genome, were selected from the libraries, pooled, and subjected to shotgun sequencing. For the SGRs, a genomic library with an average insert size of 2.5 kb was generated using pBluescript SK− as the cloning vector. For subtraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-amplified fragments of LjTR1 were biotinylated using Biotin-High Prime (Roche, Basel, Switzerland) and used as a driver in subtractive hybridization with the WGS library. The WGS library was single-stranded prior to hybridization by combined action of gene II and exonuclease III. Hybrids were removed using Dynabeads M-280 Streptavidin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) and the remaining single-stranded WGS library was double-stranded using Klenow fragments (Takara Bio, Japan) and transformed into host E. coli ElectroTen-Blue (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA).A total of 808 816 reads from STM generated from 4603 TAC inserts and 847 513 SGR reads were assembled into a set of 109 986 contigs, 147 805 446 bp in length (selected genome assembly, SGA) by the Arachne assembler, version 2.01.11 The SGA sequences were then subjected to assemble with the HGS, and finally, a total of 110 940 supercontigs with a total coverage of 315 073 275 tentative genomic sequence (TGS) bases were obtained.2.3. Linkage mappingTwo types of PCR-based DNA marker, SSLP and dCAPS, were generated using the sequence information in order to locate sequence contigs on the genetic linkage map, as described previously.5 The analysis of segregation data for SSR and dCAPS markers and linkage map integration were carried out using the F2 mapping population of accessions Miyakojima MG-20 and Gifu B-129, which were previously used for construction of the fine genetic linkage map.22.4. Fluorescent in situ hybridizationThe 26S rDNA, 5S rDNA, and TAC clones were used as probes for FISH analysis. The 26S and the 5S rDNA probes were produced by PCR using primer pairs that were designed based on the rRNA and 5S RNA gene sequences in the L. japonicus genome.The FISH analysis using rRNA genes and TAC clones was performed on well-prepared chromosome spreads according to the method described previously.12 The preparations were observed under a fluorescence microscope (OLYMPUS BX50) equipped with a sensitive cooled CCD camera (PXL1400), and the pro-metaphase chromosome spreads with clear patterns were photographed using blue or green light excitation and emission filters. Captured images were digitally stored in a computer and analyzed using CHIAS3 imaging software.132.5. Repetitive sequencesRepetitive elements in the TGS were identified by comparing all of the contig units, HGS and those produced from the STM and SGRs, each using BLASTN14,15 and processing the outputs using the RECON program.16 A total of 214 consensus sequences of repetitive elements that appeared at least 20 times were identified. The consensus sequences of these elements were subjected to a similarity search against known repeat elements in the RepBase (http://www.girinst.org/). For the consensus sequences with features of Class I or II transposable elements (TEs), full-length candidate sequences were identified by comparing 10 kb upstream and downstream of the corresponding genomic regions to find long terminal repeats or terminal inverted repeats. For unclassified consensus sequences, the longest representative sequences were selected by comparing the corresponding genome sequences using the CLUSTALW multiple alignment program. Full-length elements of TE and representative sequences of unclassified repeats were collected into a repeat sequence library along with the previously reported TE sequences17 and used as references for RepeatMasker (www.repeatmasker.org) analysis to delineate the occurrence of these elements in the total TGS and TAC/BAC end sequences.2.6. Assignment of RNA-encoding genesIn order to identify the potential RNA-encoding genes, a structural RNA sequence library was extracted from GenBank,18 and searched for homologous sequences in the L. japonicus genome with the use of the BLASTN function in BLAST. Transfer RNA genes were predicted using tRNAscan-SE, version 1.4,19 in a eukaryotic mode with default parameters. Genes for small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and 7S large nucleolar RNAs (LRNAs) were predicted using SnoScan20 with a yeast model and srpSCAN,21 respectively. A total of 93 genes for small nuclear RNAs including those for 21 U1, 19 U2, 7 U4, 23 U5, 21 U6, and 2 U12 were identified based on their similarity to known genes.Candidates for miRNA precursors were identified by a search using the Arabidopsis mature miRNA sequences, which were retrieved from the miRNA Registry database (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/mirna/).22 The L. japonicus genome and EST sequences were searched for sequence patterns that are characteristic of miRNA using the FUZZNUC program that is available at EMBOSS (http://emboss.sourceforge.net/) with the permission of a maximum of two nucleotide mismatches. A stem-loop structure was searched within a distance of 500 nucleotides from the coding region of the mature miRNA based on the finding that the longest Arabidopsis thaliana precursor sequences identified to date are 411 nucleotides long.23 Target genes of the miRNA candidates were searched in the coding sequences (CDS) and 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs) of the presumptive genes assigned in the TGS.2.7. Assignment of protein-encoding genesTentative genomic sequence was subjected to gene prediction and modeling by the Kazusa Annotation PipelinE for Lotus japonicus (KAPSEL).5 The KAPSEL employs ab initio gene-finding software and similarity searches in order to generate the elements for gene model production. The ab initio gene-finding software used in the pipeline includes GeneMark.hmm,24 Genscan25 and Grail26 using the A. thaliana-trained matrix. Splice-site candidates were deduced by NetGene227 and SplicePredictor.28 The similarity searches to detect potential protein-coding exons were performed using the BLASTX function of BLAST against the UniProtKB database.29 The assigned exon candidates were extracted from the original sequence library, then mapped on the TGS more precisely using the dps and nap programs in the program suite of the analysis and annotation tool (AAT) package.30 Similarity searches of transcript sequences were performed by aligning the TGS against the Gene Indices31 for legume species including L. japonicus, M. truncatula and Glycine max. The assigned transcript sequences were mapped on the TGS using the dds and gap2 programs in AAT to confirm working models of protein-encoding genes. As a result of the automated annotation process, a total of 19 848 partial and 10 951 complete models were assigned as protein-encoding genes in the TGS, except for those related to TEs. The 76.4-Mb sequences in the HGS were edited and annotated manually to ensure high-quality gene prediction.The genes thus assigned were denoted by IDs with the clone (LjT**** for TACs and LjB**** for BACs) or contig (CM****) names followed by sequential numbers from one end to another. Of these, manually annotated genes on the HGS were followed by “.nc”, and others were followed by “.nd”. The genes assigned on the SGA sequences were denoted by IDs with the assemble consensus names (LjSGA_****) followed by sequential numbers from one end to another in the insert.A global alignment of the genome sequences and ESTs was performed using the NEEDLE program32,33 that is provided at the EMBOSS site (http://emboss.sourceforge.net/). To identify a possible TATA box-like motif for recognition by RNA polymerase II, a search against the plant cis-acting regulatory DNA elements (PLACE) database34 (http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/) was carried out.2.8. Similarity and domain searchesFunctional annotation for deduced L. japonicus proteins was performed by a similarity search against the genes of known function and a domain analysis. The similarity search was performed using the gapped BLASTP function of BLAST against the UniProtKB database and protein-encoding genes deduced in A. thaliana,35 rice,36Populus trichocarpa,37 and grapevine.38 For the analysis of gene families and functional domains, the predicted proteome was searched against InterPro.39 InterPro annotations were assigned to each functional motif and domain, and then the annotation information was translated into GO functional descriptions.40 GO descriptions were grouped into the GOslim categories of molecular function and biological process. Subcellular localization of targeting signals and transmembrane helices of deduced protein-coding genes were predicted using the following programs: PSORT,41 TargetP,42 and SOSUI.432.9. Synteny analysisSynteny was detected by identifying arrays of predicted protein-encoding genes between target genomic regions. Translated amino acid sequences of the products of genes assigned on the mapped TGS were compared with those in the reference genomes, and a BLASTP E-value of <1e−20 was considered to be significant. Synteny blocks were surveyed on the basis of physically linked sequence units such as contigs and singlet clones. A synteny block was defined as the region where three or more conserved homologs were located within a 100-kb DNA stretch in the two genomes.3. Results and discussion3.1. Genome sequencingPreliminary random and TAC end sequencing revealed the presence of various types of repetitive sequences in the L. japonicus genome. The FISH analysis showed that some of these sequences were distributed along the entire genome with occasional condensation to different extents, strongly suggesting that the gene spaces are intermingled with repeated sequences. In order to efficiently obtain sequence information for the gene space, we combined two independent approaches: clone-by-clone sequencing from seed points of the genome and shotgun sequencing of both STM enriched in gene spaces and a whole-genomic DNA from which highly repetitive and organelle genome sequences were subtracted (SGRs).A total of 1314 TAC and BAC clones were selected based on the sequences of ESTs, cDNA and gene information from L. japonicus and other legumes, and an additional 584 TAC and BAC clones were selected by overlaps. Their nucleotide sequences were determined according to the shotgun method with three to five times redundancy (Supplementary Table S1). Further assembly of the sequences of the 1898 clones produced 954 supercontigs with a total length of 167 267 829 bp. Among these sequences, 76 366 532 bp (46%) covered by 823 clones were Phase 3 sequences (HGS). In parallel, 4603 TAC clones, neither ends of which hit the repetitive sequences, were pooled and subjected to shotgun sequencing. Assembly of 808 816 STM random sequences and 847 513 SGR sequences, the sum of which was estimated to give 2.4 times the genome coverage, generated an additional 109 986 contigs that were 147 805 446 bp long in total (SGA). The efficiency of the STM and SGR approaches was indicated by the ratio of centrometic and heterochromatic repeat sequences in SGA sequences, which was about one-fifth of that in TAC/BAC end sequences (Supplementary Fig. S1). The total length of the determined sequences (TGS) amounted to 315 073 275 bp (Supplementary Table S2). Although the TGS corresponded to 67% of the reported L. japonicus genome (472 Mb),44 it can be estimated that the TGS covers 91.3% of the gene space because 11 404 out of 12 485 collections of tentative consensus (TC) sequences of the L. japonicus Gene Index provided by the Gene Index Project (http://compbio.dfci.harvard.edu/tgi/plant.html) were located on the TGS. TGS was used as standard information for further analysis of gene structure and function in L. japonicus in this study.3.2. Construction of the sequence-tagged genetic linkage mapIn order to anchor the obtained genomic sequences to the genetic linkage map, DNA markers were developed for the sequenced TAC and BAC clones, and genetic mapping was carried out. As a result, a total of 788 microsatellite and 80 derived cleaved amplified polymorphic sequences (dCAPS) markers were generated and mapped onto the six linkage groups, which resulted in anchoring of the HGS and the connecting TAC/BAC and SGR sequences onto the linkage map. In total, 594 supercontigs containing 130 251 279 bp, corresponding to 41% of the TGS, were anchored onto the genetic linkage map (Supplementary Table S1).Authenticity of the above genetic linkage map was examined by FISH. TAC clones genetically mapped at distal and proximal positions to the linkage groups were used as probes for hybridization. As shown in Fig. 1, all of the clones examined were successfully located at the expected positions on the corresponding chromosomes. For chromosome 5, four clones were positioned inversely in the expected order on the genetic linkage map; therefore, we revised the marker order of the genetic map. Genetic and physical distances did not agree very well, as reported in A. thaliana and rice.35,36FISH detection and the integration map of L. japonicus.

The length ratio among six chromosomes was adjusted to the ratio of pachytene chromosomes.The positions of centromeres were deduced by cytological features in both prometaphase and pachytene chromosomes and were further confirmed by FISH analysis using the pericentromere-specific retroelement LjRE2 (described later) as a probe (Fig. 1). TAC clones genetically mapped at distal positions of each linkage group were located on the telomeric regions of all the chromosomes by FISH with the exception of the bottom of chromosome 4 and the top of chromosome 6 (Fig. 1). However, none of these clones and the extending sequences contained the consensus telomeric repeat, CCCTAAA.45 Small condensed structures were observed at most of the telomeric regions of the chromosomes.44 The presence of such heterochromatic regions may have prevented the extension of the analyzed sequences to the telomeric repeat. Indeed, a short tandem repeat sequence, LjTR4, specific to the subtelomeric region was found on the contig (CM0105) at the bottom of chromosome 1, where no telomeric condentation was observed.443.3. Repetitive sequencesA total of 33 730 di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide simple sequence repeats (SSRs) that were equal to or longer than 15 bp were identified in the TGS (Supplementary Table S3). Provided that the size of the TGS is 315 Mb, the frequency of occurrence of the above SSRs was estimated to be one SSR in every 9.3 kb. Di-, tri-, and tetra-nucleotide SSRs accounted for 48.6, 44.4, and 7.0% of the identified SSRs, respectively. The SSR patterns that appeared frequently were (AT)n, (AAG)n, and (AAAT)n, each representing 63% of di-, 28% of tri-, and 46% of tetra-nucleotide repeat units. The tri-nucleotide SSRs, particularly (GGT)n and (GGA)n, were preferentially found in exons. (AG)n was enriched in 5′ and 3′ UTRs, and (AC)n frequently occurred in 5′ and 3′ UTRs and introns (Supplementary Table S3).A search using the repeat sequence finding program RECON14 against the TGS unraveled the occurrence of a variety of repeat elements including Class I and Class II TE subfamilies and those that are difficult to classify into known subfamilies (Table 1). Over 35 000 copies of miniature-inverted repeat TEs (MITEs) were identified, which were classified into more than 60 types. A substantial portion of these MITEs was found in introns and UTRs. A short insert size Class I retroelement, a member of the short-interspersed nucleotide elements, was also preferentially observed in introns and the 3′ UTRs (Supplementary Table S4).46Repetitive sequences in the L. japonicus TGSRepetitive sequences in the L. japonicus TGSAs TGS were enriched in sequences from the gene-rich euchromatic regions, we used less biased TAC end sequences to survey the highly repetitive sequences in the entire genome of L. japonicus. By clustering 37 000 TAC end sequences, 34 types of highly repetitive sequences, each of which appeared in more than 50 end sequences, could be identified. These included five short tandem repeats with a repeat unit ranging from 172 to 333 bp (LjTR1 to 5), two retroelements (LjRE1 and 2) and nine unclassified repeats (LjUR1 to 9), one of which is the centromere-associated sequence Ljcen1 (GenBank accession no. AF390569) reported previously by Pedrosa et al.45 The FISH analysis showed that LjRE2 was present exclusively in the pericentromeric heterochromatic regions, while LjRE1 was distributed along the entire chromosomes (Supplementary Fig. S2), and that LjTR1 was localized in highly condensed heterochromatic regions of the genome known as the chromosome knobs (Supplementary Fig. S2).3.4. Genes encoding non-coding RNAsA combination of prediction and similarity searches against the TGS identified 638 transfer RNA genes corresponding to 49 species of anticodons (Supplementary Table S5), which are sufficient for coding all of the amino acids in the universal codon table. In addition, two complete units of 18S–5.8S–26S ribosomal RNA genes and two or more copies of 5S ribosomal RNA genes with an interval of approximately 195 nucleotides were found in the TGS, strongly suggesting successful enrichment of non-repetitive regions of the genome. As to other structural RNA genes, 207 genes for snoRNAs, seven high-confidence predictions for 7S LRNAs, and 93 genes for small nuclear RNAs were deduced.Genome-wide transcriptome analyses have identified a large number of non-coding RNA species being transcribed in the genome.47,48 Using the previously accumulated information from L. japoncius transcripts by EST1 and SAGE49 analyses, we searched for transcripts derived from non-coding (intergenic) genomic regions. As a result, 1300 ESTs without similarity to known and predicted protein sequences were obtained, and 460 SAGE tag species solely identified in the SAGE analysis were identified as possible transcripts from intergenic regions in the genome. Since ESTs are partial sequences and SAGE tags originate from the 3′-most anchoring enzyme site of the transcripts, these ‘intergenic’ candidates may include those from UTRs of genes. Gene prediction of the genome sequence is done based on the presence of coding sequences of appropriate length. It is, therefore, possible that transcripts derived from unpredicted regions on the genome may encode a protein with a short open reading frame or that functions at the RNA level.In order to identify the miRNA precursor candidate in the L. japoncius genome, we performed a search using the A. thaliana mature miRNA sequences deposited in the miRNA registry database in the Sanger Institute (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/). As a result, we found 53 precursor sequence candidates encoding 26 miRNA species (Supplementary Table S6). Among the miRNAs detected only in A. thaliana (eudicots), but not in other species like mosses, ferns, gymnosperms and monocots,50 miRNAs 393, 395, 398, and 399 were found in the L. japonicus genome. In order to examine whether other leguminous plants possess these miRNAs, the TC sequences of G. max and Medicago truncatula were subjected to a search. As a result, miRNAs 395, 398, and 399 were found in the TC of at least one of the two legumes whereas miRNA 393 was detected in the M. truncatula BAC sequence (AC147434). We therefore speculate that these four miRNAs developed concurrently with the appearance of eudicots. We also focused on the copy number of miRNA genes (precursors). There are six genes encoding miR156 in A. thaliana, whereas only one was found in the L. japonicus genome. On the contrary, multiple genes in L. japonicus such as those encoding miRNAs 171, 399, 164, 166, 169, 172, and 319 were also found in multiple in A. thaliana (data not shown). An increase in the copy number of conserved miRNA species was not observed, indicating the possibility that conserved types of miRNAs had not been recruited in legume-specific gene regulatory mechanisms. We suppose that a significant part of gene regulation by miRNA in leguminous species is done by those that evolved specifically in the legume lineage. To identify species-specific miRNAs, a computational prediction was performed and 1312 miRNA candidates were found in the L. japonicus genome sequence, which can be grouped into 605 families (L. Schauser, personal communication).We attempted the identification of antisense transcription in the L. japonicus genome by comparing coding sequences with overlapping ESTs on both sense and antisense DNA strands. To discriminate between ESTs of antisense transcripts and wrongly oriented clones, only 3′ ESTs with a poly(T) signal and 5′ ESTs without a poly(T) signal were selected for this analysis. As a result, we found 322 such presumptive protein-coding genes. We suspect that some of them were derived from unselected antisense transcription; however, we obtained several pieces of evidence that indicate selective antisense transcription. We checked for the sequences of the exon–intron splice junctions and TATA box-like motif proximal to the antisense transcripts, and as a result, (an) intron(s) could be predicted in antisense transcripts of 41 genes, where the donor and acceptor sequence of the exon–intron splice junction was GT-AG in 49 cases and GC-AG in one case. We found TATA box-like motifs proximal to the antisense transcripts in ∼60% of the 322 protein-coding genes.3.5. Characteristic features of protein-encoding genesTentative genomic sequence was subjected to the automatic assignment of protein-encoding genes, and 10 951 complete and 19 848 partial gene structures, except those for transposons/retrotranspons, could be identified. Of the 30 799 presumptive protein-encoding genes, 16 096 (52%) carried ESTs with sequence identity of over 95% for a stretch 50 nucleotides long. Structural features of the protein-encoding genes in L. japonicus were investigated in detail using 5248 genes manually annotated in the 76.4 Mb from HGS. As shown in Supplementary Table S7, the basic structure of protein-encoding genes in L. japonicus is similar to that of A. thaliana35 except for the average lengths of genes and introns: 2917 versus 1918 bp and 395 versus 157 bp in L. japonicus and A. thaliana, respectively. The average gene density in L. japonicus was estimated to be one gene in every 10.2 kb (30 799 genes in 315 073 kb), which is longer than that in A. thaliana, one gene in every 4.5 kb. The total gene number in the L. japonicus genome could be deduced to be 34 245 by calculations based on the following assumptions: (i) the average density of the protein-encoding genes in the euchromatic regions is one gene in every 10.2 kb, (ii) the TGS is 315 073 kb long, and (iii) gene-space coverage of the TGS is estimated to be 90.2%.A similarity search of translated amino acid sequences of the presumptive 30 799 protein-encoding genes was performed against the UniProt knowledgebase as a protein sequence library.29 The result indicated that 19 405 (63%) genes had significant (<1e−20 cutoff of BLAST E-value) sequence similarity to genes of known function, 6790 (22%) were similar to hypothetical genes and the remaining 4604 (15%) did not show any similarity to the registered gene sequences. Eighty-five percent (24 212 genes out of 28 581), 51% (34 098 genes out of 66 710), 74% (31 456 genes out of 42 373), and 73% (22 328 genes out of 30 434) of the protein-encoding genes deduced from genomic sequences of A. thaliana,35 rice,36P. trichocarpa,37 and grapevine,38 respectively, showed significant sequence similarity (<1e−20) to those in L. japonicus. The presumptive protein-encoding genes were classified into functional categories according to GO,40 and the result was summarized in plant GOslim functional categories based on the InterPro domain, as shown in Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S8.Plant GOslim category classifications. The results of functional categorization are shown for 10 representative GOslim classes of ‘Molecular function’ (A) and ‘Biological process’ (B). GO was automatically annotated on the L. japonicus protein-encoding genes by searching InterPro domains.Plant GOslim category classifications. The results of functional categorization are shown for 10 representative GOslim classes of ‘Molecular function’ (A) and ‘Biological process’ (B). GO was automatically annotated on the L. japonicus protein-encoding genes by searching InterPro domains.Genes encoding transcription factors (TFs) were identified in the L. japonicus genome by assessing the TrEMBL and InterPro search results. The classification of TFs was performed according to the TF categories in the Arabidopsis Gene Regulatory Information Server at the Ohio State University (http://arabidopsis.med.ohio-state.edu/AtTFDB/). A total of 1481 genes were classified into 31 TF categories (Supplementary Table S9). EST matching provided evidence of transcription to 604 (41%) predicted TF genes (data not shown). TF genes classified into the C3H family were most frequently observed in the L. japonicus genome (183 genes), followed by 156 MYB and 142 AP2-EREBP family genes. While the distribution of TFs in L. japonicus and A. thaliana was generally similar (Supplementary Table S9), we found 75 ARF family genes in the L. japonicus genome, which is more than three times the number in A. thaliana (24 genes). ARF binds to auxin response elements in the promoter region of auxin-regulated genes.51 We found a relatively large number of unique sequences showing similarity to ARF genes in the Gene Index Project, 87 (31 singletons and 56 TCs) and 33 (13 singletons and 20 TCs), of G. Max and M. truncatula, respectively. An increased gene number (more than double) in the L. japonicus genome compared to A. thaliana was also observed for CAMTA and SBP family genes. CAMTA is a conserved TF among multicellular eukaryotes that is suggested to be involved in calcium signaling by direct binding of calmodulin.52 SBP is a plant specific TF that is characterized by a conserved 76 amino acid protein domain.53 The observed characteristics of the L. japonicus genome as well as those of G. max and M. truncatula suggest the possibility that some TF families have diverged to adapt to biological processes characteristic of leguminous plants such as nodulation and symbiotic nitrogen fixation with rhizobia.A two-component system is a mechanism that is conserved in a wide variety of intracellular signal transduction pathways in response to certain external or internal stimuli in prokaryotes; plants have come to adopt this system as one of their multiple signal transduction mechanisms. This system is typically composed of histidine kinases (HKs), response regulators (RRs), and less typically some intermediators, all of which participate in the phosphor-transfer reaction. It has been shown that the two-component elements are involved in signaling of the plant hormones, ethylene, and cytokinin in A. thaliana,54 and that these hormones play crucial roles in controlling nodule formation in legumes.55–57In the L. japoncius genome, 23 genes for HKs, including five and nine genes for ethylene and cytokinin receptors, respectively, were identified by similarity and domain searches. Lotus HK 1 (LHK1) is a member of the cytokinin receptor family and plays a crucial role in initiating cortical cell divisions in response to rhizobial signaling;55,56 this gene was located on chr 4 (chr4.CM0042.1660.nc), with a highly conserved paralog on chr 2 (chr2.LjB11M03.80.nc). A total of 20 genes for RRs, 11 of which have domains characteristic of DNA-binding transcriptional factors in their C-terminal portions, were identified in the L. japonicus genome. However, two of them (chr4.CM0042.1440.nc and chr4.CM0229.220.nc) had a replacement of the phospho-accepting Asp residue with Gly or Ala residues, suggesting that these genes might have lost the ability to participate in the His–Asp phosphor-relay pathway. It has been reported that a group of pseudo-response regulators (PRRs), in which the phospho-accepting Asp residue is replaced by Glu residue, are known to be distinct from the typical RR in that they are not involved in any phosphor-relay signaling. Five such genes including TOC1 in A. thaliana are known to be involved in the circadian rhythm.58 In L. japonicus, seven genes with a pseudo-receiver residue (Glu) were identified for PRR. One of these genes, chr4.CM0087.600.nc, was most similar to TOC1 (APRR1), while the other two genes, chr3.CM0208.230.nc and chr3.TM0616.60.nd, are likely to be candidates for clock components because they share a CCT motif in the C-terminal portion with the APRR components.Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) play important roles in sensing diverse signals in plant growth, development, and defense responses. A typical RLK consists of a signal sequence, diverse extracellular domains, a transmembrane region, and an intracellular eukaryotic protein kinase domain. RLKs in the A. thaliana genome form the largest class of transmembrane sensors and are encoded by more than 600 genes.59 The presumptive products of 1267 genes in the L. japonicus genome contained the protein kinase domain (InterProID, IPR000719), whereas those of 362 genes exhibited a domain composition that was similar to known RLKs. It has been reported that RLKs with leucine-rich repeats (LRRs: IPR001611) such as SYMRK (chr2.CM0177.340.nc)60 and HAR1 (chr3.CM0216.560.nc)61,62 were essential in the process of symbiotic nitrogen fixation in L. japonicus. The classification based on InterPro indicated that the presumptive products of 124 genes contained the LRR (IPR001611) in their extracellular region.The cascade of legume plant responses leading to nodule formation is triggered by recognition of lipo-chitooligosaccharide Nod factors that are produced by rhizobia by a family of receptor kinases containing the LysM domain (IPR002482) in their extracellular region.63 Presumptive products of 12 RLK genes in L. japonicus contained the exracellular LysM domain including Nfr1 (chr2.CM0545.460.nc) and Nfr5 (chr2.CM0323.400.nd), which have been proposed to be Nod-factor receptors, while only five such genes were found in A. thaliana. Therefore, it can be speculated that some of the remaining nine LysM–RLKs may participate in signal transduction during the process of nodule formation and pathogen recognition, as reported in A. thaliana and rice.64Transporters play indispensable roles in various cellular processes including the delivery of nutrients, elimination of waste products, and control of hormone efflux. As symbiotic nitrogen fixation requires the exchange of nutrients between host legume plant cells and intracellular rhizobia, a variety of transporters should be involved. A total of 1310 genes encoding possible transporters were deduced in the L. japonicus genome based on their sequence similarity to 995 A. thaliana genes registered in the TransportDB (http://www.membranetransport.org/). These genes were subsequently classified into 49 gene families. Some of these families were composed of a large number of paralogs (97–205 members), including the ATP-binding cassette (ABC) superfamily,65 the P-type ATPase (P-ATPase) superfamily, the drug/metabolite transporter superfamily, and the major facilitator superfamily. They account for a significant portion of the large number of transporter genes in L. japonicus, as is the case in A. thaliana.One of the transporter families that are characteristic to legumes encodes major intrinsic membrane proteins (MIPs), which are known to control water and solute homeostasis and constitute 10–15% of the total membrane proteins in the symbiosome. Eleven of the 37 genes for MIPs assigned in the L. japonicus genome were paralogous members of the LIMP2 gene (chr4.CM0046.520.nc), a multifunctional aquaglyceroporin, which exhibits specific expression in mature nitrogen fixing nodules.66 The LIMP2 gene and seven of the paralogs were clustered on chr 4 and chr 6 in tandem arrays. Proteome analysis in the nodule of L. japonicus has identified several types of peribacteroid membrane proteins. LIMP1 is one such protein known to encode a water-specific aquaporin.67 A gene for LIMP1 (chr1.CM0012.450.nc) as well as two paralogs (chr1.LjT36P09.70.nd and LjSGA_047026.1) were assigned in the L. japonicus genome.One of the characteristic features of legume plants is the production of a large variety of secondary metabolites including legume-specific 5-deoxyisoflavonoid. Among the genes encoding enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, those for Cytochrome P450 (Cyt P450) play crucial roles. The genes for Cyt P450 constitute a relatively large gene family, which are further classified into sub-families on the basis of nomenclature files on the Cyt P450 Homepage (http://drnelson.utmem.edu/cytochromeP450.html). A total of 313 putative genes for Cyt P450 were assigned to the L. japonicus genome (Supplementary Table S10), whereas 272 and 455 genes for Cyt P450 have been reported in A. thaliana and rice, respectively.68 Many of the Cyt P450 genes in L. japonicus formed tandem arrays, as in A. thaliana and rice, where those in a single array belong to the same gene family. The composition of some of the sub-families of Cyt P450 genes in L. japonicus was remarkably different from that of A. thaliana. Significant amplification of the members was observed in the sub-families CYP74A, CYP75B, CYC76C, CYP82C, CYP83B, CYP93C, and CYP716A, when compared with A. thaliana. Of these, the CYP75B and CYP93C sub-families have been reported to be involved in flavonoid synthesis;68,69 thus, expansion of these sub-families may be involved in the complexity of flavonoids in L. japonicus.Most of the disease resistance genes (R genes) encode intracellular proteins with a centrally located nucleotide binding site (NBS) and a C-terminal LRR region. This NBS–LRR family of R genes can be classified into two subgroups, toll and interleukin-1 receptor (TIR) and non-TIR, based on whether or not the putative gene product contains a region similar to the TIR domain at their amino termini. We identified 174 TIR NBS–LRR-type and 55 non-TIR NBS–LRR-type R genes and gene segments in the TGS of L. japonicus (Supplementary Table S11). The ratio of TIR versus non-TIR is similar to that found in A. thaliana (85 TIR NBS–LRR versus 36 non-TIR NBS–LRR), but differs from that in P. trichocarpa (64 TIR NBS–LRR versus 233 non-TIR NBS–LRR).37 Fifty-five of the 120 (83 TIR NBS–LRR and 37 non-TIR NBS–LRR) presumptive R genes assigned in the contiguous sequences of single or connected TAC/BAC clones were found as singletons, while the remaining 65 formed gene clusters, each consists of two to seven members of the same subfamily. Eighty-seven presumptive R genes genetically located on the linkage map were distributed unevenly among chromosomes: 17 (14 TIR NBS–LRR and 3 non-TIR NBS–LRR) on chr 1, 33 (18 and 15) on chr 2, 20 (15 and 5) on chr 3, 7 (5 and 2) on chr 4, 5 (0 and 5) on chr 5, and 5 (2 and 3) on chr 6 (Supplementary Table S11).In order to identify genes conserved in legumes but not in other plant species, predicted gene sequences of L. japonicus were subjected to comparison with predicted genes on the genomes of A. thaliana, rice, P. trichocarpa and grapevine as well as protein sequences in the TrEMBL protein database. Predicted gene sequences from the M. truncatula genome and G. max gene index were used as references for legume protein coding genes. Translated amino acid sequences of the predicted genes in L. japonicus were subjected to BLAST searches, and an E-value of <1e−20 was considered to be significant. As a result, we found 1190 genes (4%) that were conserved in leguminous species, but not in the currently available protein sequences of other plant species. InterPro annotations of these genes were surveyed to investigate the conserved motifs identified in these legume-specific genes, and 31 InterPro motifs were found to be conserved in five or more genes. Of these motifs, Cyclin-like F-box (IPR001810), LRR 2 (IPR013101), TIR (IPR000157) and trypsin-alpha amylase inhibitor (IPR003612) were found in 61, 26, 13 and 11 genes, respectively (Supplemental Table S12). Furthermore, a total of 2824 predicted genes in the L. japonicus genome were without a counterpart in the databases. Among them, complete gene structures were predicted for 599 genes; the most common InterPro motif was the RNA-binding region RNP-1 (IPR000504) (Supplementary Table S13). A similarity search against the L. japonicus ESTs indicated that at least 718 of these genes (25.4%) are transcribed. The entire lists of the legume- and L. japonicus-specific genes are provided in Supplementary Tables S14 and S15.3.6. Gene amplification and genome rearrangementIn order to detect gene amplification at the genome-wide level, reciprocal comparisons among the sequences of the presumptive protein-encoding genes in the L. japonicus genome were carried out using the BLASTP program. As a result, 56% of the genes (17 380 out of 30 799) matched one or more genes (with the cut-off <1e−20): 14% had one matched gene, 7% had two genes, and the remaining 35% had three or more matches. It should be noted that these results may be underestimated because genes that are truncated at the ends of a large number of contigs and those assigned to sequences of low accuracy in the TGS are likely to be overlooked under the above conditions. Indeed, when the genes assigned to the 1909 TAC/BAC clones whose sequences had a stretch of ∼100 kb of high accuracy were subjected to search, 65% of the genes (10 151 out of 15 512) occurred as multiple copies; this is the same rate as that observed in A. thaliana. Further searches using the 76.4 Mb HGS, where the relative positions of most of the genes was reliable, showed that 772 genes formed 310 groups of tandem arrays of two or more family genes (Supplementary Table S16). This corresponds to 7% of the genes assigned in the HGS (11 380), which is lower than those observed in A. thaliana (17%), rice (14%), and P. trichocarpa (11%). One possible explanation could be that frequent insertion of retroelements in the L. japonicus genome have disrupted tandem array structures, which is consistent with our observation that 9% of the genes assigned in HGS had family members in a range of 100 kb .During the course of the comparative analysis of the L. japonicus genome with those of other plants, we occasionally found that two distinct regions of the L. japonicus genome showed synteny with a single locus of other genomes. When these regions were plotted on the chromosomes, traces of large scale segmental duplications, possibly because of whole-genome duplication (WGD), became apparent (Fig. 3). These regions corresponded to 39% (231 out of 594) of the mapped TGS. Duplication of large blocks was found between chr 2/4, chr 4/6, chr 2/6, chr 1/3, chr 1/5, and chr 3/3. Only 13% (880 out of 6819) of the genes assigned in these regions were conserved in both of the duplicated regions, which is significantly lower than that between the syntenic regions of L. japonicus and M. truncatula where about 60% of the predicted genes were conserved. This observation supports the estimation that WGD occurred before the separation of L. japonicus and M. truncatula described in a previous report.70Segmentally duplicated regions in the L. japonicus genome. Individual chromosomes are depicted as horizontal bars. Colored boxes with the same color code connected by the blue line indicate each pair of duplicated segments.

Comparative analysis with genomes of model plants and crop legumeMicrosynteny against the M. truncatula genome was detected for 70% (418 out of 594) of the mapped TGS in L. japonicus, although traces of local duplications, inversions, deletions, and insertions were also observed. By combining the syntenic relations assigned at the clone and contig level in the TGS with their positional information on the genetic linkage map, the microsynteny could be expanded to macrosynteny at the level of whole chromosomes, which confirmed and strengthened previous observations.70 A syntenic relationship has also been detected between the genomes of L. japonicus and A. thaliana to a lesser degree. Conservation of relative positions of three or more genes has been observed in 69% (408 out of 594) of the mapped TGS of L. japonicus. This limited degree of syntenic relationship was proved to be useful for map-based cloning in L. japonicus.71 A similar level of synteny was detected against P. trichocarpa where 69% (409 out of 594) of the mapped TGS of L. japonicus exhibited syntenic relations. The microsyntenic relationships between the above plant species may provide useful information for predicting gene organization in the ancestral genome of dicot plants.3.8. ConclusionsTo date, two types of sequencing strategy have been adopted in order to fully sequence plant genomes: clone-by-clone sequencing based on physical maps and whole-genome shotgun sequencing. Both strategies have their advantages and disadvantages in terms of labor, cost, speed, and data accuracy. In this study, we modified the two strategies into seed-based clone-by-clone and selected genome shotgun sequencing, combined them, and anchored the obtained sequences onto maps by linkage analysis and FISH. This strategy takes advantage of the strengths of the conventional methods, and provides information that meets the majority of requirements for a wide variety of uses in fundamental and applied biology. It can therefore be applied with appropriate modifications to the genomes of diverse plants species, especially large crop genomes that will be interesting to sequence in the future.The nucleotide sequences and their positional information generated in this study revealed characteristic features of the legume genomes: the expansion of functional domains and gene families for TFs, elements of the two-component system, transporters, P450 proteins, proteins involved in disease resistance, and the presence of unique genes such as those for receptor kinases essential for symbiotic nitrogen fixation and those specific to legume plants. Synteny analysis among the sequenced plant genomes detected traces of WGD and subsequent genome evolution in L. japonicus, and also the presence of synteny blocks with genomes of model and crop plants to various degrees. Conservation of colinearity of the genes and synteny blocks on the chromosomes among plant species indicates that the genome information for L. japonicus could serve as a hub for transferring knowledge toward the improvement of crop legumes. The detailed and comprehensive analyses of the genome information reported in this study may lead to the identification of a variety of legume- and plant-specific genetic systems.The genome sequence information is available through the international databases (DDBJ/Genbank/EMBL) under accession numbers DF093176–DF093536 (for genome clone contigs), AP009625–AP010255 (for genome clone sequences) and BABK01000001–BABK01109986 (for SGA sequences).

IntroductionDNA microarray is an important tool for understanding regulatory networks. In fact, this technique was used to analyze changes in the amounts of mRNA in cellular phenomena such as cell differentiation, cellular senescence, and cell cycle progression in a comprehensive manner. Moreover, we have successfully improved the sensitivity and reproducibility of DNA microarray analysis.1 Although many of the expression profile data obtained through DNA microarray analysis are available at various websites, such data are based on steady-state mRNA levels. It is obvious that both mRNA synthesis and degradation influence steady-state mRNA levels, but usually only the total mRNA is quantified. If we can quantify nascent mRNA in a real-time manner, it will become possible to estimate mRNA synthesis and degradation rates by comparing the nascent amount with the total amount of RNA measured by an ordinary DNA microarray system. One method of detecting nascent mRNA is the nuclear run-on assay.2 Recently, the transcriptional profiling of radio-labeled RNAs using the nylon-membrane DNA microarray was reported.3–5 The current standard platforms are GeneChip by Affymetrix, the Stanford-type DNA microarray, and the oligo-DNA microarray. In general, it is very difficult to compare data from such standard DNA microarray systems with data obtained by the nylon membrane DNA microarray. To comprehensively analyze nascent RNAs using these current standard platforms, improved methods for the isolation and labeling of nascent mRNAs were reported. Cleary et al. used uracil phosphoribosyltransferase gene-transformed human cells in Toxoplasma gondii. Nascent RNAs from these cells grown in 2,4-dithiouracil were labeled with thio-substrated UTP, purified, and analyzed by DNA microarray.6 However, it is necessary to introduce this gene to the cell to be analyzed prior to DNA microarray analysis.Bromouridine, which substitutes 5′ of uridine to bromine, is inexpensive and becomes incorporated into cells with very high efficiency. Additional steps, such as electroporation or lipofection, are not necessary for labeling mRNA with this compound. After its incorporation into cells, bromouridine is converted to Br-UTP. During transcription, converted Br-UTP is recognized as the same substrate as UTP and is incorporated into nascent RNAs.7 This labeling method was applied in the immunocytochemical analysis by using anti-bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) antibody in several studies.8–11 That antibody was used also to immunoprecipitate this BrU-labeled nascent RNA.12,13 The same reports analyzed transcriptional changes of some genes in small amounts (on the order of the picogram) of nascent RNAs.12,13For a comprehensive analysis using DNA microarray, we have optimized the conditions for immunoprecipitation using BrdU antibody. We have improved the specificity of nascent mRNA isolation by orders of magnitude using adequate blocking agents in immunoprecipitation. As the amount of nascent RNA obtained was very small even under the optimized purification conditions, we sought to develop a method for amplifying small amounts of mRNA with little bias and have succeeded in this goal. Finally, we have performed transcriptional analysis of nascent RNAs using G2 phase-synchronized mouse mammary carcinoma FM3A cells, and we have obtained several interesting insights into cell cycle regulation of the G2 phase.These results demonstrate that DNA microarray analysis with nascent RNAs obtained by our new method will provide valuable insights into the functions of genes in various types of cells.2. Materials and Methods2.1. Preparation of BrU-labeled eGFP cRNA and non-labeled luciferase cRNAeGFP cRNA and luciferase cRNA were prepared by T7 in vitro transcription. DNA templates for each cRNA synthesis were constructed by PCR amplification from plasmid DNA containing eGFP or luciferase genes. These templates contain both T7 promoter sequence and polyA sequence. The DNA template of eGFP was amplified from pEGFP-c1 by PCR. The DNA template of luciferase was amplified from pTRE (Clontech, Mountain View, CA, USA) by PCR. Sequences of primers were described in ‘Supplementary data’. The PCR products were purified from agarose gel by using Wizard SV gel and PCR purification kit (Promega, Madison, WI, USA).cRNAs were transcribed with Br-UTPs (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and NTPs using the MAXIscript® T7 kit. cRNAs were purified according to the RNA-cleanup protocol of the RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany).2.2. Preparation of Mouse anti-BrdU IgG binding dynabeadsTwo micrograms of mouse anti-bromodeoxyuridine antibody (Roche Diagnostics, Indianapolis, IN, USA) were incubated with 25 μl Dynabeads® Goat anti-mouse IgG (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) in 2.0 ml collection tubes containing 100 μl DEPC-treated phosphate-buffered saline (PBS)/0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA) solution. The tubes were rotated at room temperature for an hour. After the dynabeads were collected by a magnet rack, the dynabeads were washed three times with 1 ml DEPC-treated PBS/0.1% BSA, and 100 μl DEPC-treated PBS /0.1% BSA was added.2.3. Immunoprecipitation of BrU-labeled RNA by antibody beadsFollowing steps were conducted in the dark. Two hundred nanograms of BrU-labeled eGFP cRNA and 200 ng of non-labeled luciferase cRNA were denatured at 80°C for 10 min. As the blocking agent, 20 μg FM3A total RNA or 200 μg Escherichia coli 16S and 23S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) or uridine (final concentration of 0.3 M) was added. The denatured RNAs were added to the beads containing 225 U/ml RNasin® Plus RNase inhibitor (Promega). PBS(-)/0.1% BSA was added to this solution to a volume of 250 μl. The beads were rotated for 1 h at room temperature. After the beads were washed with 0.8 ml DEPC-treated PBS/0.1% BSA containing 45 U/ml RNasin® Plus RNase inhibitor (Promega), they were also washed with 0.8 ml DEPC-treated PBS three times. After the addition of 10 μl of RNase-free water, RNAs which bound to beads were eluted by denaturation at 80°C for 10 min, and then were kept cold on ice for 2 min.2.4. Reverse transcription of cRNA and Real-time RT–PCRFive microliters of the isolated RNAs were mixed with 1 μl of 50 μM oligo(dT)20 primer and denatured at 65°C for 5 min. First-strand cDNAs were synthesized from the isolated RNAs using the SuperScript® III First-Strand Synthesis System for RT–PCR (Invitrogen). After reverse transcription, 1 U of RNase H was reacted for 20 min at 37°C.Real-time quantitative PCR was performed in an ABI prism 7900HT Sequence Detection System (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA) using SYBR® Premix Ex Taq™ (Perfect Real Time) (Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan). Sequences of each primer were described in ‘Supplementary data’. The PCR cycling program was set as follows: 95°C for 15 s followed by 40 cycles of 95°C for 5 s and 60°C for 34 s. One of cDNAs diluted 100 times was used in a 50 μl reaction. A standard graph for eGFP cDNA and luciferase cDNA was simultaneously generated using 104, 105, 106, 107, and 108 copies of the pEGFP plasmid and the pTRE plasmid. Each cDNA was analyzed in triplicate. Three experiments were conducted, and the averages of the cDNA copy numbers as well as standard deviation were calculated.2.5. Cell culture of FM3A cells and labeling nascent RNA with BrUMouse FM3A cells and tsFT210 cells, Cdc2 temperature-sensitive mutant strain of FM3A cells,14,15 were cultured in RPMI 1640 medium (Invitrogen) with 10% dialyzed bovine serum, 2 mM l-glutamine, 0.1 mM MEM non-essential amino acid (Invitrogen), and 50 U/ml penicillin–50 mg/ml streptomycin (Invitrogen) at 32°C in 5% CO2.After bromouridine was added to the medium to a final concentration of 100 μM, FM3A cells were cultured for an hour in the dark. FM3A cells were collected in 50 ml centrifuge tubes and washed twice with cold PBS, and total RNA was isolated by using an RNeasy midi kit (Qiagen). DNase I digestion was conducted during isolation of RNA.2.6. Immunoprecipitation of nascent RNA from mouse FM3A cellsTwenty micrograms of total RNA from bromouridine-treated FM3A were immunoprecipitated with 200 μg of E. coli 16S and 23S rRNAs. The method of immunoprecipitation was described above. The amount of the eluted RNA was measured using the Quant-iTTM RiboGreen® RNA quantitation kit (Invitrogen). Five hundred nanometers of fluorescence of the RiboGreen reagent bound to RNA were measured using the fluorescence microplate reader ARVO (Perkin Elmer, Boston, MA, USA).2.7. Spike-in experimentBoth BrU-labeled eGFP cRNA and non-labeled luciferase cRNA were added to 20 μg of total RNA from bromouridine-treated FM3A cells. We conducted three different kinds of experiments. Each experiment was performed with a different amount of cRNAs (2 ng, 200 pg, or 20 pg). These RNAs were immunoprecipitated with 200 μg E. coli 16S and 23S rRNAs as blocking agents.2.8. Validation with RT–PCR of the DNA microarray data using each amplification methodMethods of experiences were described in ‘Supplementary data’.2.9. Preparation of DNA MicroarrayOligonucleotide probe sets of Mus musculus AROS Version 3.0 (Operon Biotechnologies, Huntsville, AL, USA) were dissolved at 10 μM in 3× SSPE solution (Invitrogen), and spotted on γ-amino propyl silane-coated UltraGAPS Coated Slides (Corning, New York, NY, USA) and UV cross-linked as described previously.12.10. cDNA synthesis and amplificationThe amplification of RNA was performed using the Super SMART™ PCR cDNA Synthesis Kit (Clontech) as follows. We have modified the manufacture's protocol and optimized it for our DNA microarray system. Total RNA (20 ng) was mixed with 7 µl of 12 µM 3′ SMART CDS Primer II A and 7 µl of 12 µM SMART II A Oligonucleotide, incubated at 65°C for 2 min, and cooled to room temperature. To this mixture was added 20 µl of 5× First-Strand Buffer, 2 µl of 100 mM DTT, 10 µl of 10 mM of 50× dNTP, and 5 µl of PowerScript™ Reverse Transcriptase, and the reaction was incubated at 42°C for 90 min. After the reaction, 1 µl of 0.5 M EDTA was added. First-strand cDNA was purified with the NucleoSpin Extraction Kit (Clontech). For the amplification by long-distance PCR using the Advantage® 2 PCR Kit (Clontech), first-strand cDNA was mixed with 10 µl of 10× Advantage® 2 PCR Buffer, 2 µl of 10 mM 50× dNTP, 2 µl of 12 µM of 5′PCR Primer II A, and 2 µl of 50× Advantage® 2 Polymerase Mix. The PCR conditions consisted of a 95°C for 1 min, followed by appropriate number of cycles of amplification at 95°C for 15 s, 65°C for 30 s, and 68°C for 6 min. The appropriate number of cycling on which the PCR product will remain in the exponential phase of amplification was determined by the cDNA amplification results of the range of PCR cycles obtained in pre-experiments. The PCR product was purified with Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System (Promega). For aminoallyl labeling, 1 µg cDNA was mixed with 15 µl of Random Primers Buffer Mixture (Invitrogen), incubated at 95°C for 5 min, and cooled on ice. Then, 5 μl of an aminoallyl–dNTP mixture which contained 5 mM aminoallyl–dUTP (Sigma), 5 mM dATP (GE healthcare, Uppsala, Sweden), 5 mM dGTP (GE healthcare), and 5 mM dCTP (GE healthcare) was added. Next 9 U of Klenow Fragment (Invitrogen) was added and incubated at 37°C for 120 min. After the reaction, 5 µl of Stop Buffer (Invitrogen) was added. Aminoallyl-labeled cDNA was purified with ethanol precipitation following the first purification with Wizard SV Gel and PCR Clean-Up System. For the coupling reaction, aminoallyl-labeled cDNA was dissolved with 5 µl of 0.1 M NaHCO3 and mixed with 5 µl of Cy3 Mono-reactive Dye (GE healthcare) or Cy5 Mono-reactive Dye (GE healthcare) in 50 µl Atlas Glass Approved DMSO (BD Bioscience), and incubated for 60 min at room temperature. After coupling, 15 µl of 4 M hydroxylamine–HCl (Sigma-Aldrich) was added and incubated at room temperature for 15 min. Cy-Dye labeled cDNA was purified with the MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit (Qiagen).2.11. HybridizationThese procedures were based on TF oligo microarray hybridization as described previously.1 Some of the conditions and compositions of solutions were changed: the hybridization solution consisted of a mixture of Cy3- and Cy5-labeled cDNAs, 40% formamide, 5× SSC, 0.4% SDS, and 1.9 μg/μl acetylated BSA (Invitrogen). Hybridization was performed with a hybridization chamber (Agilent Technologies, Palo Alto, CA, USA) and a hybridization gasket slide (Agilent Technologies). The temperature in both the pre-hybridization and hybridization steps was 45°C. Hybridization images were scanned using an Agilent DNA microarray scanner (Agilent Technologies).We hybridized four slides as self–self hybridization: Cy3-labeled cDNAs of nascent RNA from FM3A cells and Cy5-labeled cDNA of nascent RNA from FM3A cells.In experiments using G2 phase-arrested cells, we hybridized four slides: Cy3-labeled cDNAs of asynchronous cells and Cy5-labeled cDNAs of G2 phase-arrested cells were hybridized in two slides, and dye-swapped cDNAs were hybridized in the other two.2.12. DNA microarray analysesFluorescence intensities in spots were quantified using Feature Extraction software version GX (Agilent Technologies). Spots flagged as non-uniform outliners of either a feature (spot) or background were removed. In each array, genes whose expression levels were lower than those of the negative control spots under both conditions were removed. The ratios of signal intensities between the two cell types were calculated through Lowess normalization using GeneSpring GX (Agilent Technologies). We calculated the average and the standard deviation of the base 2 logarithm of the expression ratios of four spots and removed the expression ratios of genes whose standard deviation was >1. The expression ratios of genes whose average signal intensity was <50 were also removed.2.13. Analyses of nascent RNA profiles in G2-arrested cells and asynchronous cellstsFT210 cells were arrested in the G2 phase by incubation for 17 h at a non-permissive temperature (39°C). Bromouridine was added to the medium to a concentration of 100 μM at 16 h after the shift at 39°C. RNA was isolated using the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen). DNase I digestion was conducted during isolation of RNA. The DNA microarray analyses are described above.2.14. Cell cycle analysisCells were harvested, washed with PBS, and fixed in 70% ethanol at −20°C for at least 4 h. Fixed cells were washed twice with PBS and mixed with PBS containing 0.3% Triton X-100 (w/v) (Sigma-Aldrich). Cells were added with PBS (−) containing 50 μg/ml propidium iodide (Sigma-Aldrich) and 0.1 mg/ml RNase A (Sigma-Aldrich), and incubated for 20 min at 37°C in the dark before being filtered through a 41 μm nylon mesh. We analyzed the DNA contents by measuring the intensity of the fluorescence produced by propidium iodide using the FACSCalibur instrument (Beckon Dickinson, Mountain View, CA, USA) using instructions supplied by the manufacturer.3. Results and Discussion3.1. Experimental scheme of DNA microarray analysis for the nascent RNAThe new method for performing comprehensive analyses of nascent RNA is illustrated in Fig. 1. In the first step, bromouridine was added to the culture medium. This compound was incorporated into cells, which converted it to Br-UTP. As BrUTP is recognized as the same substrate as UTP, nascent mRNA is labeled by BrU7 (Fig. 1). Total RNAs isolated from the BrU-treated cells were immunoprecipitated with anti-BrdU antibody beads.12,13 The RNAs bound to the beads were eluted by heat denaturation after washing, and the eluted mRNAs were reverse-transcribed using oligo-dT primer. The cDNAs were linearly amplified using the template-switching (TS) PCR method. The amplified cDNAs labeled with Cy3/Cy5 were used for DNA microarray analysis (Fig. 1). Among these steps, the method for immunoprecipitating the BrU-labeled nascent RNAs was based on a method described previously12,13 and optimized for DNA microarray analysis in the following manner. Approximately 50 pg of the BrU-labeled RNA from mouse pre-implantation embryos was obtained and subjected to the same analysis as used in a previous study.13 The RNA amount should be >20 ng in total RNA. This is ∼1000 times more than that in the previous study.Overview of the isolation of nascent RNAs for microarray analysis.Overview of the isolation of nascent RNAs for microarray analysis.Therefore, it was necessary to develop a method for immunoprecipitating a large amount of BrU-labeled RNA with high specificity.3.2. Determination of optimum conditions for enriching nascent RNAs using cRNAs synthesized in vitroAs the amount of BrU-labeled nascent RNAs is much smaller than that of non-labeled RNAs in the RNA fractions extracted from living cells, it was necessary to develop a method for obtaining BrU-labeled RNAs with high recovery as well as on a certain scale. In the first trial, a mixture of BrU-labeled eGFP cRNAs and non-labeled luciferase cRNAs prepared by T7 in vitro transcription was immunoprecipitated in the same tube. cRNAs eluted from the affinity beads were reverse-transcribed with oligo-dT primer, and the copy number of each cDNA was quantified by real-time quantitative PCR (Fig. 2A). We defined the ratio of the eGFP cDNA copy number to the luciferase cDNA copy number as the index of immunoprecipitation specificity. This index well reflects the enrichment efficiency of nascent mRNAs. We also examined the effects of adding blocking agents such as uridine, total RNA from FM3A cells, and E. coli 16S and 23S rRNAs. Although interferon-τ RNA was shown to work well as a blocker in a previous report,13 we chose uridine, E. coli rRNA, and mouse total RNA as candidates for a blocking agent because we thought they would be more suitable for large-scale isolation of nascent RNAs. We evaluated the effects of these blocking agents with increasing amounts of cRNA. Under our conditions, the addition of uridine did not change the ratio. In contrast, the ratios observed in the experiments with E. coli rRNA or FM3A total RNA were approximately double those obtained in an experiment carried out without RNAs as the blocking agent (Fig. 2B). These data suggest that any kind of RNA can increase the specificity of the immunoaffinity purification of nascent RNAs. We thus chose E. coli 16S and 23S rRNAs as suitable blocking agents. These bacterial rRNAs are inexpensive and do not exist in mammalian cells. In addition, E. coli 16S and 23S rRNAs should not be reverse-transcribed when mRNA is reverse-transcribed by using oligo-dT primer.Binding specificity of BrU-labeled cRNA by in vitro transcription. (A) eGFP and luciferase gene were transcribed in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase. Br-UTP was used as the substrate instead of UTP during the transcription of eGFP. (B) Mixture of 200 ng of BrU-labeled eGFP and non-labeled luciferase cRNA was immunoprecipitated with addition to blocking agents. The eluted cRNAs were converted into cDNA, and then the cDNA copy number was measured using real-time quantitative PCR.

Error bars represent standard errors of the means (n = 3).Binding specificity of BrU-labeled cRNA by in vitro transcription.

Error bars represent standard errors of the means (n = 3).3.3. Conditions for labeling nascent RNAs with BrUNext, we treated living cells with bromouridine and immunoprecipitated BrU-labeled nascent RNAs from BrU-treated cells. We first tested and determined the appropriate concentration (100 μM) of bromouridine, i.e. that which did not affect proliferation and cell cycle progression in mouse FM3A cells (data not shown). Using DNA microarray analysis, we also confirmed that the gene expression profile of FM3A cells after treatment with 100 μM bromouridine for 4 h was extensively the same as that of untreated cells (data not shown). Approximately 20 μg total RNA was isolated from 2 × 106 FM3A cells that had been treated with 100 μM bromouridine for 1 h; this total RNA was then subjected to immunoaffinity purification. We used E. coli 16S and 23S rRNAs as blocking agents. The amount of eluted RNAs in the sample of BrU-treated cells was ∼30 ng, so we had successfully obtained a sufficient amount of BrU-labeled RNA for DNA microarray analyses. We then evaluated the specificity of immunoaffinity purification.3.4. Evaluation of purification efficiency with spike-in controlTo more precisely estimate the efficiency with which nascent RNAs were purified, small amounts of T7 in vitro transcribed BrU-labeled eGFP cRNA and non-labeled luciferase cRNA were added to the RNAs obtained from BrU-treated FM3A cell samples as the ‘spike-in’ control. We immunoprecipitated these RNA mixtures and compared the cDNA copy numbers of eluted eGFP cDNA and luciferase cDNA. To determine whether or not the amount of the eluted BrU-labeled eGFP cRNA was proportional to that of the input eGFP cRNA, increasing amounts (20 pg, 200 pg, and 2 ng) of eGFP cRNA and luciferase cRNA were added to 20 μg of BrU-labeled total RNA obtained from FM3A cells (Fig. 3A). The ratio of eluted eGFP cDNA to eluted luciferase cDNA exceeded 83 under the conditions shown in Fig. 3B. In addition, the copy number of eluted BrU-labeled eGFP cRNA was proportional to that of the input eGFP cRNA. These results indicated that we were able to immunoaffinity-purify BrU-labeled RNA with high specificity and that the eluted RNA reflects the nascent RNA before immunoprecipitation. Taken together, these findings indicate that we have successfully optimized the conditions for immunoaffinity-purification with high specificity. It was already demonstrated that the enrichment process using anti-BrdU immunoaffinity beads does not have any bias.13 As it is important to confirm that the cDNA amplification process does not have any significant bias, we performed the following experiments.Binding specificity in immunoprecipitation with spike-in controls. (A) Overview of the experiment.

Error bars represent standard errors of the means (n = 3).3.5. DNA microarray analyses of nascent RNAsTo carry out DNA microarray analysis, nascent RNAs of BrU-treated cells have to be amplified without bias. We previously developed a method for effectively amplifying small amounts of RNA using the TS-PCR reaction16 (Fig. 4A). To examine whether or not this amplification method has any amplification bias, we compared the data obtained by DNA microarray analysis with those obtained by quantitative real-time PCR using RNA samples prepared from ES cells.1 We considered that the efficiency of amplification would vary according to the differences in cellular RNA abundance. Genes with abundant RNA would be amplified without bias, but genes with low amounts of RNA might fail to be amplified accurately. As the expression levels of transcription-factor genes are generally much lower than those of genes in other categories, we focused on expression changes of the transcription factor genes. We used the TF oligo microarray, which can accurately determine expression changes of transcription factor genes.1 As shown in Fig. 4B, the expression changes in TS-PCR amplification were detected accurately, without amplification bias, except for Prdx1, Rara. Especially, the fold changes of Dcx, Meis1, and Ttyh1 obtained by TS PCR were not only quite similar to the data obtained without amplification, but were also similar to the data from quantitative real-time PCR, whereas amplification by in vitro transcription with T7 promoter exhibited some discrepancies. Thus, amplification by TS PCR has very little bias (Fig. 4B).However, there was a possibility that amplification efficiency and the reverse-transcription efficiency of BrU-labeled mRNA were different from that of non-labeled mRNA, so we compared the agarose-gel electrophoresis pattern of amplified cDNA from BrU-labeled mRNA (nascent mRNA) with that from non-labeled mRNA (steady-state mRNA). The result obtained by agarose-gel electrophoresis experiment of amplified cDNA from BrU-labeled mRNA shows a smear pattern identical to or very similar to that of amplified cDNA from non-labeled mRNA (data not shown). This result suggests that both the reverse-transcription efficiency and the amplification efficiency were almost identical between BrU-labeled RNA and non-labeled RNA. A self–self hybridization experiment was conducted with amplified cDNA labeled with Cy3/Cy5, and we detected gene expression levels with broad signal ranges. The ratios of Cy5 to Cy3 in all genes were in the range of 0.5–2.0 (Fig. 4C), indicating that our DNA microarray analysis is highly reproducible.(A) Eluted RNAs were converted to cDNA, and cDNA was amplified by TS-PCR. (B) Validation with quantitative RT–PCR of the DNA microarray data using each amplification method. Genes expressed at various levels in the non-amplification method, TS-PCR amplification method, and T7 in vitro transcription (IVT) amplification method were confirmed using quantitative RT–PCR. Quantitative RT–PCR was performed using the total RNA of these transcription factors. Gapd was used as the control. The same total RNA was used for quantitative RT–PCR and DNA microarray experiments. The ratio of the total target RNA levels was normalized by using those of the Tbp (Mus musculus TATA box binding protein) gene, and the fold change for each gene in the differentiated ES cells compared to the control ES cells was calculated. Error bars represent standard deviations of log (base 2) of ratio.

DNA microarray analysis of nascent RNA in mouse G2 phase-arrested FT210 cellsWe then compared the expression profiles of nascent RNAs of 32 000 transcript products between asynchronous mouse FM3A cells and G2 phase-synchronized FM3A cells. To obtain a highly synchronized population of G2 phase cells, we chose tsFT210 cells, which are temperature-sensitive Cdc2 mutant cells of mouse mammary carcinoma FM3A cells.14,15 tsFT210 cells are grown at 32°C (the permissive temperature), but in the G2 phase, they are arrested at 39°C (Fig. 5A). With this cell line, a highly synchronized population of cells is easily available by just shifting the culture temperature. It has already been shown that such synchronization is merely a result of the inactivation of just one protein (CDC2 protein).15 We also analyzed steady-state RNA expression profiles of asynchronous cells and G2-synchronized cells. Scatter plots of the expression level are shown in Fig. 5B. Considering the variation of DNA microarray data, we regarded the genes that showed changes exceeding twofold as either up- or down-regulated genes. Figure 5C shows Venn diagram analyses of genes whose expression was up- or down-regulated more than twofold in nascent RNA and steady-state RNA. There was no gene whose nascent RNA was up-regulated, whereas its steady-state RNA was down-regulated, and vice versa.DNA microarray analyses of nascent RNAs.

(C) The Venn diagrams show the overlap of genes whose expression levels changed more than twofold in the nascent RNA profile and the steady-state RNA profile.Among the genes whose nascent RNA levels changed more than twofold, cell cycle progression-related genes are listed in Table 1. Of the 18 genes listed, 14 genes exhibited fold changes in the analysis of nascent RNA but not in that of steady-state RNA.The partial lists of cell cycle related genes whose level of nascent RNAs changed more than twofold in G2 arrested cellsThe partial lists of cell cycle related genes whose level of nascent RNAs changed more than twofold in G2 arrested cellsWe found interesting expression profiles in Cdkn1a. Cdkn1a (p21) was up-regulated in both analyses (Table 1). Although this gene was previously reported to function as a signal transducer involved in the transition from the G1 phase to the S phase or from the G2 phase to the M phase,17 the changes in the expression profiles of the gene at the G2 phase were not analyzed. As up-regulation of the steady-state RNA and nascent RNA of this gene is clearly observed, it follows that this gene may have an important function in the transition from the G2 phase to the M phase.In addition to Cdkn1a, we have found that Pak1 and Pak2 also exhibited interesting expression profiles. The changes in expression levels of these genes were detected in the analysis of only the nascent RNAs. The PAK family is involved in microtubule and actin cytoskeleton reorganization.18 PAK1 and PAK2 interact with centrosomal kinase Aurora-A, and activated PAK1 phosphorylates Aurora-A in mitosis.19 On the other hand, the injection of 58 kDa active Pak1 into Xenopus oocytes inhibits cell cleavage by arresting G2/M progression,20 suggesting that these products have different role at these phases. These results of DNA microarray analysis indicate that mRNAs of these genes were not only synthesized but also degraded between the G2 phase and the M phase. As it is likely that synthesis and degradation occur in the same period, it seems difficult to identify the changes in expression levels of these gene mRNAs just by analyzing the steady-state levels.We also found that Rplp2, Rpl27, Rps25, Rpl9, and Rps29, which are categorized as ribosomal proteins, were down-regulated at the G2 phase (Table 2). Interestingly, the changes in the expression of these genes were not detected in steady-state RNA, although they were detected in the nascent RNA analysis (Table 2). Changes in gene expression were not detected in other ribosomal proteins in both analyses. Therefore, it is possible that these five ribosomal proteins have distinct features in their gene expression regulatory mechanisms. A previous study predicted binding sites in transcriptional regulatory regions or promoters of mammalian ribosomal protein genes for transcriptional factors.21 Those authors observed that genes for these five ribosomal proteins lack TATA-box and A/T-rich sequences similar to the TATA box, whereas two-thirds of the genes for ribosomal proteins have the TATA box or its homolog in their promoter regions. Another study found that a unique sequence (a tandem repeat of the TCTCGCGAGA motif) does exist among many human genes that lack the TATA box.22 This sequence motif was found at especially high frequencies in the genes for cell cycle regulators as well as in human ribosomal proteins. This sequence motif was also found in the upstream regions of three genes (Rpl9, Rps29, and Rps25) out of the five genes that exhibit changes in gene expression in only the nascent RNA analysis. As translational control is also regarded as an important mechanism for cell cycle regulation, it is possible to obtain new insight into cell cycle regulation in the G2 phase by performing functional analyses of these ribosomal proteins.The lists of ribosomal proteins whose level of nascent RNAs changed more than twofold in G2 arrested cellsPresence or absence of TATA box and A/T rich similar sequence was based on the Perry et al.21*Ribosomal protein genes which have TATA box or A/T rich tract in those upstream region.The lists of ribosomal proteins whose level of nascent RNAs changed more than twofold in G2 arrested cellsPresence or absence of TATA box and A/T rich similar sequence was based on the Perry et al.21*Ribosomal protein genes which have TATA box or A/T rich tract in those upstream region.3.7. Applications of comprehensive nascent RNA expression analysesThese examples indicate that our DNA microarray analysis of nascent RNAs has advantages over DNA microarray analysis of steady-state mRNAs. One advantage is that it can provide numerous insights into the regulatory mechanism underlying gene expression. For example, as the changes in expression levels of many transcription factors are relatively small in the process of cellular differentiation, our new method will give us novel insights into the structure of the gene expression regulatory network, since this method can detect slight expression changes. Collecting time-course data on nascent RNAs will also provide important information.Recently, Kenzelmann et al.23 reported that nascent RNAs could be analyzed by DNA microarray. In their report, the nascent RNAs were mRNAs labeled using 4-thiol uridine and then purified using affinity beads whose surfaces were coated with a toxic organomercury compound.23 In our method, precipitation was performed using Dynabeads, which are commonly used in classical immunoprecipitation and do not contain a heavy metal. This is another advantage of our method. Although the DNA microarray used in this study is an oligo-DNA microarray, this method is applicable to other platforms such as cDNA microarray or Affymetrix's GeneChip.In summary, our study provides very useful techniques for isolating nascent RNAs with high specificity. By comparing the data between steady-state RNAs and nascent RNAs, we can analyze changes in gene expression with much higher sensitivity. We can also determine the kinetics of transcription by combining the DNA microarray study of nascent mRNAs with that of existing mRNAs. The application of such an analysis will provide important information in the field of transcriptome analysis.

Thus, our large-scale gene profiling study may help finding sensitive and specific DNA markers for diagnosing autoimmune diseases including vasculitis and SLE.1. IntroductionThere are ∼10 different disorders that are classified as vasculitis (also known as angiitis). Vasculitis is a systemic autoimmune disease characterized by the chronic inflammation of systemic blood vessels, veins, and arteries of all types and sizes. This often causes symptoms that can rapidly induce death, such as the formation of blood clots (thrombosis), restriction of oxygenated blood supply (ischemia), and irreversible injury to affected organs.1 Although immune system disturbances appear to be the main cause of the disease, the pathogenesis of vasculitis is not fully understood. The diagnosis and treatment of vasculitis was recently greatly aided by the observation that three vasculitis disorders, namely Wegener's granulomatosis (WG), microscopic polyangiitis (MPA), and Churg–Strauss syndrome (CSS), are characterized by the presence of circulating antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibodies (ANCAs).2,3 Two different types of ANCA have been identified. C-ANCA targets proteinase-3 and is most frequently found in WG, whereas P-ANCA, which targets myeloperoxidase, is most frequently detected in MPA and CSS. Consequently, enzyme immunosorbent assays (EIA) that examine the ability of patient serum to bind to these enzymes can be used to diagnose WG, MPA, and CSS. However, diagnoses made on the basis of positive EIAs will still need to be confirmed by biopsies. Moreover, many other vasculitis disorders are not characterized by the presence of ANCAs. Thus, the diagnosis of vasculitis disorders requires the identification of more convenient and generally applicable diagnostic markers. The identification of these markers may also provide insights into the pathogenesis behind this disorder and improve the therapy of vasculitis.We have isolated putative gene markers that are characteristic to the autoimmune diseases, such as systemic lupus erythematodes (SLE)4 and rheumatoid arthritis (RA)5, using peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Here, we sought to identify new gene markers that can distinguish the autoimmune disease, in particular vasculitis, from other diseases with high specificity when PBMCs serve as the sample. For this purpose, we used the stepwise subtraction technique6 and high-density oligonucleotide microarrays to isolate those genes that show dramatically upregulated expression commonly in the pooled PBMC mRNAs of varieties of vasculitis patients regardless of the patient's symptom, active, or inactive phase when compared with normal volunteer PBMC mRNAs. To identify the genes that are upregulated in many vasculitis patients, we selected and mixed the PBMC mRNAs from patients with one of the following seven vasculitis disorders: WG, MPA, Takayasu's arteritis (TA), allergic granulomatous angiitis (AGA), malignant RA (MRA = rheumatoid vasculitis), giant cell arteritis (GCA), and polyarteritis nodosa (PN). We found that the following seven genes are commonly unpregulated in the PBMCs of many of these vasculitis patients regardless of their symptoms: early growth response 1 (EGR1), G0/G1 switch gene 2 (G0S2), hemoglobin delta (HBD), amphiregulin (also known as AREG), interleukin-1 receptor type II (IL1R2), calgranulin C, and a novel gene named TVAS10. Of these genes, we selected G0S2 for further analysis because its physiological functions are poorly understood. We prepared anti-G0S2 antibodies and then generated G0S2 transgenic mice and examined their phenotype. We propose that the vasculitis gene markers we identified here may be useful for the future diagnosis of vasculitis.2. Materials and methods2.1. Human subjects and ethical considerationsAll systemic vasculitis patients used in this study were diagnosed according to a previously documented proposal (the ACR criteria and the CHCC criteria).1 This study was reviewed and approved by the Internal Review Board of the Research Institute for Microbial Diseases, Osaka University. Accordingly, written informed consent was obtained from all participants before their PBMCs were obtained. Serum samples were consecutively obtained regardless of the patient's symptom, active, or inactive phase.2.2. Statistical analysisSignificant differences were determined by using Mann–Whitney U-test (Figs. 1 and 2B, Supplementary Fig. S1). The data are expressed as means ± SE. P-value of <0.05 or <0.01 was considered to be statistically significant.mRNA expression of selected TAS/TAC genes in the PBMCs from individual vasculitis patients and normal volunteers. qRT–PCR analyses show that (A) EGR1 (TAC-1), (B) G0S2 (TAC-40), (C) HBD (TAC-106), (D) Amphiregulin (TAC-9), and (E) TVAS10 (TAC-30) are generally upregulated in the PBMCs of vasculitis patient (circles) but not in the PBMCs of normal volunteers (triangles). Each symbol denotes the mean value of a sample analyzed in triplicate. The leftmost filled circle signifies an RNA sample from the PBMCs of a healthy volunteer (male, age 52), which was used as a standard sample and whose expression level was set to 1.0. It allowed us to compare all of the expression profiles tested in this study. Average ± SE values of the vasculitis patient and normal volunteer groups are shown in the right-hand graphs and differ significantly (P < 0.01).mRNA expression of selected TAS/TAC genes in the PBMCs from individual vasculitis patients and normal volunteers. qRT–PCR analyses show that (A) EGR1 (TAC-1), (B) G0S2 (TAC-40), (C) HBD (TAC-106), (D) Amphiregulin (TAC-9), and (E) TVAS10 (TAC-30) are generally upregulated in the PBMCs of vasculitis patient (circles) but not in the PBMCs of normal volunteers (triangles).

(A) Of the 61 mice tested in the first trial, six G0S2 transgenic mouse lines were generated. They all died except for the GTG1b line, which was not useful for further analysis because the human G0S2 gene was introduced on the Y chromosome; consequently, this mouse only produced male G0S2 transgenic mice. (B) Of the 22 mice tested in the third trial, three G0S2 transgenic mouse lines were generated. The only surviving GTG3a line is now under large scale propagation to establish a strain.Family tree of G0S2 transgenic mice.

Transgene vector construction and production of G0S2 transgenic miceTo construct the transgene vector pCX-G0S2, the human G0S2 ORF was cloned from a SLE cDNA library4 by PCR with the EcoRI site-bearing primers G0S2-EcoRI-5'F (5'-TATGAATTCGCCACCATGGAAACGGTCCAGGAGCTGATC-3') and G0S2-EcoRI-3'R (5'-ATAGAATTCCTAGGAGGCGTGCTGCCGGTTGGAC-3'). The G0S2-EcoRI-5'F primer contains the Kozak sequence ahead of the start codon of G0S2 cDNA, whereas the G0S2-EcoRI-3'R primer contains the stop codon of G0S2 cDNA. The sequence of the amplified product was confirmed by DNA sequencing. As previously described,7 the EcoRI-digested fragment of the amplified G0S2 ORF was inserted into the EcoRI site of the pCAGGS expression vector, which possesses a chicken β-actin promoter and a cytomegalovirus enhancer (CMV-IE enhancer). The resulting construct was designated pCX-G0S2. To prepare the G0S2 fragment bearing the chicken β-actin promoter and the CMV-IE enhancer for injection into fertilized eggs, the SalI/HindIII fragment of pCX-G0S2 was purified by electrophoresis and agarose gel extraction. The G0S2 transgenic embryos and mice were generated according to previously described protocols.7 Briefly, the purified DNA fragments were injected into B6D2F1× B6D2F1 fertilized eggs. The incorporation of the transgene was examined by the genomic PCR analysis using DNA extracted from the tail and the pCX-G0S2-1685F (5'-GCTGGTTGTTGTGCTGTCTCATCA-3') and pCX-G0S2-2161R (5'-GCCAGAAGTCAGATGCTCAAGGGGCTTCA-3') primers. The PCR conditions involved TaKaRa Ex Taq polymerase (Takara, Shiga, Japan) and a pre-heating step (95°C for 2 min), 30 reaction step cycles (95°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s, 72°C for 1 min), and a final elongation step (72°C for 5 min). The founder mice were mated with C57BL/6 mice and both the transmittance of the transgene and the successful expression of human G0S2 protein were examined by western blot analysis of total cell extracts of mouse tails using one of the anti-G0S2 monoclonal antibodies (clone #3-1) we generated (see section 3.4 and Supplementary Fig. S2).2.4. Histological examinationC57BL/6 mice were purchased from Japan SLC (Hamamatsu, Japan). Mouse tissues were fixed immediately after removal with 4% paraformaldehyde, then embedded in paraffin, and cut into sections (4 µm thick). Some sections were stained with hematoxiln and eosin according to standard procedures, whereas others were stained with the clone #3-1 monoclonal anti-G0S2 antibody according to the previously described procedure.8 To evaluate the immunostain, sections of the same organs from G0S2-TG and C57BL/6 mice were processed at the same time. When the immunoreactive signals in the former sections were substantially stronger than those in the latter, they were considered to indicate the exogenic G0S2 proteins produced from the transgene.2.5. In situ hybridizationSections were processed in the Genostaff laboratory (Tokyo, Japan) by using the DIG RNA labeling and detection kits (Roche Diagnostics, Mannheim, Germany). Briefly, G0S2 antisense and sense (negative control) RNA probes were prepared by in vitro transcription of the pBluescript vector containing the full-length human G0S2 cDNA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Hybridized signals were colored blue with 4-nitro blue tetrazolium chloride and 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-phosphate as a substrate of alkaline phosphatase. The sense probe did not yield any significant stains. Further information concerning the in situ hybridization (ISH) method is available on request.2.6. Serologic examinationApproximately 200 µl of peripheral blood per mouse were collected from the orbital plexus under anesthesia and were left for 1 h to coagulate. After centrifugation, ∼20 µl sera were obtained. The sera were frozen at −20°C and sent to the Mitsubishi Kagaku BCL laboratory (Tokyo, Japan), where each serum was diluted 500 times and analyzed for the levels of anti-nuclear and anti-double strand (ds) DNA antibodies by fluorescent antibody tests or enzyme immunoassays.3. Results3.1. Identification of vasculitis-specific genes by stepwise subtraction and DNA microarray analysisTo isolate the putative vasculitis-specific genes that are commonly upregulated in the PBMCs of vasculitis patients, we first used our stepwise subtractive hybridization method. PBMC samples were obtained from vasculitis patients (50 patients in total) regardless of the patient's symptom, active, or inactive phase, and a cDNA library was prepared from their pooled mRNAs by the linker-primer method using a pAP3neo vector.9 Stepwise subtractive hybridization was then performed using the biotinylated pooled mRNAs from the PBMCs of eight normal volunteers, as described previously.6 This generated a library of genes that are upregulated in only vasculitis PBMCs. To examine whether these genes are actually upregulated in vasculitis but not normal PBMCs, we performed northern blot analysis using the pooled mRNAs from the vasculitis and normal PBMCs (Fig. 3A). For the cDNA clones whose expression levels were too low for detection by northern blot analysis, we examined their expression in vasculitis and normal PBMCs by RT–PCR (Fig. 3B). The 29 genes that were confirmed to be upregulated in vasculitis patients were called TAS after transcript augmented in vasculitis isolated by stepwise-subtraction. The TAS genes and their accession numbers are summarized in Table 1.mRNA expression levels of the TAS genes. Individual TAS genes were subjected to northern blot (A) or RT–PCR (B) analysis to confirm they are upregulated in the PBMCs of 50 vasculitis patients (A) but not in the PBMCs of eight normal volunteers (N). Table 1 provides the names of the TAS genes. GAPDH was also analyzed as a loading control. The annealing temperature for RT–PCR was always 58°C and amplification occurred over 30 cycles. The sequences of the primers used to identify the TAS genes are presented in Supplementary Table S1.mRNA expression levels of the TAS genes.

The underlined genes were subjected to qRT–PCR to determine their generality of expression in vasculitis patients but not normal volunteers (Fig. 3).To increase the number of putative vasculitis-specific genes, we also performed a genome-wide complementary DNA microarray analysis using the Agilent Hu44K array with the same pooled vasculitis and normal PBMC RNA samples. When we tested the top 402 genes from the microarray list of vasculitis-upregulated genes (data not shown) by RT–PCR, we identified 63 genes whose expression levels are dramatically upregulated in vasculitis patient PBMCs (Fig. 4). We called them TAC after transcript augmented in vasculitis isolated by cDNA-microarray. The TAC genes and their accession numbers are summarized in Table 2. Dual specificity phosphatase 1 (DUSP1) and IL1R2 were identified by both methods. Of the 92 TAS and TAC genes, 30 genes are uncharacterized genes. These are designated as TVAS after transcript increased in vasculitis.mRNA expression levels of the TAC genes.

Expression profiles of vasculitis-upregulated genes in individual patientsTo determine whether these vasculitis-specific candidate genes are indeed upregulated in patients suffering from WG, MPA, TA, AGA, MRA, GCA, or PN and thus are general markers of vasculitis, we subjected 25 of the TAS and TAC genes (underlined in Tables 1 and 2) to quantitative RT–PCR (qRT–PCR) using PBMC RNA samples from indicated numbers of individual vasculitis patients and normal volunteers as negative controls (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). In every qRT–PCR, a standard RNA (denoted as normal with a relative intensity of 1.0) from the PBMCs of a healthy volunteer (male, age 52) was used (see the leftmost filled circle in Fig. 1A–E); this allowed us to compare the expression profiles of the genes tested in this study. It also allowed us to compare the expression profiles of the genes in this study with those of other genes tested in our previous studies on SLE4 and RA.5 With this experiment, we expected to isolate those genes that are highly expressed not only in many vasculitis patients but also in patients with SLE4 and RA;5 the identification of such marker genes may be useful as sensitive and specific diagnostic tools.Of the 25 TAS/TAC genes tested, TAC-1 [early growth responses 1 (EGR1)] was one of the most strongly upregulated genes commonly in the PBMCs of many vasculitis patients, as 96% of patients expressed this gene at 3–300-fold higher levels than healthy volunteers (Fig. 1A). EGR1 encodes a zinc finger transcription factor whose expression is induced within minutes upon the reception of growth stimuli; its expression then decays within a few hours. It promotes cellular differentiation along a macrophage lineage.10 It also plays a critical role in the response to both acute and chronic vascular stress by inducing the expression of several gene products linked to cellular perturbation. This is particularly true for the cellular perturbation in the vasculature that is induced by hypoxia, ischemia/reperfusion, atherosclerosis, and acute vascular injury.11 It remains unclear whether the induction of EGR1 in vasculitis is a pathogenic response or merely results from vascular stress. Nonetheless, EGR1 may serve as a gene marker for the diagnosis of vasculitis.TAC-40 (G0S2) is a lymphocyte G0/G1 switch gene that encodes a putative cell cycle inhibitor whose expression may be required before cells become committed to enter the G1 phase of the cell cycle.12 Nearly, half of the vasculitis patients showed >20-fold increased expression, whereas the expression of most of the normal volunteers was much lower (Fig. 1B). Notably, relative to healthy controls, G0S2 expression is also enhanced in the PBMCs from patients with other autoimmune diseases, namely SLE4 and RA.5 Microarray and qRT–PCR analyses also showed that G0S2 is upregulated in the PBMCs from psoriasis patients suffering from severe generalized disease.13 Thus, it may be interesting to analyze G0S2 further, as it may shed light on the pathogenesis of vasculitis at the molecular level (see below).Nearly 77% of the vasculitis patients expressed 3–16-fold more TAC-106 (HBD) mRNA than the normal volunteers (Fig. 1C). HBD is a minor type of hemoglobin (it makes up only 2–3% of adult hemoglobin) that forms a complex with α-hemoglobin called hemoglobin A2 (α2δ2).14 Although high HbA2 levels are diagnostic for the β-thalassemia trait, its relevance to vasculitis pathology is unknown. Nonetheless, it may be useful as a diagnostic gene marker for vasculitis.Amphiregulin is one of the epidermal growth factor (EGF)-like growth factors that stimulate cell growth by activating the EGF receptor signaling of target cells in an autocrine/juxtacrine fashion.15 We previously reported that Amphiregulin expression is enhanced in the PBMCs of some patients with SLE4 and RA.5 However, compared with SLE and RA patients, a far smaller proportion of vasculitis patients show enhanced Amphiregulin expression (Fig. 1D). Thus, Amphiregulin may be more significant as a DNA marker for SLE and RA than for vasculitis.TAC30 (=TVAS10) encodes an uncharacterized novel protein that is composed primarily of an ankyrin repeat, which is one of the most frequently observed amino-acid motifs and is important for protein–protein interactions.16 About a half of the vasculitis patients showed 10–200-fold increased expression of TAC30, whereas healthy volunteers showed very low expression except for one case (Fig. 1E).Interleukin-1 (IL1), a principal macrophage-derived cytokine, plays a pivotal role in the immuno-inflammatory process by triggering cell activation via its type I receptor (IL1R1); in contrast, its type II receptor (IL1R2) lacks the intracellular domain for IL1 signaling and functions as a potent, specific, and natural inhibitor of IL1 by acting as a decoy receptor.17 About half of the vasculitis patients showed 20–50-fold IL1R2 expression (one patient showed ∼300-fold expression), whereas healthy volunteers showed very low expression except for one case (Supplementary Fig. S1A). This increased expression of IL1R2 may be related to the vascular inflammation of the vasculitis patients.Three phagocyte-specific S100 proteins called calgranulin- A, -B, and -C act separately during calcium-dependent signaling. In particular, TAS1-191 (calgranulin C) secretion by tumor necrosis factor (TNF)- stimulated granulocytes causes target cell activation that results in the upregulated expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as TNF and IL1β; the TNF that is released may then stimulate granulocytes to secrete more calgranulin C, thereby establishing a self-amplifying positive feedback loop.18 About 30% of vasculitis patients showed 10–50-fold calgranulin C expression (one patient showed ∼150-fold expression), whereas most of the healthy volunteers showed low expression (Supplementary Fig. S1B). In contrast, the vasculitis patients and normal volunteers did not differ in their expression of calgranulin B (TAS2-047) (data not shown).3.3. Expression pattern of TAS/TAC genes in PBMCWe previously reported that G0S2 was primarily expressed in monocytes, whereas Amphiregulin was expressed in both monocytes, T cells and B cells by performing RT–PCR on multiple-tissue cDNA panels (MTC) from Clontech (Palo Alto, CA).5 To determine whether EGR1, HBD, TVAS10, IL1R2, and calgranulin C are also expressed in particular human blood cells, we conducted similar experiments. As shown in Fig. 5, EGR1 and IL1R2 were expressed ubiquitously in all lanes, albeit with varying intensities. cDNA from placenta, which also contains many blood cells, served as a control. All genes except calgranulin C were strongly expressed in activated CD4+ T cells (lane 8) and weakly expressed in activated mononuclear cells (aMNCs) (lane 7). Only EGR1 and TVAS10 were expressed in activated CD8+ T (lane 9) cells. EGR1, TVAS10, IL1R2, and calgranulin C were expressed in resting CD8+ T cells (T-suppressor/cytotoxic; lane 2) and monocytes (lane 4). These observations together indicate that these vasculitis-upregulated genes have similar expression profiles. Unfortunately, we could not perform this analysis on vasculitis patients because of the low numbers of PBMCs that we could obtain from the patients.Determination of the human blood cells that express EGR1, HBD, TVAS10, IL1R2, and calgranulin C (Cal C). RT–PCR was performed by using the multiple-tissue cDNA panel for human blood fractions (MTC, Clontech). GAPDH was also amplified as a loading control.

Preparation of transgenic mice that overexpress G0S2We selected G0S2 for further analysis because little is known about its physiological significance and function. To explore the physiological significance of G0S2, we prepared transgenic mice that overexpress the human gene for G0S2. For this purpose, we constructed plasmid DNA in which human G0S2 cDNA lies directly downstream of the beta-actin promoter, as described previously.7 This construct was used to generate transgenic mouse lines that express human G0S2 protein in all tissues. The successful generation of these transgenic mice was confirmed by PCR and/or western blot analysis using DNA or cell extracts obtained from the tail. Expression of G0S2 protein was confirmed by the monoclonal antibody (#3-1) we prepared here (see Supplementary Result and Fig. S2). Although the transgenic mice did not exhibit an obvious phenotype, they seemed to be unhealthy as they did not produce large numbers of offspring. This made it very difficult to establish this transgenic mouse line. For example, in the first attempt to generate this line, 61 mice were tested by PCR for expression of human G0S2. Of these, three female and three male mice were found to bear the transgene (GTG1a-f, see Fig. 2). However, the GTG1f female mouse died soon after birth and the GTG1e female and GTG1c male mice died 3 and 1 months after birth, respectively (Supplementary Fig. S4A). Moreover, while the surviving female transgenic mouse (GTG1d) produced one female transgenic mouse, which safely grew to adulthood, the mother died during her next pregnancy. Her daughter also died during her first pregnancy. In addition, the surviving male mouse GTG1b only produced male transgenic mice when mated with wild-type B6 female mice because the human G0S2 gene was introduced into the Y chromosome. Thus, this mouse could not be used further. Furthermore, the remaining surviving male mouse, GTG1a, did not produce transgenic mouse when mated with wild-type B6 female mice. Thus, we failed to establish a human G0S2-expressing transgenic strain in this trial. The second trial did not generate any transgenic mice. However, in the third trial, of the 22 mice examined by PCR (Fig. 6A) and western blot analysis (Fig. 6B), we found three transgenic mice, of which one (GTG3a) produced offspring (see Supplementary Fig. S4B). These mice appear to be healthier than the other transgenic mice and consequently we have been able to maintain this line probably due to lower G0S2 levels than other transgenic mice. Thus, the exogenous and ubiquitous overexpression of human G0S2 seems to make the transgenic mice unhealthy and inhibits their production of offspring.Establishment of G0S2 transgenic mice.

Human G0S2 expression patterns in transgenic miceTo examine the expression patterns of exogenous human G0S2 in various transgenic mouse tissues, we first performed ISH analysis. As shown in some representative pictures (Fig. 6C), high-level expression of G0S2 mRNA was detected in various organs and tissues. The signals in the urinary tubule, gastric foveola, and esophageal mucosa were distributed in epithelial clumps (Fig. 6Ci–iii). In contrast, scattered or diffusely distributed signals were detected in the cardiac ventricle, gastric smooth muscle, and seminiferous tubule (Fig. 6Civ–vi).Immunohistochemical analysis using the monoclonal antibody (#3-1) also detected exogenously expressed human G0S2 proteins in various organs and tissues of the transgenic mice. As shown in some representative pictures (Fig. 6D), the cellular distribution pattern of these proteins was similar to that of exogenous G0S2 mRNA (Fig. 6C). In the kidney, although most urinary tubule epithelia were weakly positive for G0S2, other epithelia expressed this protein at high levels; the latter epithelia also existed in clumps (Fig. 6Di). A similar patchy distribution of strong G0S2 signals was detected in the foveolar epithelia of the stomach (Fig. 6Dii). In the lung and heart, there was a scattered distribution of exogenous G0S2 signals in the alveolar epithelium and a diffuse distribution in cardiac ventricular muscle, respectively (Fig. 6Diii and iv).3.6. Phenotypes of G0S2 transgenic miceTo explore the phenotypes of the G0S2 transgenic mouse, we first subjected various organs of G0S2 transgenic mice and wild-type (C57BL/6) mice to histological examination. Obvious histopathological findings that related directly to vasculitis were not observed. Notably, microabscess-like panniculitis lesions were detected in the dermis and subcutaneous fat tissue (Fig. 7A). Of the eight TG mice examined, such lesions were detected in three. We also measured the serum levels of two autoimmunity-related antibodies, namely, anti-nuclear antibody (ANA) and anti-dsDNA antibody. We found both were increased in G0S2 TG mice: the OD490 for ANA in the transgenic mice was 0.359 ± 0.170 [compared with 0.219 ± 0.044 for wild-type (B6) mice], whereas the OD490 for anti-dsDNA antibody was 0.294 ± 0.090 (compared with 0.188 ± 0.038 in wild-type mice) (Fig. 7B). However, these differences did not reach statistical significance, in part, because of the limited number of G0S2 TG mice we could use for these measurements. Taken together, it appears that G0S2 may participate in the pathogenesis of autoimmune diseases in general, and in particular, it may be related to inflammation.Histological and serological phenotypes of G0S2-TG mice.

DiscussionIn the present study, we report candidate gene markers for vasculitis that may be useful for diagnosing and understanding the basic pathogenesis of vasculitis and other autoimmune diseases such as SLE. These genes were identified by stepwise subtraction and cDNA microarray techniques, which permitted us to comprehensively isolate the genes that show augmented mRNA expression in the PBMCs of vasculitis patients when compared with normal volunteers. The vasculitis-specific upregulation of these genes was validated with northern blot and/or RT–PCR analyses (Figs 3 and 4, Tables 1 and 2). We then showed by RT–PCR analysis that EGR1, G0S2, HBD, TVAS10, IL1R2, Amphiregulin, and calgranulin C are frequently upregulated in the PBMCs of vasculitis patients (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S1). MTC analysis revealed that in normal PBMCs, these genes are expressed primarily by monocytes and/or activated CD4+ cells (Fig. 5). We also showed previously using different primers and PCR conditions that G0S2 is predominantly expressed by monocytes.5 These results suggest that monocytes, including macrophages, express these vasculitis-upregulated genes and thus may play a role in the pathogenesis of vasculitis.We noticed that several putative vasculitis-upregulated genes also show upregulated expression in other autoimmune diseases, namely, SLE and RA (Table 3). Of these, EGR1 is particularly interesting as the degree to which it is upregulated in most vasculitis patients is remarkable (Fig. 1A). EGR1 is induced by a variety of cellular stresses, including hypoxia, and may function as a master switch that triggers the expression of numerous key inflammatory mediators. In particular, EGR1 induces a number of gene products that have been linked to cellular perturbation, especially in the vasculature. Moreover, many of these genes are often induced in the PBMCs of patients afflicted with a variety of autoimmune diseases. For example, we showed previously that EGR1 is markedly upregulated in the PBMCs of SLE patients.4 It also plays a critical role in promoting cellular differentiation along a macrophage lineage.10 Nonetheless, EGR1-null mice are viable and develop and grow normally.19 Rigorous analyses will be needed to determine whether the upregulation of EGR1 mRNA in many vasculitis patients is pathogenically significant or merely an associated phenomenon.List of the TAC/TAS genes that also show upregulated expression in PBMCs from SLE and RA patientsThe numbers represent fold change compared with normal volunteers; nc, no conspicuous change between RA and control.List of the TAC/TAS genes that also show upregulated expression in PBMCs from SLE and RA patientsThe numbers represent fold change compared with normal volunteers; nc, no conspicuous change between RA and control.G0S2 also displayed enhanced expression in many vasculitis patients (Fig. 1B). G0S2 was first identified as one of the G0/G1 switch (G0S) genes that are differentially expressed in lymphocytes during their lectin-induced switch from the G0 to the G1 phases of the cell cycle.20G0S2 is one of the genes that is upregulated during normal implantation but its expression is significantly lower in women with endometriosis that is associated with pelvic pain and infertility with implantation failure.21 In a replicative senescence model employing human dermal fibroblasts (HDF), G0S2 expression was upregulated in old HDF cells, which suggests that it participates in senescence.22 Microarray and qRT–PCR analyses of PBMCs from psoriasis patients suffering from severe generalized disease also revealed the upregulation of G0S2.13 Moreover, we showed previously that G0S2 mRNA levels are markedly increased in the PBMCs from patients with the autoimmune diseases SLE4 and RA.5G0S2 is a putative target gene of peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) alpha, which belongs to a group of transcription factors that are involved in numerous processes, including lipid metabolism and adipogenesis. Moreover, it was shown that G0S2 is upregulated after PPARδ activation and that it may be involved in the PPARδ-mediated mitigation of cardiac fibroblast proliferation.23We here generated G0S2-TG mice that ubiquitously overexpress G0S2 proteins (Fig. 6). We showed that these mice are unhealthy as they do not produce many offspring (Fig. 2) and frequently display formations of microabscess-like panniculitis lesions in the dermis and subcutaneous fat tissue (Fig. 7A). The development of these microabscess-like panniculitis lesions may reflect the dysregulation of the murine immune system in these mice. Supporting this is that some of the G0S2-TG mice had augmented levels of immunodeficiency-related anti-nuclear and anti-dsDNA antibodies in their sera (Fig. 7B), although these phenotypes are related not to vasculitis but to SLE. It should be noted, however, that these serum differences did not achieve statistical significance, largely because of the shortage of G0S2-TG mice. It will be necessary to study larger numbers of G0S2-TG mice to confirm this association between G0S2 overexpression and the development of autoimmune features. Should this association be confirmed, the high-quality polyclonal and monoclonal anti-G0S2 antibodies that we produced may be useful as tools (perhaps in enzyme-linked EIA) for diagnosing not just vasculitis but also other autoimmune diseases.We performed this study on a highly heterogeneous cohort of patients, including those with systemic vasculitis. All of these diseases share the inflammatory involvement of blood vessels. However, their target organs, pathogenic mechanisms, clinical findings, and outcomes are quite different. Moreover, although the disease activity status in these patients was heterogeneous and some were receiving corticosteroid or immunosuppressive therapy, these factors were ignored in our patient recruitment protocol. Nonetheless, despite these marked heterogeneous features of our patient population, we could isolate putative common genes that are upregulated, which was our original goal. We are currently performing in parallel the expression profiling of the genes that are up- or downregulated in each individual disease and analyzing these profiles in terms of the symptoms, disease activity status, and clinical treatment of the patients. However, the results obtained from such studies are highly complex, which has hampered the identification of candidate gene markers that can be used for diagnosis.Taken together, we conclude that the putative gene markers we identified here, in particular EGR1 and G0S2, may be useful for diagnosing not only vasculitis but also other autoimmune diseases, perhaps by qRT–PCR and antibody-based methods. Other, as yet uncharacterized, genes that we detected as being upregulated in vasculitis may also be useful candidate gene markers and thus are worth further detailed analysis. In particular, the identification of the functions of these genes may reveal the hitherto unknown mechanism(s) that underlie the pathogenesis of vasculitis. This in turn may shed light on therapeutic avenues for treating vasculitis.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was primarily supported by a grant-in-aid from the Health Science Research grant from the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan.

IntroductionIf biased mutational pressure is exerted globally and uniformly on all parts of the genome, then local differences in evolution rates can be explained by the negative selection principle of the neutral theory, which implies that ‘functionally less important parts in the genome evolve faster than more important ones’.1 Recent progress in construction of single-gene knockout mutant collections makes it possible to determine the essentiality of each gene in any bacterium that can be cultured.2 If evolution rates could be estimated in a defensible and consistent manner, the implication of the neutral theory might be tested by comparing estimates conditioned on essentiality. But if the evolutionary histories of bacterial genes were so transparent, then it would be easy to identify the ones acquired from foreign donors by horizontal gene transfer (HGT).HGT detection has been pursued by phylogenetic methods, based on sequence alignment, and by composition-based methods3,4 that involve alignment-free features such as G + C content, synonymous codon usage (SCU) and the frequencies of overlapping short oligomers. These species-specific features undergo amelioration, the process by which a foreign gene, acquired through HGT, evolves toward the composition of the host genome.5 Anomalous composition will be found in recently acquired genes, especially when they originate in distantly related species, but it will also be observed where amelioration has been retarded. Therefore, if genes are ranked according to dissimilarity with respect to global composition, the highest ranks will be awarded both to recent transfers and to relatively ancient coding sequences that have resisted mutational pressure. Composition-based methods have been criticized for falsely indicating HGT when highly conserved proteins have atypical amino acid compositions.6 The coding sequences of such proteins can undergo amelioration to the extent permitted by SCU—but not much farther. Therefore, we expect to find essential genes among false positives produced by HGT detection methods that operate on compositional features other than SCU.Seminal investigations HGT in Escherichia coli examined G + C content and SCU to identify the ∼17.6% of genes most probably acquired since divergence from Salmonella ∼100 million years ago7 and to distinguish native genes from mobile elements (prophages and transposons).8 After refining the mathematical treatment of context-dependent SCU, Azad and Lawrence9 recently predicted 639 foreign genes in E. coli, reporting a false positive rate of 190/639 = 29.7% that was lower than for any competing method of comparable sensitivity. (False positives were genes >300 bp with homologs in S. enterica LT2.) SCU reflects species-specific preferences that are strongly correlated with gross cellular amounts of isoaccepting tRNAs,10 especially in highly expressed genes,8 without regard to function. Though driven by genome-wide mutational pressure on G + C, especially at the third codon position, these preferences are not selection-neutral,11 and false positives may reflect the retarded amelioration of SCU in lowly expressed genes.It has been theorized that higher order compositional features are inherently more species-specific than lower order features12–14 and hence that tetranucleotide frequencies, computed without reference to a reading frame, convey more useful information than G + C content and SCU for purposes like fragment classification and HGT detection.3,12–14 This claim could be reconciled with the implication of the neutral theory if higher order features ameliorate more rapidly and uniformly than lower order features. For example, dinucleotide composition can be mathematically decomposed into two parts: (i) the mononucleotide composition and (ii) the matrix of ‘odds ratios’ that compare the observed proportions of the individual dinucleotides to their expectations under the assumption of pure randomness.15 Nakashima et al.16 examined 10 complete genomes and concluded that part (ii) reflects phylogenetic relations better than part (i). The strand-invariant form of this feature is the dinucleotide relative abundance (DRA) profile which was called a ‘genomic signature’ by Karlin and Burge17 because an organism can generally be identified by computing it from any 50 kb or longer segment.18DRA ratios thus exhibit species-specificity, approaching their global values in all sufficiently long segments of any single genome, but varying greatly between distant relatives. This phenomenon is unexplained19 but it could obviously be a consequence of the relatively rapid and uniform amelioration of genes with respect to DRA. The possibility of inferring HGT from anomalous dinucleotide composition was tested early on the path toward development of better methods and subsequent investigations have used this feature to establish a performance baseline.3,9,20 We propose a new statistical procedure to assess the possibility that DRA ratios approach their global means more uniformly than G + C proportions in segments of bacterial genomes. If a compositional feature ameliorates uniformly, then its intra-genomic variability will be bounded within certain limits embodied in a null hypothesis of homogeneity as formulated below. After testing this hypothesis in several bacterial species, the most anomalous segments of the E. coli K12 sequence are subjected to a phylogenetic analysis to identify false positives (by the noted criteria10) which are subsequently checked for essentiality with reference to published data.22. Materials and methodsFor example, the 10 non-redundant components of ρ* present 6 degrees of freedom, as remarked by Russell and Subak-Sharpe.24 Note that the symmetrized mononucleotide composition is completely determined by the G + C proportions. Since χ2-tests are meaningless unless degrees of freedom are exact, we verified these claims [Equation (3)] by Monte Carlo calculations.25 Each trial begins with random matrix [φxy], each count nxy is a Poisson random number with expected value nφxy, and the three X* statistics are computed. After 2000 trials, the average value of each X* statistic is within ±0.15 of the specified degrees of freedom, and the probability integral transformations yield numbers that are uniformly distributed on the unit interval.Starting with the published sequence of a bacterial chromosome, a window of length 1000 bp (1 kb) is displaced in increments of 1 kb from left to right (5′ to 3′), but not wrapping around to overlap the origin on the last displacement. Each window produces three X* statistics which obey Equation (2), as illustrated for the E. coli K12 sequence (NCBI reference sequence number NC_000913.2) in Fig. 1, where the sum of the two statistics on the right side of Equation (2) is evidently close to the value on the left, and the mean absolute difference (MAD) is only 3.4%. But each statistic commonly exceeds its null degrees of freedom (the expected value) by a large amount, as shown in Fig. 2, and many of them exceed the 99.5-percentile point of the χ2-distribution that describes the homogeneous case. Large values of X*2 occur in segments with anomalous DRA. This statistic, henceforth called the DRA-divergence, exceeds the 99.5-percentile of its null distribution in 10.2% of segments. Large values of X*1 occur in segments with anomalous G + C proportions. This statistic, the GC-divergence, exceeds the 99.5-percentile of its null distribution in 34.0% of segments. At the 95-percentile point, the exceedance rates (ERs) are 24.3% for the DRA-divergence and 46.4% for the GC-divergence. On this basis, we see that DRA is less inhomogeneous than G + C.Scatter plot of total chi-squared divergence, on the left side of Equation (2), versus the sum of the statistics on the right side, in 1 kb segments of the E. coli K12 genome.

The line of unit slope through the origin is also drawn.A classic investigation of base compositional structure drew conclusions from two genomes, E. coli and human, and concluded that a viable stochastic model of both would probably fit ‘many or all of genomes’.26 Subsequent research has shown that bacterial genomes have highly variable and idiosyncratic compositions. Thus it is important to examine some other species by the same methods. Escherichiacoli is exceptional in having a nearly uniform mononucleotide composition. We select the linear chromosome of the spirochete Borrelia burgdorferi because it was found most homogeneous in G + C when viewed through windows of a certain size.27 The cyanobacterium Synechocystis was judged to exhibit no detectable replication-associated strand bias.28Mycobacterium tuberculosis is included because it is AT-rich. Except for S. enterica, the other eight genomes in Table 1 are ad hoc choices.

ERs at two percentile points are listed. Averages across all species are shown in the last row.Beyond statistical analysis by the method just described, we want to know if coding sequences undergo amelioration with respect to DRA at a rate that is relatively unaffected by essentiality. Accordingly, the 1 kb segments of the E. coli K12 sequence that are most anomalous in DRA-divergence are subjected to a phylogenetic analysis. The 20 highest ranking segments (largest DRA-divergences) are placed in serial order in Table 3. Each segment overlaps zero, one or two genes in the protein table of the current annotation. (We suppose that HGT typically involves segments longer than 1 kb.) Horizontal transfer (HT) is indicated by ‘M’ when the gene is pro-phage, phage-like, an insertion element or other documented Mobile element. Otherwise, the translated coding sequence is retrieved from EcoCyc29 and its best alignment in S. enterica (all complete genomes) is found by tBLASTn (via the National Center for Biotechnology website with default parameters) and the corresponding E-value is noted.30,31 If E > 0.1, the alignment is attributed to chance, and ‘+1’ is entered in the HT column to indicate true positive. If E ≤ 0.1 then the alignment is significant, the gene is assumed to have been inherited from the common ancestor, and the symbol ‘−1’ is entered in the HT column to indicate false positive. False positives are checked against the list of 302 essential gene candidates that were located on the chromosome of substrain MG1655 by testing knockout mutants.2 When a false positive is an essential gene, ‘−1’ in the HT column is replaced by the abbreviated gene name (locus).Characterizing the 20 most anomalous 1 kb segments of the E. coli K12 genome based on dinucleotide signature dissimilarity as measured by (a) DRA-divergence, (b) delta-distance, (c) Euclidean distance and (d) the quadratic discriminantEach segment, indexed by location (loc.) in kb from the published origin, overlaps zero, one or two genes in the protein table. Intergenic segments are classified as ‘0’.

Statistical analysis of compositional divergence in 12 bacterial speciesStatistical analysis of 1 kb segments of the E. coli K12 sequence showed that DRA is more homogeneous than G + C. The same conclusion holds for the 11 other species in Table 1, as shown in Table 2, in so far as ERs at the 95- and 99.5-percentile points of the χ2-distributions are higher for GC-divergence than for DRA-divergence. This contrast holds in all 12 species despite the fact that mean GC-divergence is less than mean DRA-divergence in four of them. In every case, the χ2 approximation of Equation (1) is defensible, as the MAD between the left and right sides of Equation (2) is <6%. But the variance of these results is wide and our sample is too small to argue that the contrast holds for all bacteria. By extending the analysis to a small, quasi-random sample of species, we have merely verified that the E. coli genome is not exceptional in this respect before exploring it more closely.3.2. Phylogenetic analysis of extreme compositional anomalies in E. coli K12The 20 segments having greatest DRA-divergences are characterized in the first pair (a) of data columns in Table 3. They overlap 19 genes of which 4 are mobile elements and 14 are false positives. The mobile elements include rhsD at location 256.32 (Location is the endpoint in kb from the start of the published sequence.) The one additional true positive, at location 2104, is the β-1,6-galactofuranosyltransferase gene wbbI (locus tag b2034) which leads transcription unit wbbIJK. This gene lacks a homolog in 283 completed genomes of other proteobacteria. The 14 false positives include eight essential genes: yaeT, mukB, rne, infB, rplW, rplD, ftsY and rpoB. The probability of finding one essential gene by chance in a sample of size 1 is 302/4639 ≈ 6.5%; but the binomial probability of finding eight or more essential genes in a sample of 19 is ∼10−5. Large DRA-divergence is thus a strong indicator of essentiality. On the other hand, if 17.6% of E. coli genes are foreign,7 the probability of finding five or more of these (four mobile elements plus one) by chance is roughly 10%, and large DRA-divergence is a weak indicator of HGT. Before attempting to reconcile this outcome with the conclusion drawn from compositional statistics, it seems important to consider some other mathematical discriminants as measures of DRA anomaly.Delta-distance, introduced by Karlin et al. and defined above, has been used to establish a performance baseline as noted in the introduction. The 20 segments having greatest delta-distances from the global signature are characterized in the second pair (b) of data columns of Table 3. They overlap 18 genes of which 4 are mobile elements and 12 are false positives. An apparent contradiction arises in the 20th segment, ending 4474 kb from sequence start, which overlaps (by >300 bp each) two genes, yjgK (b4252) and yjgL (b4253), which encode hypothetical proteins. Classified as a conserved protein in EcoCyc, yjgK has homologs in S. enterica (E < 10−65) and proteobacteria outside the gamma subdivision (E < 10−10); but yjgL is a true positive with no good alignments in other proteobacteria except three species of Shigella which we suppose to be descended from E. coli. The 12 false positives include three essential genes that were previously identified by large DRA-divergence. The probability of finding three or more essential genes in a random sample of size 18 is ∼11%.Euclidean distance in 16-dimensional DRA space has been employed in several investigations. When Euclidean distance is computed in the 10-dimensional space of the non-redundant components of the strand-invariant DRA profile, the 20 most anomalous segments are listed in the third pair (c) of data columns in Table 3. They overlap 18 genes of which six are mobile elements and nine are false positives. Five false positives are essential genes that were previously identified by large DRA-divergence and the corresponding binomial P-value is ∼0.5%.The species-specificity of a minimum Euclidean distance classifier was slightly enhanced by appropriately scaling the components.16 Applied to anomaly detection, a two-way classification problem, the effect of such scaling is to replace a spherical acceptance region with an ellipsoid. General principles of pattern recognition theory suggest that even greater specificity can be achieved by a quadratic discriminant classifier that inscribes more flexible boundaries in 10-dimensional DRA space. We constructed the anomaly detector using standard algorithms to form a quadratic discriminant33 based on the logarithms of the strand-invariant DRA values (log-odds ratios). The 20 most anomalous segments, listed in the fourth pair (d) of data columns in Table 3, overlap 18 genes of which nine are mobile elements and six are false positives. Only two false positives are essential genes and the binomial P-value is 33%. Gene ftsY, which is essential for septation, is found anomalous by this and every discriminant considered previously. The true positives include adjacent, co-oriented genes wbbI and rfc and also yqeK (b2849) which was not discovered previously. Thus, the false positive rate of the most powerful discriminant is 33%, and 33% of false positives are essential. The 50 most anomalous segments identified by the quadratic discriminant contain 5 intergenic regions, 25 mobile elements and 8 essential genes including mukB, rplBWD, rfaK/waaU, ftsN and the two just noted. The binomial P-value for eight essential genes in 45 is <1%.Last, the 20 highest ranking segments with respect to GC-divergence are analyzed. These segments, listed in the right-most pair (e) of columns in Table 3, overlap 21 genes of which five are mobile elements and six are false positives. Segment 4267 overlaps tyrB (b4054), a false positive and an RNA gene (b4621) which is not counted. Segment 3803 produces a contradiction, overlapping rfaB (false positive) and rfaS (true positive). (This is only the second such contradiction in all cases examined.) Segment 3798 contains false positive rfaZ in the AT-rich rfaQGPSBIJYZ-waaU transcription unit; but segment 3797 overlaps true positives waaU and rfaL that are oppositely oriented. The sole essential gene on this list is waaU (also known as rfaK) which has significant alignments in several proteobacteria outside the gamma subdivision. No essential genes are found among the six false positives. Large values of the GC-divergence thus predict HGT with the same false positive rate as the most powerful (quadratic) discriminant based on DRA-divergence but do not mistake essentiality for foreignness so often.3.3. Compositional divergences in segments overlapping the essential genesThe 20 largest values of DRA-divergence in 1 kb segments of the E. coli K12 chromosome pointed to a significant number of essential gene candidates. Is DRA-divergence generally elevated in segments that contain essential genes? To answer this question, the mid-points of the coding sequences of essential gene candidates2 are calculated, and each mid-point identifies a single segment. Mean divergences in these 302 ‘essential segments’ are shown in Table 4 and compared with corresponding genome-wide averages for all segments and for non-essential segments. Mean DRA-divergence is elevated, whereas the others are depressed, with reference to the third row where differences (n − e) are noted. The same pattern is followed by ER-95% and ER-99.5%. These ERs where higher for GC-divergence than for DRA-divergence, when all segments were considered, for all 12 species in Table 2; but this contrast disappears for the essential segments of E. coli.Comparing essential segments of the E. coli sequence to all segments and to non-essential segmentsMean values and ERs of the divergence statistics are computed as in Table 2. The MSR of the divergence in essential segments is tested for significant departure from expected value (0.5) in the bottom row.Comparing essential segments of the E. coli sequence to all segments and to non-essential segmentsMean values and ERs of the divergence statistics are computed as in Table 2. The MSR of the divergence in essential segments is tested for significant departure from expected value (0.5) in the bottom row.The statistical significance of the differences (n − e) in Table 4 is assessed by a non-parametric test procedure. All segments are ranked according to divergence. Under the null hypothesis, essentiality does not influence divergence, and hence the essential segments are uniformly distributed from rank 1 to 4639. Then the mean rank of essential segments is divided by 4639 to obtain the mean scaled rank (MSR) which is nearly normal with expected value equal to 1/2 and standard deviation (SD) = [(1/12)/302]1/2 = 0.0166. The last row of Table 4 shows that MSR > 0.5 for DRA-divergence but <0.5 for the other two components. These differences are expressed in SDs from expected value and the normal P-values for one-sided tests are given. On this basis, DRA-divergence is significantly elevated, but GC-divergence is very significantly depressed, in the essential sample. This conclusion is reinforced by Fig. 3, which portrays the distributions of the divergence components on logarithmic axes. The non-essential sample is described by solid squares that mark the means, medians and labeled percentile points of the empirical distributions (not referred to χ2), whereas the essential sample is described by solid circles. As each circle lies above and to the left of the corresponding square, the essential sample distribution is evidently shifted lower with respect to GC-divergence, but higher with respect to DRA-divergence.Comparing observed distributions of compositional divergence components in segments of the E. coli K12 genome. Means, medians, and indicated percentile points are plotted for (circles) essential and (squares) non-essential segments. Arrows depict the inferred time course of amelioration as explained in Section 3.4.Comparing observed distributions of compositional divergence components in segments of the E. coli K12 genome. Means, medians, and indicated percentile points are plotted for (circles) essential and (squares) non-essential segments. Arrows depict the inferred time course of amelioration as explained in Section 3.4.3.4. Amelioration of compositional divergencesProceeding from the initial proposition that higher order features ameliorate more rapidly and uniformly than lower order features, we predicted that bacterial genomes are more homogeneous with respect to (second order) DRA than with respect to (first order) G + C when viewed through 1 kb windows. After statistical analysis supported the prediction, we expected to detect recent HGT in segments of the E. coli K12 sequence that are most anomalous with respect to DRA. Instead, large DRA-divergence was a better indicator of essentiality. Can these results be reconciled with the initial proposition?This argument is sketched on Fig. 3 where arrows extend from point T0, representing the divergence coordinates at some time in the past, to points E (essential) and N (non-essential) with the same GC-divergence. In extreme cases, at least one DRA ratio resists mutational pressure so strongly that divergence drops to a floor level and goes no lower. This possibility is represented on Fig. 3 by the arrow branching to point E from T1 that is attained after the less resistant ratios reach equilibrium. Extending this branch much farther will produce a coding sequence that closely matches gross genomic G + C but still exceeds the median of DRA-divergence. Gene ftsY fits this description in so far as its segment (3602) has small GC-divergence (X*1=0.42) and its large DRA-divergence (X*2=61.8) is half accounted for by three terms (for dinucleotides AT, TA and AG + CT).Thus, the simplest explanation of our findings is that G + C typically ameliorates more rapidly than DRA, especially in older and essential parts of the genome, contrary to initial proposition. Finding DRA more homogeneous than G + C appears to contradict this explanation only if it is assumed DRA and G + C are equally divergent between donors and recipients of HT. In this re-interpretation of the data, we argue that the smaller intra-genomic range of DRA merely reflects its smaller inter-genomic range. For example, gross G + C fractions in E. coli and S. enterica differ by ∼2%, and segments of E. coli exhibit 19.9 average GC-divergence from the G + C fraction of S. enterica; but the average DRA-divergence relative to the genomic signature of S. enterica is only 12.4. These genomes appear to have diverged more rapidly in G + C than DRA.3.5. Predicting essential genes based on dinucleotide compositionDRA-divergence was introduced to assess the statistical significance of local deviations from the genomic signature. Other discriminants found fewer essential genes among the 20 most anomalous segments, but none found as few as divergence with respect to G + C, which is not a reliable indicator of horizontal transmission.35 It remains to be explained how HGT detection methods based on higher order signatures can overcome the failure mode predicted by the implication of the neutral theory. The difficulty is implicitly acknowledged when genes belonging to certain functional classes, such as ribosomal proteins, are ‘manually removed’6 from lists of HGT candidates produced by higher order methods.3 Our negative result highlights the challenge of reconciling such methods, which have advanced without explicitly addressing how essential genes impact performance, with principles of molecular evolution. Although we lack an a priori basis for extrapolating our result to higher order, it is evident that the performance level of a method based on DRA is an easy benchmark to exceed. Approaching the problem from the opposite perspective, it could be useful to screen out essential genes before proceeding with the search for HGT. Our analysis may suggest that DRA-divergence could serve this purpose. When all 1 kb segments of the E. coli K12 sequence are ranked by DRA-divergence, 42 essential segments are among the 302 highest ranks. The expected number is only (302)2/4639 ≈ 20 and the binomial P-value is ∼10−6. But the success rate of 42/302 ≈ 14% seems disappointing even though it is highly significant.Various refinements could raise the success rate. The divergence quotient (DRA divided by GC) could be a stronger indicator of essentiality. A sliding window should improve the compositional contrast between essential and non-essential segments. (Our analysis used fixed length, non-overlapping windows to simplify statistical comparisons.) Essential coding sequences could become more detectable based on the 9 degrees of freedom divergence statistic (denoted by X2 in Section 2) computed from the 16 strand-dependent odds ratios.These suggestions aside, we doubt that any single composition-based method can reliably predict essential genes. DRA ratios are determined by the amino acid sequence and SCU. Our methods and results do not illuminate how much of the central tendency of DRA is explained by species-specific codon usage patterns nor how much of the variance is driven by differing expression levels that are independent of essentiality. Predicting essential genes may be as difficult as detecting HTs, but progress can be measured more directly, as new experimental methods identify essential genes without revealing their evolutionary histories.FundingThis research was supported by the MKE (Ministry of Knowledge Economy), Korea, under the ITFSIP supervised by the IITA."

IntroductionEscherichia coli is one of the most widely used organisms for the industrial production of recombinant proteins, amino acids and other chemical products.1–5 But it is necessary to remove some regulatory mechanisms such as depression by the product to improve its productivity.6 Furthermore, there are >400 function unknown genes.7 Reducing dispensable genome regions may decrease such complicated regulatory mechanisms and function unknown genes. Functional analysis and modeling, therefore, may be easier. Several groups have already established E. coli cells with fewer genes.8–11 Also, reduced genomes have been designed mainly in silico using gene annotations and information from comparative or functional genomics to identify minimal gene sets.9,10 Hashimoto et al.10 eliminated regions between essential genes as much as possible. Sixteen regions with a total length of 1.38 Mb were deleted from the E. coli K-12 MG1655 chromosome, the resulting strain being designated as Δ16. Although the genome size of Δ16 is the smallest, it exhibits an aberrant cell morphology and an increased doubling time relative to the number of deletions. Alternatively, Pósfai et al.11 selected strain-specific genomic regions as deletion targets by comparing six sequenced E. coli genomes. Forty-three segments were sequentially deleted from the MG1655 chromosome, resulting in 0.71 Mb genome reduction. The resulting strain, MDS43, had lost all mobile elements such as insertion sequences (ISs) and prophages. A related MDS41 strain with 41 deletions showed 20–25% lower mutation than the wild type because of its IS-free genotype. This strain as well as MG1655 exhibited good growth in minimal medium. Another strain, MDS42, with 42 deletions exhibited twice the electroporation efficiency of MG1655. The in silico design for MDS strains worked well to produce reduced genome strains with unique properties; however, to reduce the genome more than that of MDS43, it is necessary to delete common genomic regions of several E. coli strains.12 The opportunity of managing growth is higher in common regions, which include multiple metabolic pathway and regulatory genes. Single-gene knockout mutants have been constructed but little is known about how much each of those affects the growth of E. coli in minimal medium.13 Furthermore, little is known about the cumulative effects of deletions.Here, we report construction of a reduced genome E. coli cell by assessing the growth on M9 minimal medium of all intermediate deletion mutants. In order to maintain robust cell growth, only deletions that did not affect cell growth were used to construct a reduced genome strain. The total length of the eliminated regions was 1 Mb, and the resulting strain was designated as MGF-01. MGF-01 showed unexpected but beneficial growth on M9 minimal medium. We believe this strain can be used as a tool for functional analysis of E. coli and as a host for industrial production.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains and growth conditionsEscherichiacoli strain KM22 with recBCD genes replaced by λ Red recombination functions (ΔrecBCD::Plac-bet exo kan) was obtained from Dr Kenan C. Murphy.14 A chromosomal region including λ Red genes was introduced into wild-type strain W3110, using P1 transduction, the resulting strain being designated as W3110red (W3110 ΔrecBCD::Plac-bet exo kan). A l-threonine production strain was constructed by replacing the homoserine O-succinyltransferase gene, metA, with the desensitized (canceled feedback regulation of l-threonine) aspartokinase/homoserine dehydrogenase gene, thrA345; homoserine kinase gene, thrB; threonine synthase gene, thrC; and chloramphenicol acetyltransferase gene, cat (ΔmetA::thrA345BC cat).15 Luria–Bertani (LB) medium and M9 minimal medium are described elsewhere.16 For the growth test, 10 mg/L FeSO4 20 g/L CaCO3 and 10 g/L glucose were added to the M9 minimal medium. A seed culture was grown at 37°C for 14 h in a test tube containing 5 mL LB medium. Two hundred microliters of seed culture was inoculated into a 300 mL flask with baffles (IWAKI, Tokyo, Japan) containing 20 mL M9 minimal medium. The cultivation conditions were 37°C and 250 rpm. During the cultivation, 5 g/L glucose was added at 20 h to avoid glucose depletion. Two hundred microliters of culture was diluted with 1.8 mL 0.1 N HCl to evaluate growth. For l-threonine production, strains W3110_thr and MGF-01_thr were each grown in a 300 mL flask with baffles containing 20 mL fermentation medium. The fermentation medium was composed of 70 g of glucose, 20 g of (NH4)2SO4, 1 g of KH2PO4, 0.5 g of MgSO4·7H2O, 5 mg of FeSO4·7H2O, 5 mg of MnSO4·4H2O, 2 g of yeast extract, 120 mg of methionine and 30 g/L CaCO3 per liter of water at pH 7.0.62.2. Selection of deletion targetsThe genome sequences of E. coli K-12 MG1655 (accession no. U00096)17 and Buchnera sp. APS (accession no. NC002528)18 were used for comparative genomics, and E. coli unique genes were selected for elimination. Essential genes reported in the PEC database (http://www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/pec/index.jsp) were eliminated as deletion candidates.19 The annotations of the remaining candidates were surveyed in the ERGO databases (http://www.integratedgenomics.com/) to judge their necessity for good growth in M9 minimal medium.20 Regions with more than 10 continuous unnecessary genes were chosen for deletion. These candidate regions for deletion are shown in Supplementary Table S1.2.3. Construction of reduced genome strainsThe details of the used markerless deletion method are given in Supplemental Materials. Single-deletion strains as to each candidate region were prepared using a λ Red recombination system and negative selection marker sacB (markerless deletion method) previously reported (Supplementary Fig. S1, Supplementary Table S1).21 Deletions distributed in 50 kb were integrated to construct deletion-unit strains by continual use of the markerless deletion method (Supplementary Table S2). All single-deletion strains and deletion-unit strains were carefully assessed for growth in M9 minimal medium. Deletions that did not affect growth were integrated to construct multiple-deletion strains (Supplementary Fig. S2). Multiple-deletion strains were also assayed for growth in M9 minimal medium.2.4. Analytical methodsComparative genomic hybridization was performed as described previously.12 Cells were stained using 4,6-diamidino-2-phenylinodole (DAPI) after fixation for fluorescent microscopic observation of chromosomes.22 Supernatants of cultures were used for l-threonine, acetate and glucose quantification. A high-pressure liquid chromatography system with post-column amino acid labeling and detection ‘Prominence’ (SHIMADZU, Kyoto, Japan) was used to quantify l-threonine. A DX 500 Ion Chromatograph System (DIONEX, Tokyo, Japan) was used to quantify acetate and a 7070 Automatic analyzer (HITACHI, Tokyo, Japan) was used to quantify glucose. The flanking regions of deletion sites were amplified by PCR, and sequenced with the Big Dye terminator method and an ABI3700 sequencer.Dual-label microarray experiments with TaKaRa E. coli W3110 custom DNA tip (TAKARA SHUZO, Shiga, Japan) were performed as previously described.23 After 21 h cultivation in M9 minimal medium, RNA was prepared using RNAprotect Bacteria Reagent and RNeasy Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Signal intensity of each spot in the microarray was quantified using GenePix™ Pro 4.0 (Axon Instruments) software. Further data analyses were conducted by using computer software programs, Microsoft® Excel and GeneSpring® 5.0.2 (Silicon Genetics, Redwood, CA, USA). Only genes existed in MGF-01 were used to compare gene expression between MGF-01 and W3110red.3. Results3.1. Candidate regions for deletionDispensable regions of E. coli were selected using comparative genomics between E. coli and Buchnera sp. The species Buchnera sp. was thought to share a common ancestor with E. coli, and this symbiont attained a 0.64 Mb small genome through reduction in its size during evolution.18 Therefore, it was suitable for E. coli to compare genome construction with that of Buchnera sp. to extract candidate regions for deletions. Regions that did not exist in Buchnera sp. were selected. Meanwhile, this symbiont was missing the biosynthesis genes for some amino acids, lipopolysaccharides and phospholipids which were required for growth on M9 minimal medium. Consequently, after eliminating E. coli essential genes from the list of candidates, the list was again checked in order to exclude genes necessary for normal growth on M9 minimal medium. Regions of more than 10 continuous unnecessary genes were chosen as candidate regions for deletion. Using these criteria, 83 regions were selected (Δ001–Δ089 including missing numbers). Furthermore, transporter genes, ISs and toxin–antitoxin pairs were selected, and 20 more regions were designed for deletion (Δ090–Δ109). One hundred and three regions were selected and the total length of the candidates was 1830 kb (Supplementary Table S1).3.2. Construction of an E. coli cell with a reduced genomeWe tried to delete all the target regions by the markerless deletion method. The growth of each deletion mutant was examined by measuring the time-dependent change in cell density and 84 of the 103 deletion mutants showed comparable growth to the wild type. Deletions of normal-growth strains were used for constructing a reduced genome strain. Deletions were accumulated in one strain as described in Fig. 1. Finally, 53 deletions were combined in one strain via 28 cycles of deletion-transfer (Supplementary Fig. S2). This strain was designated as MGF-01. All 53 deletions of MGF-01 and a substitution at the recBCD site, replaced by λ Red recombinase genes, were confirmed by comparative genomic hybridization (Fig. 2). To confirm the construction of each junction, both 1 kb flanking regions of all 53 deletions were sequenced. Comparison of the deletion maps of Δ16, MDS43 and MGF-01 is shown in Fig. 3, and a Venn diagram of Δ16, MDS43 and MGF-01 is shown in Fig. 4. One thousand and eighty-one out of 4396 CDSs were deleted from W3110 to construct MGF-01, and function unknown genes were reduced from 471 to 346 (Supplementary Table S3). Although there are 301 common CDSs deleted in all three strains, unique CDSs were deleted in each strain because deletion targets were selected with different criteria. The total length of deletions in MGF-01 was 1.03 Mb and the GC content of the reduced-size genome was increased by 0.27% and reached to 51.8%.Method used to integrate deletion-units.

Phenotypes of MGF-01Time courses of growth of MGF-01 and W3110red in M9 minimal medium are shown in Fig. 5A. MGF-01 grew as the wild-type strain in the exponential phase and continued growing after the wild-type strain had entered the stationary phase. The final cell density of MGF-01 was 1.5 times higher than that of the wild-type strain. Colony forming units (CFU/mL) of MGF-01 and W3110red at 30 h incubation were 9.6 × 109 and 6.3 × 109, respectively. The glucose consumption speed after 20 h was lower for MGF-01 compared with the wild-type strain despite its higher cell density (Fig. 5B). Under aerobic batch culture conditions, the glucose catabolism of E. coli often overflows, leading to the accumulation of acetate that they inhibit E. coli growth.24 The levels of acetate accumulation in MGF-01 and the wild type were 0.50 and 1.37 g/L, respectively. The correlation among the high cell density, low glucose consumption and low acetate accumulation indicates that MGF-01 may utilize glucose more efficiently than the wild type.Cell density and glucose consumption of MGF-01 in M9 minimal medium.

Diamonds: final cell densities of direct-lineage strains of MGF-01.Chromosomal DNA was stained with DAPI to visualize the intracellular distribution of the chromosome (Fig. 7). The shape of MGF-01 was slightly rounder but there were little prolonged or anucleate cells. The normal cell shape of MGF-01 and the CFU result indicate that the optical density represented the cell density of MGF-01, which was 1.5-fold higher than that of the wild type. The intracellular distribution of the chromosome was apparently the same as in the wild type. Therefore, the growth of MGF-01 was not affected by the multiple deletions from the viewpoints of division and intracellular distribution of the chromosome.Microscopic images of DAPI-stained cells. Cells cultivated in M9 minimal medium were harvested at 11, 15 and 32 h, and stained using DAPI.Microscopic images of DAPI-stained cells. Cells cultivated in M9 minimal medium were harvested at 11, 15 and 32 h, and stained using DAPI.3.4. Threonine production of MGF-01MGF-01 showed good growth in M9 minimal medium. To evaluate the production capability of MGF-01, an l-threonine production unit was introduced. l-Threonine is one of the major amino acids produced in fermentation processes. In the l-threonine biosynthesis pathway, the key enzyme, aspartokinase/homoserine dehydrogenase, encoded by thrA is feedback-regulated and depressed by the product, l-threonine, and a mutation to remove this feedback inhibition has been reported (thrA345).15 The methionine biosynthesis pathway is a branch pathway of l-threonine biosynthesis. To block this route, we substituted metA, which encodes the first enzyme of this branch pathway, by an l-threonine production unit containing the desensitized thrA gene (ΔmetA::thrA345BC_cat). This l-threonine production unit was transferred to W3110red and MGF-01 by P1 transduction, and the resulting strains were designated as W3110red_thr and MGF-01_thr, respectively. The production medium was different from M9 minimal medium, and contained yeast extract (Materials and methods). In this medium, both strains showed higher cell densities than in M9 minimal medium; however, the cell density of MGF-01 was only 1.2 times higher than that of wild type (1.5 times higher in M9 minimal medium). The l-threonine production after 48 h cultivation is summarized in Table 1. Interestingly, the l-threonine production and the yield of MGF-01_thr were 2.44 and 1.69 times higher than those of W3110_thr. A high glucose consumption rate (1.44 times) and a low byproduct (acetate) synthesis rate (0.09 time) contributed to this high productivity and high yield. MGF-01 also showed beneficial properties for l-threonine production.Results of l-threonine productionResults of l-threonine production4. DiscussionIn order to use reduced genome strains for industrial processes, it is necessary to maintain robust growth and the fundamental metabolic mechanism of E. coli. Therefore, we assessed the growth of deletion mutants in M9 minimal medium. Some reduced genome E. coli strains were previously reported; however, the smallest genome E. coli, Δ16, cannot growth in M9 minimal medium.10 MDS41 with a 0.66 Mb reduced genome can grow in M9 minimal medium as well as the wild type.11 MGF-01 with a 1.03 Mb reduce genome in this study can grow in M9 minimal medium. Moreover, the final cell density in M9 minimal medium of MGF-01 was 1.5 times higher than that of W3110red (Fig. 5). This unexpected but beneficial phenotype was not observed for other reduced genome strains.Another distinct phenotype in M9 minimal medium was that the glucose consumption speed of MGF-01 was significantly decreased compared with that of its parental strain, W3110red, after 20 h cultivation instead of its higher cell density (Fig. 5B). MGF-01 accumulated less than half the acetate that W3110red did and this lower acetate accumulation of MGF-01 may contribute to the more efficient glucose assimilation. The low acetate accumulation by MGF-01 may be brought about by the high glyoxylate shunt activity which accelerates acetyl-CoA consumption leading not to acetate but to the TCA cycle.25 The gene expression of glyoxylate shunt-related genes, isocitrate lyase (aceA) and malate synthase (aceB), was 6.9 and 4.7 times higher in MGF-01 than those of W3110red in the DNA microarray analysis. Since repressors of the glyoxylate shunt, aerobic respiration control protein (arcA) and acetate operon repressor (iclR), were not eliminated, other regulatory systems may be deleted in MGF-01.26In l-threonine production medium, MGF-01_thr also showed reduced acetate accumulation from 9.4 g/L (W3110_thr) to 0.85 g/L, and produced twice as much l-threonine as W3110_thr (Table 1). It is known that in an l-threonine production strain, the glyoxylate shunt is activated to provide high amounts of carbon to the l-threonine pathway. Low acetate accumulation and high l-threonine production indicate that the glyoxylate shunt in MGF-01_thr may be activated as in the case of M9 minimal medium.15In M9 minimal medium, glucose consumption was lower than that of the wild type; however, it was higher than that of wild type in l-threonine production medium. This higher glucose consumption rate may be the result of higher l-threonine production by MGF-01_thr. MGF-01 may have higher ability for taking up glucose when there is a sufficient demand such as for l-threonine production. We believe that cellular metabolism may be activated in MGF-01 and glucose is used efficiently for l-threonine production.Our next aims are to determine what combinations of deletions affect growth and l-threonine production of MGF-01, and to construct a strain with a further reduced genome.Supplementary DataSupplementary material is available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThe New Energy and Industrial Technology Development Organization (NEDO).We would like to thank Dr T.

IntroductionThe wild rice species Oryza rufipogon Griff. (AA genome) is the most closely related ancestral species to Asian cultivated rice (O. sativa L.).1,2 It contains various valuable traits with regard to tolerance to cold, drought and salinity. It also contains many quantitative trait loci with agronomic important traits.3,4 However, cultivated rice, which feeds more than half of the world's population, is often threatened by multifarious environmental factors including drought, salinity, cold and other factors. The O. sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare genome has been completely sequenced through a map-based sequencing strategy.5 The draft genome sequence of the O. sativa ssp. indica cv. 93-11 was also generated through a whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach.6 The Rice Full-Length cDNA Consortium collected over 28 000 full-length complementary DNA (FLcDNA) clones from cv. Nipponbare.7 Now, there are >47 000 cultivated rice FLcDNA sequences publicly available (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/). There is also a collection of 10 096 FLcDNAs of O. sativa ssp. indica cv. Guangluai 4.8 Moreover, comparative genome analysis has been developed to decipher the similarity and diversity among rice varieties, using single nucleotide polymorphisms data in 21 rice genomes.9 Comparative analysis with cultivated rice cDNA sequences has also been developed using the microarray method.10 In contrast, for wild rice, there are few batches of mRNAs and FLcDNAs in public databases, with the exception of 5211 leaf ESTs from the O. minuta (BBCC genome).11Oryza rufipogon has been classified into perennial and annual ecotypes.12 W1943 is a perennial O. rufipogon. For the first time, a total of 1888 FLcDNAs of O. rufipogon W1943 were generated in the present study; most (>96.8%) were highly homologous with cultivated rice genome sequences. Furthermore, W1943 had greater similarity to ssp. japonica than to ssp. indica. Additionally, 1% of W1943 FLcDNAs was verified as novel rice genes not previously reported. We also discovered 41 putative tissue-specific expressed genes by applying the rice massively parallel signature-sequencing (MPSS) database.132. Materials and Methods2.1. Plant materials and cDNA library constructionTwo enriched FLcDNA libraries were constructed from wild rice O. rufipogon Griff. W1943. Seeds were germinated and seedlings were grown in a greenhouse with day/night of 13/11 h and 25/30°C. Three weeks after germination, some seedlings were exposed to 5°C and leaves were separately harvested after 0, 1, 12, 24, 48, 72 and 120 h of cold treatment. We constructed two cDNA libraries from 3-week-old rice leaves grown under normal and cold conditions, respectively. All samples were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at −80°C.We constructed two FLcDNA libraries according to the Cap-Tagging8 and Cap-trapper methods.14 The 5′ cap-tagging method utilizes the 5′ cap-capture technique through the combined treatments of calf intestinal phosphatase (CIP) and tobacco acid pyrophosphatase (TAP) so that only the FLcDNA was targeted for library construction. The cap-trapper method is based on chemical introduction of a biotin group into the diol residue of the cap structure of mRNA, which is followed by RNase I treatment to select FLcDNA. Total RNA was isolated using the TRIZOL reagents, and mRNAs were purified with the Oligotex mRNA kit (Qiagen). Double-stranded cDNA was digested with EcoRI (1 U) and XhoI (10 U) for 1 h at 37°C, and cDNA fraction of 0.6–2 kb was collected and pooled, with which ligated to the sites of EcoRI and XhoI of vector pBluescript SK+ (Strategene) at 16°C overnight. Then, cDNA was transformed into competent E. coli DH10B cells (Invitrogen) by electroporation. We assessed the library quality by assaying ligations and carrying out 5′-end sequencing; the former procedure determined library titer, and the latter used to evaluate cDNA full-length percentage as well as the proportion of empty vectors.2.2. DNA sequencing and assemblingDNA sequencing was carried out on ABI3730 sequencers. The clones were sequenced from both ends by the dideoxy chain termination method using BigDye Terminator Cycle sequencing V2.0 Ready Reaction (Applied Biosystems). The Phred base-calling software was used to analyze sequence trace files and generate raw sequences.15 Peaks with Phred quality values of <20 were taken as ambiguous sequences and were presented by a universal placeholder ‘N’. Vector sequences were filtered automatically. Then, all 5′-tagged sequences were selected by a Perl script for clustering, which used the TGICL program.16 These singletons and every representative clone from each contig were selected to be completely sequenced by bidirectional sequencing strategy. All processed sequences were assembled by Phrap software.Accession numbers for submitted data in the EMBL database CT841557–CT841684; CT841686–CT841707; CT841710–CT841954; CT841956–CT842008; CU405560–CU405627; CU405629–CU405654; CU405656–CU405706; CU405708–CU405710; CU405712–CU405714; CU405716–CU405717; CU405719–CU405720; CU405722–CU405729; CU405731–CU405880; CU405882–CU405928; CU405930–CU406064; CU406066–CU406249; CU406251–CU406335; CU406337–CU406954 and CU861673–CU861883.These W1943 sequences are available from our website (http://202.127.18.228/ricd/dym/ftp.php).2.3. Comparative analysis of FLcDNA sequencesSimilarity searches were performed with BLAST (version 2.2.14) program17 against sequence data as follows: NCBI GenBank nt DB (2007-12), nr DB (2007-12), est-other DB (2007-07), rice japonica genomic sequence (http://rgp.dna.affrc.go.jp/IRGSP/), the Institute for Genomic Research (TIGR) rice cDNA data (release 4.0), TIGR_Oryza_Repeats_v3.1, Knowledge-based Oryza Molecular Biological Encyclopedia japonica cDNA collection (http://cdna01.dna.affrc.go.jp/cDNA, 2006-10-11) and National Center for Gene Research (NCGR, http://www.ncgr.ac.cn/ricd) Rice Indica cDNA Database (RICD). We downloaded all above sequence data and used our 1888 clones as query sequences. The similarity threshold of E-value was lower than 1E−10. We searched InterPro database18 to compare the profiles of proteins encoded in W1943 FLcDNAs. Functional classification of cDNAs was referred to PFAM profiles.19A similarity-based tool sim420 was used to align W1943 FLcDNA sequence with rice genomic sequence. It was also used to identify and discard redundant gene sequences. Open reading frames (ORFs) of cDNA sequences were determined by using getorf program of EMBOSS package.21 The rice MPSS database13 was used for quantitative expression analysis of these W1943 cDNAs in rice. The expression levels were calculated for rice different tissues or same tissues at different developmental stages by summing all expressed tags in the sense strand. To calculate synonymous divergence (Ks), program ClustalX 1.822 and PAL2NAL (version: V11)23 were applied.Rfam database24 (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Rfam/) and miRBase25 (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/) data were downloaded for non-protein-coding transcripts analysis. Software mFOLD was applied to predict pre-miRNAs' secondary structure (http://mfold.bioinfo.rpi.e.du/).263. Results and Discussion3.1. Overall description of W1943 FLcDNA sequencesTwo full-length enriched cDNA libraries of O. rufipogon W1943 were constructed following the cap-tagging method.8 Each cDNA library was composed of 1 × 106 independent clones. The average cDNA sizes were 0.5–1.5 kb. In total, we randomly selected 8352 clones (6432 were from the normal rice leaf cDNA library and 1920 were from the cold-stressed rice leaf cDNA library) for 5′-end sequencing. In total, there were 4876 tagged potential FLcDNA clones of at least 100 continuous nucleotides with a Phred score of >20, after removal of vector sequences and low quality reads. The TGICL program16 was used to cluster these 4876 cDNA clones. Thus, there were 2350 cDNAs, consisting of 454 representative unique clone contigs and 1896 singletons, generated for completely sequencing and assembling. Overlapping 5′ and 3′ reads were assembled to consensus sequences through the bidirectional sequencing strategy.Up to now, we have successfully obtained 1888 non-redundant W1943 cDNA sequences. Of 1888 cDNA sequences, 1360 sequences matched to NCBI GenBank non-redundant database of proteins (nrDB) (E < 1e−10; >70% identity). Of 1360 sequences, 997 cDNAs could fully cover the protein N-terminal first amino acid sequence. Therefore, we estimated that >70% of the 1832 cDNA sequences were FLcDNAs. It should be pointed out that the efficiency of CIP and TAP treatments played a key role in constructing the FLcDNA library. On the other hand, it was also possible that some of the remaining 30% putative truncated cDNA sequences might be genuine FLcDNAs transcribed from alternative start sites. There are lots of alternative transcription start sites known in mammals.27,283.2. Mapping of the 1888 W1943 FLcDNAs onto cultivated rice O. sativa genomic sequencesThe 1888 FLcDNAs from O. rufipogon W1943 were mapped to O. sativa ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare genomic sequence pseudomolecules (version 4.0) and compared with GenBank nrDB based on BLASTn (E < 1e−10) and BLASTx (E < 1e−10), respectively.5 Of the 1888 FLcDNA sequences, 1831 (97.0%) could be aligned to the japonica genomic sequences at >80% sequence identity over the entire length (Fig. 1). The remaining 57 cDNAs that did not match the ssp. japonica genomic sequences are discussed in the following analysis. Among 1831 W1943 cDNAs, 395 (21.6%) fully matched the ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare genomic sequences with 100% identity at nucleotide level. However, among 1831 cDNAs, 487 fully matched to corresponding proteins in nrDB with 100% identity. Therefore, 35.8% of W1943 cDNAs had full identity to proteins from nrDB at amino acid level. In spite of relatively low full identity at nucleotide acid level (only 21.6%), it was more conservative at amino acid level (>35.8%) between wild and cultivated rice. It was propitious to protect some key proteins from losing their conserved and vital functions.Mapping of the 1888 FLcDNAs onto Oryza sativa genomic sequences.Mapping of the 1888 FLcDNAs onto Oryza sativa genomic sequences.We also mapped the 1888 W1943 FLcDNAs to the O. sativa ssp. indica cv. 93-11 whole-genome shotgun sequences using BLASTn (E < 1e−10). A total of 1837 (97.2%) W1943 cDNAs could be aligned to the cv. 93-11 genome sequences at >80% sequence identity over the entire length (Fig. 1). Of these, 126 (6.9%) identically matched the cv. 93-11 genome sequences. These results indicated that the sequence of wild rice W1943 had a very high similarity with those of cultivated ssp. japonica (97.0%) and ssp. indica (97.2%) rice; and W1943 had greater similarity to japonica than to indica at nucleotide acid level. Monna et al.29 surmised that W1943 was closer to japonica than to indica. It has been reported that japonica cultivars are closely related to the O. rufipogon perennial strains, and indica cultivars closely related to the O. rufipogon annual strains.30 Our results confirmed this conclusion at transcriptional level.In the case of 395 W1943 FLcDNAs that were 100% matched to the genomic sequences, we checked the splicing patterns by comparing with all rice ESTs or mRNAs in public databases. The results revealed that 15 W1943 cDNAs had alternative splicing patterns when compared with cultivated rice ESTs or mRNAs (Table 1). These alternative splicing patterns might be specific for W1943. Furthermore, the first introns of two genes (CT841942 and CU406810) had a distinct splice site with GC-AG and GT-TG. We concluded that cultivated rice had experienced some mutations including the intron region, and thus some genes were lost over the long evolutionary period. There were four typical alternative splicing patterns of these sequences (Fig. 2).Total 17 W1943 cDNAs had alternative splicing patterns different from previous ESTs or mRNAs in public database. It revealed four typical splicing patterns in wild rice species.Total 17 W1943 cDNAs had alternative splicing patterns different from previous ESTs or mRNAs in public database. It revealed four typical splicing patterns in wild rice species.List of 15 Oryza rufipogon W1943 genes with specific alternative splicing patternsList of 15 Oryza rufipogon W1943 genes with specific alternative splicing patternsIt should be pointed out that 10 of 1831 W1943 cDNAs had no hits to previously reported rice ESTs or mRNAs in GenBank database (Table 2). Another seven cDNAs had hits to rice ESTs or mRNAs at the sense–antisense pattern (Table 3). So these cDNA sequences offered novel rice transcripts to public database. As for the 17 W1943 cDNA sequences, they were either wild-rice-specific genes or cultivated rice co-owner genes. If the latter was the case, it may indicate that these genes are expressed at much lower levels in cultivated than in wild rice. Hence, it would be difficult to clone these cDNAs from cultivated rice in spite of a total of ∼47 000 ssp. japonica and ssp. indica cDNAs available in the current public database (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/). We used the rice MPSS database (http://mpss.udel.edu/rice/) to detect the expression level of these 17 putative novel W1943 cDNAs under different conditions.13 The results showed that 15 of 17 cDNAs were not detected having expressed tags with sense strand orientation in different tissues. Gene ‘CU861721’ was found only 18 times per million (tpm) in young leaves and gene ‘CU406355’ was found >100 tpm in young roots and germinating seedlings.List of 10 novel cDNA transcripts of Oryza rufipogon W1943List of 10 novel cDNA transcripts of Oryza rufipogon W1943List of seven sense–antisense cDNA transcripts of Oryza rufipogon W1943List of seven sense–antisense cDNA transcripts of Oryza rufipogon W1943In addition, 57 W1943 cDNAs that could not be aligned to the ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare genomic sequence were further analyzed. After comparing with other public databases, 14 of them matched the ssp. indica cv. 93-11 genomic sequences, 6 matched to rice ESTs in NCBI est-other database, 4 had similarity to Sorghum bicolor, Triticum aestivum, Manihot esculenta and Spartina alterniflora ESTs, 15 were homologs to Gibberella moniliformis, Gibberella zeae and Magnaporthe grisea, and the remaining 18 had no hits. Table 4 listed 24 W1943 cDNAs' information after excluding 15 possible contamination clones and 18 no any hits clones. Several W1943 cDNAs that did not match to the cv. Nipponbare genomic sequence might be located in the gap of genomic sequence or might be related to wild rice W1943-specific genes.List of 24 no-hit Oryza sativa ssp. japonica genome sequencesList of 24 no-hit Oryza sativa ssp. japonica genome sequences3.3. Comparative analysis with cultivated rice cDNA sequences in public databasesThe 1888 W1943 cDNAs were compared with cultivated rice cDNA sequences. The large-scale rice ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare cDNA sequences have been released to public databases.7 Recently, another batch of rice ssp. indica cv. Guangluai 4 cDNA sequences was released to public databases (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/; http://www.ncgr.ac.cn/RICD).8 We compared these two major cultivated rice varieties' cDNAs with 1888 W1943 cDNA sequences. For convenience, here we named cv. Nipponbare cDNA sequences as KOME (knowledge-based oryza molecular biological encyclopedia) and cv. Guangluai 4 cDNA sequences as NCGR (National Center for Gene Research, CAS). At present, there are 35 187 ssp. japonica FLcDNA sequences in KOME, and 10 096 ssp. indica FLcDNA sequences in NCGR.Initially, we identified chromosomal distributions of the three different rice cDNAs along the cv. Nipponbare chromosomal pseudomolecules (Fig. 3). Though there were relatively small quantities of W1943 cDNAs, there were similar trace trends and no visible large bias comparing KOME and NCGR cDNAs. So the 1888 W1943 cDNAs can give clues to the entire W1943 genome.Chromosomal distributions of the three different rice cDNAs (W1943, KOME, NCGR) along the ssp. japonica cv.

Though relative small quantities of W1943 cDNAs, it had about similar trace trends and no visible large bias comparing with KOME and NCGR (KOME, Oryza sativa ssp. japonica Nipponbare cDNAs; NCGR, Oryza sativa ssp. indica Guangluai 4 cDNAs.).Chromosomal distributions of the three different rice cDNAs (W1943, KOME, NCGR) along the ssp. japonica cv.

We described all SSR motifs of 1–6 nucleotides in size. The minimum repeat unit was prescribed as follows: 10 repeats for mononucleotides, 6 for di-nucleotides and 5 for all the other motifs such as tri-, tetra-, penta- and hexa-nucleotides. We detected the five highest frequencies of SSR motifs of the overall cDNA sequences, 5′-UTR sequences, ORF sequences and 3′-UTR sequences, respectively (Fig. 4). The highest frequencies of the SSR motifs in the three different rice cDNAs were identical in 5′-UTR, ORF or 3′-UTR regions. First, the motif CCG/CGG has the highest frequencies in 5′-UTR and ORF regions, but the SSR motif A/T has the highest frequency in 3′-UTR region. Second, all kinds of motif types were unevenly distributed in the FLcDNA sequences. The motifs CCG/CGG and A/T were more frequent in the ORF and 3′-UTR regions, respectively, with frequencies >50%. However, in 5′-UTR regions, the most frequent SSR motifs were ≤28%. In addition, scanning showed that the three most frequent SSR motif-types in ORF regions were all triplets that differed from those in UTR regions. This difference was very important for coding sequence because tri-nucleotide SSR motif-types could effectively prevent amino acid from frame shifting. Furthermore, the five most frequent SSR motifs were all triplets; the only exception was the fourth most frequent SSR type of NCGR, which was A/T (7.19%). In the process of evolution, relative higher frequency of mononucleotide SSR motifs of NCGR ORF was likely to be one key factor that led to divergence of ssp. indica and ssp. japonica. This could partly explain why W1943 was closer to japonica than to indica.The first five highest frequency SSR motifs in the overall cDNA sequences, 5′-UTR sequences, ORF sequences and 3′-UTR sequences, respectively.The first five highest frequency SSR motifs in the overall cDNA sequences, 5′-UTR sequences, ORF sequences and 3′-UTR sequences, respectively.We carried out transcripts comparisons between W1943 and the other two cultivated rice subspecies (Fig. 5). A total of 823 W1943 cDNAs were detected according to their homology with both KOME and NCGR (≥95% identity and non-redundant hit to KOME and NCGR). We extracted the ORF of each cDNA sequence using the getorf program.21 The amino acid levels in a total of 194 ORF groups were all identical (Fig. 5A), 143 ORF groups were specifically identical between W1943 and KOME, 87 ORF groups were specifically identical between W1943 and NCGR, and 64 ORF groups were specifically identical between KOME and NCGR. Consequently, 40.9% of transcripts were conserved in wild rice W1943 and cultivated rice ssp. japonica cv. Nipponbare; 34.1% were conserved in W1943 and cultivated rice ssp. indica cv. Guangluai 4 and 31.3% were conserved in cvs. Nipponbare and Guangluai 4.Comparative analysis with Oryza sativa cDNA sequences in public databases.

The results showed that 106 of 194 (54.6%) groups were also completely identical at nucleotide level. So the remaining 88 groups were used to calculate synonymous divergence (Ks) (Fig. 5B). Of 88 groups, 42 groups had no synonymous substitution between W1943 and KOME; 9 groups had no synonymous substitution between W1943 and NCGR; 15 groups had no synonymous substitution between KOME and NCGR and another 22 groups had synonymous substitutions among the three species and subspecies. That is, at nucleotide level, 76.2% of 194 identical ORF groups had no changes in W1943 and cv. Nipponbare, and 59.2% for W1943 and cv. Guangluai 4.It was reported29 that the rates of polymorphisms in predicted intergenic regions of rice were 0.302 (W1943/Nipponbare), 0.653 (W1943/Guangluai 4) and 0.630 (Nipponbare/Guangluai 4), respectively. These were similar to results in coding sequence regions in the present study. Thus, the hypothesis that O. rufipogon W1943 was closer to ssp. japonica than to ssp. indica was further validated.3.4. miRNAs identificationAfter searching against NCBI nrDB using BLASTx, 432 sequences of 1888 W1943 cDNAs found no hits in the database. Of 432 sequences, 71 were predicted as ORFs > 100 amino acid in length, so the remaining 361 were assumed to be putative non-protein-coding transcripts. Searching against Rfam database and miRBase, four cDNAs matched to four miRNA families; the osa-MIR159a, osa-MIR156j, osa-MIR818e and osa-miR446 families, respectively (Table 5). Using the mFOLD program, all four sequences could be predicted to pre-miRNA secondary structure and identified as miRNAs according to folding results.List of 4 miRNAsList of 4 miRNAs3.5. Expression analysis by searching against the rice MPSS databaseWe used the rice MPSS database (http://mpss.udel.edu/rice/) to detect the expression level of W1943 cDNAs under different conditions.13 To define tissue-specific genes, we demarcated the qualifications as follows: (i) the expression level of every gene should >100 tpm of at least one tissue; (ii) if the gene expressed in several diverse tissues, then the highest expression level should be >75% among all tissues and (iii) the ratio of the first two highest expression levels should be >10. Thus, we identified 41 putative tissue-specific genes (Table 6). There were 16 W1943 cDNAs expressed remarkably highly in leaves, 11 cDNAs specifically in roots, 1 in germinating seed, 3 in callus, 7 in germinating seedlings, 1 in meristematic tissue and 2 in mature pollen. Searching against the PFAM protein database, we found that gene ‘CU406902’ was predicted as ‘Lir1, light regulated protein Lir1’. Lir1 mRNA can accumulate in the light, reaching maximum and minimum steady-state levels at the end of the light and dark periods.31 Another gene ‘CT841733’ was predicted as ‘RuBisCO_small’ (ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase small subunit). Although the RuBisCO large subunit is coded for by a single gene, the small subunit is coded for by several different genes, which are distributed in a tissue-specific manner. They are transcriptionally regulated by light receptor phytochrome, which results in RuBisCO being more abundant during the day when it is required.32List of Oryza rufipogon W1943 tissue-specific genes (unit: tpm)NGS, 3 days—Germinating seed; NCA, 35 days—Callus; NGD, 10 days—Germinating seedlings grown in dark; NME, 60 days—Crown vegetative meristematic tissue; NPO, mature pollen.List of Oryza rufipogon W1943 tissue-specific genes (unit: tpm)NGS, 3 days—Germinating seed; NCA, 35 days—Callus; NGD, 10 days—Germinating seedlings grown in dark; NME, 60 days—Crown vegetative meristematic tissue; NPO, mature pollen.In the similar restricted conditions as above, there were seven W1943 cDNAs with distinct expression level in leaves exposed to cold, drought or salinity stresses (Table 7). Of the seven cDNAs, four genes were up-regulated by cold stress, two genes were up-regulated by drought and one gene was up-regulated by salinity. It should be pointed out that gene ‘CU405946’ matched to PFAM protein annotated as ‘Dehydrin’. This protein is produced by plants that experience water-stress.33List of seven cDNAs preferentially expressed under cold-stress, drought-stress and salinity in leaf (unit: tpm)NCL, 14 days—Young leaves stressed in 4°C cold for 24 h; NDL, 14 days—Young leaves stressed in drought for 5 days; NSL, 14 days—Young leaves stressed in 250 mM NaCl for 24 h.List of seven cDNAs preferentially expressed under cold-stress, drought-stress and salinity in leaf (unit: tpm)NCL, 14 days—Young leaves stressed in 4°C cold for 24 h; NDL, 14 days—Young leaves stressed in drought for 5 days; NSL, 14 days—Young leaves stressed in 250 mM NaCl for 24 h.3.6. ConclusionsIn this research, we collected and completely sequenced 1888 putative FLcDNAs of wild rice O. rufipogon Griff. W1943. A total of 17 novel rice cDNAs and 41 putative tissue-specific expression genes were identified. The comparative analysis between wild rice and two cultivated rice subspecies indicated that O. rufipogon W1943 had greater similarity to O. sativa ssp. japonica than to ssp. indica cultivars. It is reported that W1943 is primarily distributed in Dongxiang (26°14'N, 116°36'E) of Jiangxi Province in China.34 It is found to be the northern most distribution of O. rufipogon at present time.35 Both cultivated rice O. sativa ssp. japonica and indica have distributions in this area. The geological distribution of W1943 can also provide some clues for further analysis between wild and cultivated rices.FundingThis research was supported by the grants from the Ministry of Science and Technology of China (the China Rice Functional Genomics Programs, 2005CB120805 and 2006AA10A102), the Chinese Academy of Sciences (038019315 and KSCX2-YW-N-024) and the Shanghai Municipal Commission of Science and Technology.We thank the Plant Genome Center (Tsukuba, Japan) for kindly providing seeds of W1943."

IntroductionNitrogen-fixing rhizobia are of great agronomic benefit, allowing many leguminous crops to be grown without nitrogen fertilizer by forming endosymbiotic relationships with the plants. In the course of the symbiosis, rhizobia elicit formation of specialized organs, ‘root nodules’, on the roots of compatible host legumes. Inside the nodules, the bacteria convert inert atmospheric dinitrogen into biologically usable ammonia. Since this symbiotic relationship is established by the results of highly regulated molecular dialogues between host plant and rhizobia, the system of symbiotic nitrogen fixation is therefore a very suitable model for studies of plant–microbe interactions.The agronomic and biological importance of the rhizobia has accelerated the determination of the full genome sequences of several rhizobial species.1–6 The availability of complete genome sequences has drastically changed the strategy for studying rhizobial genetics. Gene identification and functional assignment have been accelerated by utilizing the genome sequences. Simultaneously with the completions of rhizobial genome sequences, post-genomic researches on several rhizobia have rapidly progressed. Comprehenzsive transcriptome or proteome analyses have been conducted to examine physiological states of rhizobia under a variety of conditions, including symbiosis with the host legume or nutrient-depleted conditions.7–12 In addition, we previously conducted a large-scale interactome analysis in order to propose functional relationships between known and unknown rhizobial genes.13 These advances in rhizobial genetics have generated a vast amount of information about gene function and regulation; however, the advances have simultaneously raised the need for development of novel molecular tools which make use of the results of these functional analyses.One of the most utilized genetic approaches to reveal gene function is the disruption of particular genes and subsequent phenotypic characterization of the mutants. Comprehensive collections of single gene disruptants have been systematically constructed in several model organisms by transposon random mutagenesis or targeted gene disruption approaches.14–18 These analyses have contributed to the discovery of essential genes of the organisms and have provided fundamental tools for functional studies of many known and unknown genes. In rhizobia, recent genome-wide analyses have provided various intriguing and useful starting points for more detailed functional studies;7–13 however, there are still large gaps between such systematic analyses and the availability of the corresponding gene mutants. Such gaps have resulted primarily because targeted gene disruption achieved by homologous recombination is not suitable for systematic generation of mutants in rhizobia because of its low efficiency. In addition, screening of mutants in some test conditions is problematic because phenotypes of individual mutants have to be evaluated one-by-one. Therefore, more effective approaches to generate large mutant collections and allow simultaneous screening of many mutants are needed.In this study, we conducted the first large-scale random mutagenesis of Mesorhizobium loti, an endosymbiont of the model legume Lotus japonicus, using a signature-tagged mutagenesis (STM) technique. STM is based on transposon insertional mutagenesis that allows large numbers of mutants to be analyzed simultaneously. This is accomplished by tagging each mutant with a unique short DNA sequence so that it can subsequently be distinguished from other mutants by detecting unique signature tags. This system has been used with a variety of bacteria, and, in particular, has been applied to discovery of virulence genes in several microbial pathogens.19 Recently, a large STM library was constructed in Sinorhizobium meliloti strain 1021,20 a symbiont of Medicago truncatula and contributed to the discovery of many genes relevant to symbiosis and competitiveness.21 However, genome-wide generation of disruption mutants in M. loti, in addition to the set of S. meliloti, is also very valuable for several reasons. First, M. loti and S. meliloti exhibit different aspects as symbiont for legumes. They naturally exhibit distinct host-specificity and form different types of nodules (determinate and indeterminate nodules) on their respective model legume hosts, L. japonicus and M. truncatula. With respect to this symbiosis, previous studies have discovered several rhizobial factors and metabolic cycles required for nodulation and nitrogen-fixation.22–24 However, comparative verifications of the significance of these factors on respective symbioses have not been fully explored. Second, comparative genomics analyses have revealed the existence of genes that are conserved, as well as many that are specific to each species,2,25 but the molecular tools available for the functional comparisons of these genes are extremely limited. Therefore, large collections of disruption mutants on the individual species are necessary to reveal common and unique biological aspects of the two species.In this report, we developed a large signature-tagged mutant library of M. loti in order to provide fundamental tools for functional studies of M. loti genes and characterized it with the gene coverage and transposon insertion distribution of the library. Sequencing of transposon insertion sites enabled us to collect defined sets of transposon mutants. Furthermore, pilot experiments showed the utility of the mutants and provide basic experimental conditions that can be used for future mutant screenings. This large signature-tagged mutant library will be an important and powerful resource for future functional genomics in M. loti.2. Materials and methods2.1. Bacterial strains and growth conditionsEscherichia coli strains DH5α and MT616 were used as hosts for the transposon plasmids and pRK600 helper plasmid,26 respectively. Transposon insertion mutants were generated in the wild-type M. loti strain MAFF303099. Mesorhizobium loti was grown at 30°C in tryptone yeast (TY) extract medium27 supplemented with phosphomycin (100 µg/ml). Escherichia coli was grown at 37°C in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. LB medium was supplemented with streptomycin (100 µg/ml) and spectinomycin (100 µg/ml) for DH5α donor cells harboring transposon plasmids and with chloramphenicol (20 µg/ml) for MT616 helper cells. Transposon insertion mutants were selected on TY medium supplemented with streptomycin, spectinomycin and phosphomycin at the same concentration as above.2.2. Construction of signature-tagged transposon plasmidsThe backbone of the transposon plasmid was pTnMod-OGm.28 The Ω interposon cassette was excised from pHP45Ω29 and inserted by replacing a SacI fragment containing the gentamicin resistance gene cassette of pTnMod-OGm. The resultant construct was designated pTnMod-OΩ. Twenty-seven different 21-base oligonucleotides (Supplementary Table S1) were annealed to complementary molecules to make double-strand tags. Each oligonucleotide tag was inserted individually into the blunted KpnI site of pTnMod-OΩ (Fig. 1). These 27 signature-tagged constructs were designated pTnMod-OΩ-tag1 to pTnMod-OΩ-tag41.Vector construct used for STM of M. loti. The tagged transposon plasmids were constructed from the backbone of pTnMod-OGm.28 The omega-interposon cassette (Spr/Smr) was excised from pHP45Ω29 and inserted into the SacI site of pTnMod-OGm. Oligonucleotide tags (21 bp) were incorporated into the KpnI site. Arrows indicate the locations of the STM common primer and the tag-specific primer (Supplementary Table S1). OriT is an RP4 origin of transfer. IR and tnp represent the inverted repeat and Tn5 transposase, respectively.Vector construct used for STM of M. loti.

Transposon mutagenesisIntroduction of tagged transposon plasmids into M. loti was carried out by tri-parental mating.30Escherichia coli strains DH5α and MT616 (containing the pRK600 helper plasmid) were used as the conjugation donor and helper, respectively. An overnight culture of donor and helper (0.5 ml each) was mixed with 1 ml of a 2-day culture of M. loti. After washing several times with sterilized water, the cell mixture was suspended in 50 µl of sterilized water and spotted onto a sterilized membrane filter (MILLIPORE, Billerica, MA, USA, pore size 0.45 µm, Cat. No. HAWG047S3) that was placed on TY agar medium without antibiotics. After an 8 h incubation on the membrane filter at 30°C, all the cells were collected and suspended in 1 ml of sterilized water. Suspended cells were plated on TY selection medium supplemented with phosphomycin, spectinomycin and streptomycin, and grown further until positive colonies appeared. Finally, individual positive colonies were picked up randomly in 96-well plates and stored at −80°C.2.4. Determination of transposon insertion sitesTransposon insertion sites were determined by direct sequencing of transposon-genome flanking region. Cell culture and genomic DNA isolation were carried out in 96-well plate format. Five microlitter of stocked mutant clones were inoculated into 1 ml of TY medium containing phosphomycin (100 µg/ml), streptomycin (100 µg/ml) and spectinomycin (100 µg/ml), and the cultures were grown in 96-well deep-well plate (Axygen Bioscience, Union City, CA, USA) at 30°C for 2 days. After centrifugation of cultured cells at 4000 rpm for 15 min, genomic DNA of mutants was prepared using AquaPure Genomic DNA isolation kit (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Tokyo, Japan). Collected cells in each well were suspended in 150 µl of Genomic DNA Lysis Solution and were incubated at 80°C for 15 min. RNaseA solution (0.75 µl) was added to cell lysate, and the mixture was incubated at 37°C for 60 min. After the incubation on ice for 15 min, 50 µl of protein precipitation solution was added to each well and the samples were mixed well by vortex. Samples were then transferred individually to 1.5 ml microcentrifuge tube and were centrifuged at 15 000 rpm for 15 min. Supernatants (100–125 µl) were transferred to new 96-well PCR plate containing 100 µl of isopropanol and were mixed well by inverting plate. Genomic DNA precipitated by centrifugation (4000 rpm, 30 min) was rinsed three times with 200 µl of 70% ethanol. Genomic DNA was then dried and dissolved in 20 µl of DNA hydration solution. After heating the samples at 65°C for 60 min, concentration of genomic DNA was measured and ∼2 µg of genomic DNA was used for direct sequence. Direct sequencing was performed with the STM-seq primer (5′-TTTGCTGGCCTTTTGCTCACATGTTCTTTC-3′) using the following PCR conditions: 98°C for 3 min, followed by 70 cycles of 97°C for 15 s and 60°C for 4 min. The composition of reaction mixture for direct sequence was as follows. Two micrograms of genomic DNA, 1 µl of STM-seq primer (3.2 µM), 1 µl of BigDye Terminator premix (Applied Biosystem, Foster City, CA, USA), 3.5 µl of 5× sequencing buffer (Applied Biosystems) and sterilized water were added up to 20 µl.For some clones which were not successfully identified by direct sequencing, we determined the transposon integration sites by two-round inverse PCR. For inverse PCR, genomic DNA (∼1 µg) isolated from each mutant was digested with SalI and XhoI, and then self-ligated using a DNA ligation kit (TAKARA Bio, Shiga, Japan). Using a self-ligated DNA template and a primer pair (5′-TTCGCCACCTCTGACTTGAGCGTCG-3′ and 5′-GAATTGATCCGGTGGATGAC-3′), first round PCR was performed using the following cycling conditions: 98°C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 97°C for 15 s, 55°C for 45 s, 72°C for 3 min and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. A 1 µl aliquot from the first round PCR product was added to a secondary PCR reaction mixture containing a nested primer pair (5′-TTTGCTGGCCTTTTGCTCACATGTTCTTTC-3′ and 5′-ACGGTTTACAAGCATAAAGC-3′). Second round PCR was performed using the following PCR conditions: 98°C for 2 min, followed by 35 cycles of 97°C for 15 s, 57°C for 45 s, 72°C for 3 min and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. After the secondary PCR, products were purified by polyethylene glycol precipitation and suspended in 10 µl distilled water. The composition of sequence reaction mixture with amplified PCR product was as follows. Two microliters of PCR product, 1 µl of sequencing primer (5′-ACGGTTTACAAGCATAAAGC-3′) (3.2 µM), 1 µl of BigDye Terminator premix (Applied Biosystems), 3.5 µl of 5× sequencing buffer (Applied Biosystems) and 12.5 µl of sterilized water. Cycle sequencing was performed at 96°C for 1 min and then at 96°C for 10 s, 50°C for 5 s and 60°C for 4 min for 25 cycles. All sequencings were analyzed by ABI 3730 autosequencer. The resulting sequences were subsequently subjected to BlastN search against the M. loti genome sequence (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/rhizobase/Mesorhizobium/index.html) to determine the transposon insertion sites.2.5. PCR and real-time PCRThe specificity of oligonucleotide tags was examined by PCR. Tag-containing DNA fragments (160 bp) were amplified from genomic DNA using the Herculase II Fusion DNA Polymerase (STRATAGENE, La Jolla, CA, USA), and forward (Supplementary Table S1) and reverse (STM-common, 5′-TTCGCCACCTCTGACTTGAGCGTCG-3′) primers were used for amplification. PCR reactions were conducted in GeneAmp PCR system 9700 (Applied Biosystems) using the following conditions: initial denaturation at 98°C for 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of 97°C for 15 s, 68°C for 1 min and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Amplified products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels.The population of growth-deficient mutant within a mutant pool was examined by real-time PCR. Genomic DNA isolated from input and output pools was used as the DNA template. Real-time PCR was performed using a DyNAmo HS SYBR Green qPCR kit (Finnzyme, Espoo, Finland) and reactions were detected by a DNA Engine Opticon system (Bio-Rad). The conditions used for real-time PCR are as follows: 15 min at 95°C, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s and 72°C for 30 s and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Quantitative and specificity (melting curve) analyses of amplified PCR products were carried out using associated software in the Opticon system (Opticon monitor3) by following the manufacture's protocol.2.6. Detection of signature tags from plant samplesSeeds of L. japonicus (MG-20 Miyakojima) were sterilized and germinated on half-strength B&D agar medium. Six-day-old seedlings were transferred to B&D agar medium or inoculation pots filled with vermiculite and were then inoculated with 1 × 107 cell/ml of mutant mixture.For tag detection from nodules, detached nodules were washed twice with a solution of 0.5%-SDS-100 mM NaCl and then soaked in 70% ethanol for 5 min. After five times washes with sterilized water, total DNA was isolated using a DNeasy plant mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). For amplification of a tag-containing fragment from a single nodule, nodule was washed as above and crushed in 700 µl sterilized water. After boiling the samples at 95°C for 5 min, 5 µl of supernatant was used for PCR. PCR reactions with nodule samples used the following conditions: initial denaturation at 98°Cfor 2 min, followed by 25 cycles of 97°C for 15 s, 68°C for 1 min and a final extension at 72°C for 10 min. Amplified products were analyzed on 2% agarose gels.3. Results and discussion3.1. Construction of a signature-tagged mutant libraryIn this study, we adapted transposon-based STM techniques to genome-wide mutagenesis of the symbiotic bacterium, M. loti. As a transposon construct, the plasposon plasmid pTnMod-OGm which carries a Tn5-based mini-transposon and conditional origin of replication28 was used for mutagenesis (Fig. 1). In order to screen for genes which were inactivated by transposon insertion and those affected polarity effect of the inserted transposon, we introduced the Ω interposon cassette by replacing the gentamycin resistance gene (aacC1) of pTnMod-OGm (Fig. 1). Since pTnMod is a broad host range suicide vector and the insertion of the Ω fragment confers spectinomycin and streptomycin resistance, only mutants in which the transposon fragment is integrated into the M. loti genome can be selected effectively by their antibiotic resistance.In order to distinguish individual transposon mutants, we introduced 21 bp short oligonucleotide tags that have been used in a previous study.31 Since these oligonucleotide tags were designed to have similar G+C content and melting temperature, they are feasible for PCR-based mutant screening. Considering the isolation of symbiotic mutants from root nodules in which reduction of variation was expected, number of tag variation need to be restricted to obtain reliable results of screening from a reasonable number of plant materials (root nodules). Therefore, we further selected tags from the original 41 tags31 by analyzing their specificity of PCR amplification. We selected a total of 29 unique tags based on the reproducibility of PCR amplification and the plasposon plasmids tagged with each of 29 tags (pTnMod-OΩ-tagn) were then individually mobilized into wild-type M. loti by tri-parental mating. Among the 29 tags, two tag plasmids which yielded significantly small numbers of transposon mutant colonies were eliminated, and the remaining 27 tags (Supplementary Table S1) were used for further analysis (name of tags are designated according to Hunt et al.31). In order to construct independent mutant libraries, tri-parental mating and collection of transposon mutants were carried out separately for each oligonucleotide tag. As the result of 63 independent tri-parental mating experiments, 29 330 independent transposon mutants were obtained (Table 1). Individual mutants were stored in 96-well plates and mutant names (ID) were assigned according to their position in the plate with prefix indicating tag number followed by ‘T’ (i.e. 07T02d09 is a mutant integrated with tag7 plasmid).Summary of experimental resultsSummary of experimental resultsThe coverage of the collected mutants is approximately fourfold with respect to the 7281 ORFs of M. loti.1 If the transposon insertions are evenly distributed throughout the M. loti genome, the mean distance between independent insertions is estimated to be 259 bp, and thus 91% of M. loti genes are expected to carry at least one insertion since M. loti genes shorter than 259 bp account for 9% of all genes.3.2. Utility of STM mutantsThe STM technique allows for the simultaneous screening of multiple mutants in mixed populations by detecting unique DNA tags. However, previous studies have reported that non-specific amplification or failure in tag amplification from mutant chromosomal DNA is a major inherent problem that affects the efficiency and reproducibility of the screening procedure.31,32 Therefore, the specificity and efficiency of tag amplification after integration into the genome needs to be tested in the respective targeted organisms. To investigate the possibility of cross-detection among the 27 signature tags used in this study, we conducted test amplifications by PCR. Fig. 2A shows representative results in which PCR was performed with genomic DNA from three individual tagged mutants (Tag2, Tag9 and Tag11). When a tag-specific primer (Supplementary Table S1) and the STM common primer (5′-TTCGCCACCTCTGACTTGAGCGTCG-3′) that anneals 120 bp downstream of the integrated oligonucleotide tag were used for PCR, specific amplification was observed only in reactions containing the appropriate tag-specific primer. A series of PCR reactions performed on the other oligonucleotide tags produced the same results as Fig. 2A, indicating that there are no cross-amplifications among the designed oligonucleotide tags. In addition, all 27 oligonucleotide tags were amplified specifically when genomic DNA from a mixture of mutants was used as the template (Fig. 2B). These test amplifications demonstrated that the applied oligonucleotide tags can be recovered specifically from the M. loti genome and that the 27 individually tagged mutants can be distinguished from one another by detecting these signature tags.Representative gels of control experiments testing the specificity of signature oligonucleotide tags. PCR was performed with genomic DNA isolated from mutants with pTnMod-OΩ-Tag2 (upper), pTnMod-OΩ-Tag9 (middle) or pTnMod-OΩ-Tag11 (bottom) alone (A), and using genomic DNA isolated from cultures containing a mixture of 27 mutants (B). The STM-common primer was used with one of the 27 different tag-specific primers (Supplementary Table S1) in each reaction. The numbers indicate the combination of primers.Representative gels of control experiments testing the specificity of signature oligonucleotide tags.

The STM-common primer was used with one of the 27 different tag-specific primers (Supplementary Table S1) in each reaction. The numbers indicate the combination of primers.In order to test the utility of our mutant sets, we carried out additional pilot experiments using both in vitro and in vivo conditions. In vitro experiments were conducted with a pool of mutants that contains a mutant with an attenuated growth on rich medium. To make a mutant set for the test experiment, one mutant was selected randomly from each 27-tag library and cultured individually. One growth-deficient clone (07T02d09) was included in the pool (Fig. 3A). Independently cultured clones were then mixed at same concentration to make an input pool. As for an output pool, the input pool was diluted 500-fold and cultured further for 2 days. After isolation of genomic DNA from both pools, the tag population was examined by real-time PCR. Real-time PCR was performed using the SYBR Green detection system with the same primer set used to test the cross-reactivity (Fig. 2). Fig. 3 illustrates the results of real-time PCR of the input (Fig. 3B) and output (Fig. 3C) pool samples. Consistent with the growth on agar medium (Fig. 3A), the quantity of PCR product derived from the growth-deficient mutant (07T02d09) was significantly lower than the other tags which were all amplified to similar levels (Fig. 3B and C). In addition, after each round of PCR amplification, a melting curve was generated for each run of 27 samples (Fig. 3D). The melting curve of all reactions exhibited a sharp peak at ∼83.5°C and a low melting peak was observed in the reactions with the tag7 primer (Fig 3D arrow), indicating that all tag-containing fragments were amplified specifically and that the quantity of tag7-containing fragment was lower than the other tags. This test experiment demonstrated that we can distinguish differences in populations of each tagged mutant within pools by quantifying the signature tags.Test experiments for identifying a growth-deficient mutant within a pool of mutants.

For these test experiments, one mutant from each of the 27 tag libraries was mixed in roughly equal quantities and inoculated onto L. japonicus roots to form nodules. Four weeks after inoculation, the nodules were detached and used for mutant detection. In order to determine how many mutants exist in a single nodule, we examined 22 nodules formed by the inoculation of two different pools of mutants. This confirmation enables us to estimate how many nodules should be analyzed for mutant screenings. When the presence of mutants in a single nodule was examined by the procedures described in the Materials and methods section, most nodules (18 of 22 tested nodules) were occupied by a mutant with a single tag (Supplementary Fig. S1). This result was consistent with a previous study in S. meliloti,21 indicating that the colonization or infection process may have similar features for both determinate and indeterminate nodules, and competition of infection may already occur at the colonization stage on host root hairs. And, as far as we tested, all tags were recovered in a screen of 70 nodules, suggesting that at least 70 nodules should be analyzed for mutant screenings in nodules.Additionally, we tested whether nodulation mutants can be screened properly for in nodules formed by pools of mutants. Two mutants (02T05e06 and 22T04b06) that exhibit defective in nodulation (Fig. 4A) were included in two distinct test sets (input samples) and inoculated onto L. japonicus roots. When we examined the presence of mutants in the total DNA isolated from 120 nodules (output samples), tag2 and tag22 containing fragments were not recovered, whereas all the other tags were detected (Fig. 4B). These results are consistent with the defective nodulation phenotype of the mutants (02T05e06 and 22T04b06), as tested individually (Fig. 4A). During the infection process, integrated transposon elements were stable since identical amplification patterns were obtained before and after infection (Fig. 4C, three representative results are shown).Pilot experiments identifying mutants with a nodulation defective phenotype.

Mapping of transposon insertion sitesAlong with the collection of transposon mutants, we determined the transposon insertion sites of individual mutants. Transposon insertion sites were determined by sequencing of transposon-flanking genomic regions, followed by comparison with the reference genome sequence. Determination of transposon insertions revealed that the inverted repeat of both the left and right ends of the integrated transposon were followed by the individual 9 bp direct repeat of the target site, indicating that the transposition were occurred properly by Tn5-transposon integration.33The distribution of transposon insertion sites in the M. loti genome is illustrated in Fig. 5. Among 9344 mutants examined, insertion sites of 7892 were determined (success rate, 84.5%) that were mapped to 7586 unique insertion sites (Table 1). This proportion indicates that ∼96% of mutants carry a unique transposon insertion in their genome and there is no significant redundancy of a clone arising from identical parent clones in the same tri-parental mating experiment. Among the unique insertions, 7018 (92.5%), 398 (5.2%) and 170 (2.3%) were mapped onto the chromosome and two plasmids of M. loti (pMLa and pMLb), respectively (all insertion sites are listed in Supplementary Table S2 and S3). The proportion of transposon distribution was consistent with the proportion of total size of each M. loti replicon (Chr, 92.6%, pMLa 4.6% and pMLb 2.7%). Furthermore, among the unique insertion sites, 6430 (84.8%) were within ORFs, corresponding to the overall proportion (85.6%) of coding sequences within the entire M. loti genome.1Distribution of transposon insertions in the M. loti genome. The bars in the first and second circles show the position of transposon insertion sites within ORFs (red bars) and within intergenic regions (blue bars), respectively. The innermost circles represent the average G+C content calculated in each 10 kb. A positive deviation in G+C content from the average (62.7%) is shown by black bars pointing outward and a negative deviation by red bars pointing inward.

A positive deviation in G+C content from the average (62.7%) is shown by black bars pointing outward and a negative deviation by red bars pointing inward. Grey bar in chromosome indicates the region of symbiosis island.Previous studies have demonstrated that the distribution patterns of transposon insertion into genomes vary depending on the types of transposon and organisms used for mutagenesis.34–36 To examine whether the transposon insertions were distributed randomly throughout the M. loti genome, we first investigated potential target site preferences for transposon insertion. Transposon insertions occurred in both intragenic and intergenic regions and the orientations of integrated transposons, with respect to the ORF directions of transcription, are present in nearly equal proportions (3274 clones in the same direction as transcription and 3397 clones in the opposite direction) (Supplementary Table S2). In addition, according to a previous report,37 G+C content was calculated from the 9 nucleotides of the insertion-target sites and 10 nucleotides up- and down-stream of target site of 50 randomly selected clones. It showed a high variance ranging from 30% to 88% (Supplementary Table S4), and the average G+C content of the target site (62.7%) was consistent with that of M. loti chromosome (62.7%).1 Furthermore, 50 randomly selected target sites showed no obvious sequence pattern, including palindromic or symmetrical sequences, when these were analyzed by TEIRESIAS, the sequence pattern search algorithm (http://cbcsrv.watson.ibm.com/Tspd.html).38 These features indicate that there are no clear preferences in insertion with regard to G+C content or structural features of the target sites.In order to verify the random distribution of transposon insertion, we additionally investigated the relationship between the number of genes carrying an inserted transposon and the size of the corresponding genes. Fig. 6 shows the distribution of transposon insertion within ORFs. As expected, more transposon insertions occurred in larger ORFs and the number of disrupted genes clearly correlate with the number of M. loti ORFs in each size range. In addition, as shown in Fig. 5, there is no obvious correlation between the distribution of transposon insertion and local G+C content of the M. loti genome. The symbiosis island, which exhibits features of horizontally transferred genomic element of low G+C content, also contained transposon insertions at rates similar to other chromosomal region (Fig. 5 grey line). Furthermore, this random distribution was observed for all tagged plasmid constructs.Distribution of transposon insertion within M. loti ORFs. The white bars represent the number of M. loti genes in each size range and the grey bars represent the number of genes with transposon insertions. The line chart represents the average number of insertion in genes of each size range with standard deviation.

The white bars represent the number of M. loti genes in each size range and the grey bars represent the number of genes with transposon insertions. The line chart represents the average number of insertion in genes of each size range with standard deviation. Percentages in each bar indicate the coverage of disrupted genes in each size range.Several previous studies have provided sets of essential genes of organisms predicted from comprehensive random mutagenesis or targeted gene disruption.36,39,40 Although here we collected a large number of transposon mutants of M. loti, it is currently impossible to estimate the precise number of M. loti essential genes because the number of mutants for which transposon insertion sites have been determined is not sufficient to cover all non-essential genes. However, we can predict essential gene candidates among the relatively large size M. loti genes since large size M. loti genes (>3000 bp) were disrupted at high coverage (83.1%). Among 77 genes whose size is larger than 3000 bp, transposon insertions were not detected in 13 genes, whereas an average of 4.7 insertions occurred in other genes in this size range (Supplementary Table S5). Considering the random distribution of transposon insertion, these 13 genes are candidate M. loti essential genes required for growth on rich media. Among the genes, 11 genes (excluding mlr9704 and mll1090) are highly conserved in the genome of completely sequenced rhizobia and four genes, mlr8250 (isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase), mll0870 (DNA polymerase III alpha subunit), mlr0276 (RNA polymerase beta subunit) and mlr0277 (RNA polymerase, beta prime subunit), showed high similarity to essential genes of E. coli (ileS, dnaE, rpoB and rpoC, respectively). Furthermore, mlr2517 is orthologous to the essential gene of Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1 (carB, carbamoyl-phosphate synthase, large subunit).41 Other essential gene candidates could be those with insertions only near 3′-terminus of the ORF. Mutants for mll1426, mlr0796 and mlr0585 could be the candidate of essential genes since relatively small number of insertions, all of which were in their 3′-terminus, were detected as listed in Supplementary Table S5.In bacteria, essential genes are more evolutionarily conserved than non-essential genes.42 We compared E. coli essential genes and M. loti genes [BlastP search was carried out against E. coli essential genes listed in the PEC data base (www.shigen.nig.ac.jp/ecoli/pec/index.jsp)] and revealed that a total of 196 M. loti ORFs showed high similarity to E. coli essential genes. Transposon mutants were obtained for only 21 of these 196 genes (10.7%). This ratio is significantly low since the result of sequence analysis transposon insertion sites identified mutants for ∼50% of M. loti genes. Among the 21 genes with transposon insertion, eight genes have putative palarogous genes which are considered to complement the function of the disrupted genes. These results indicate that significant overlap exists among sets of essential genes in E. coli and M. loti. However, saturating collections of transposon mutants under different selective conditions are, of course, needed to confirm these genes cannot actually be disrupted.3.4. Mutant databaseTo provide resources for depositing and retrieving information on M. loti mutants, we developed a relational database, RhizoGenes (http://www.kazusa.or.jp/rhizobase/Mesorhizobium/genes2/index.html). This database operates as a public web database that provides general information about mutants, e.g. mutant IDs, transposon insertion site, list of mutant alleles and experimental results (which can be deposited by users). In this database, individual mutants can be retrieved through keyword search by clone ID, name and functional annotation of disrupted genes. Therefore, when genes have attracted interest on the basis of bioinformatic or functional genomic analyses, appropriate mutants can be searched immediately. The transposon mutants collected in this study will be available from the National Bioresource project of Japan (http://www.legumebase.agr.miyazaki-u.ac.jp/index.jsp).Furthermore, we have integrated this database into the genome information database, RhizoBase (http://bacteria.kazusa.or.jp/rhizobase/Mesorhizobium/index.html), so as to link directly to more detailed information about M. loti ORFs, such as operon structure, predicted protein domains and orthologous (paralogous) protein groups.3.5. Concluding remarksIn the present study, we have described a large-scale transposon mutagenesis in the nitrogen-fixing symbiotic bacterium, M. loti. The STM technique was adapted to barcode individual transposon mutants and a large mutant library containing >29 000 independent clones was created using a set of 27 signature tags. Sequencing of the transposon insertion sites of one-third of the mutants revealed a random distribution of transposon insertion and ∼50% of M. loti genes have been confirmed to be disrupted. Since such a large number of disruption mutants have not previously been available for M. loti and the low efficiency of gene-disruption mediated by homologous recombination has been a serious technical bottleneck for functional studies of this symbiont, our mutant collections should be a powerful tool for future functional studies of M. loti genes.Applied STM technique and PCR-based screening allow for the simultaneous discovery of mutants with subtle phenotypic differences, such as reduced competitiveness or survival under various conditions. Additionally, random distribution of transposon insertion ensures the screenings of mutants over the entire M. loti genome and reduces the number of clones to be screened. Determination of transposon insertion sites also enables users to select defined, non-redundant sets of mutants depending on individual needs and facilitates rapid identification of causal genes of the mutant phenotypes. Furthermore, individual transposon mutants can be used as single gene disruptants. The availability of single gene disruptants allows functional verifications of individual or paralogous M. loti genes as well as comparative functional studies by examining with the orthologous genes of other rhizobium species. Additionally, our resource will be useful for in planta studies in the host legume. Actually, our STM mutants have recently contributed to reveal the importance of purine metabolisms in Lotus-M. loti symbiosis.24 Use of the mutant collections in Lotus-M. loti symbiosis will contribute to discovery of novel rhizobial factors or host plant recognition systems required for the symbiosis. By providing this mutant resource to the research communities, we hope to contribute to various functional analyses that lead to novel findings and understandings of rhizobial biology.Supplementary dataSupplementary data are available at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by KAKENHI (Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research) on Priority Areas “Comparative Genomics” from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan, and the Kazusa DNA Research Institute Foundation.Supplementary data"

IntroductionPre-mRNAs from land plant organelles frequently undergo single nucleotide conversions of cytidine residues to uridine.1 This process, called RNA editing, was first discovered in wheat mitochondrion mRNA encoding coxII2 and maize chloroplast mRNA encoding rpl2.3 Many reports of RNA editing sites followed these discoveries.4–8 In Arabidopsis thaliana, 441 nucleotides within mitochondrial mRNAs have been determined to be edited,9 and there are at least 26 edited sites in chloroplast transcripts from black pine.10 The majority of these RNA edited sites are found in protein coding regions, typically within the first or second letter of a codon; therefore, RNA editing usually alters the amino-acid sequence of the encoded protein in plant organelles. Such alterations in amino-acid sequence frequently improve sequence identity to other homologous proteins, suggesting that RNA editing is a process to repair ‘damaged’ codons.1 The editing process, therefore, must be highly specific.11The editing process is divided into two distinct steps: site recognition and nucleotide modification. The modification process occurs via deamination of the base,12,13 although the factor(s) mediating this process in plant organelles have not yet been identified. The recognition process for both mitochondrial and chloroplast RNA editing has remained a mystery. Cis-elements upstream of the editing sites have been identified in multiple mRNAs.14–20 Although rearrangements of nucleotides downstream of one of the editing sites in the maize rps12 mitochondrial mRNA did not affect the editing, similar rearrangements at another editing site within this sequence altered editing,11 suggesting that each editing site has different cis-elements at different positions. Miyamoto et al.21 identified three distinct trans-factor proteins that bound cis-elements at three different editing sites, suggesting that each RNA editing site is recognized by unique proteins. In vitro assays examining RNA editing in tobacco chloroplasts identified an RNA editing site in ndhB that requires a short upstream region for proper editing and one in ndhF that requires both upstream and downstream sequences surrounding the editing site and an additional 5′ distal sequence.22 The cis-elements found by those experiments were typically located within 15–30 nucleotides of the 5′ nucleotides of the editing sites.21,23 Several reports indicated nucleotide sequence similarity upstream of several different RNA editing sites,24,25 but there was no obvious consensus sequence motif for all the upstream sequences.9,26 Recently, a genetic approach identified CRR4 and CRR21, members of the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins, as essential trans-factors in chloroplasts for RNA editing site recognition.27–29 CRR4 specifically bound the 25 nucleotides upstream and 10 nucleotides downstream of the first editing site in ndhD mRNA.28 The length of the mRNA segment protected by CRR4 binding is similar to the length suggested to be necessary for editing site recognition. Arabidopsis thaliana has a huge number of members of the PPR protein family,30 proteins suggested to function in organelle biogenesis.31 Current advances in understanding the mechanisms of RNA editing in chloroplasts, which likely apply to mitochondrion as well, can be summarized as follows: (i) PPR proteins recognize several RNA editing sites, (ii) PPR proteins bind a region spanning from ∼30 nucleotides upstream to 10 nucleotides downstream of the editing site and (iii) the same protein may also convert the target cytidine to uridine.32Further understanding of RNA editing site recognition mechanisms in chloroplast transcripts can be achieved by computational analyses of nucleotide sequences aimed at identifying target nucleotides upstream and downstream of editing sites. For this type of analyses, multiple RNA editing sites with non-homologous nucleotide sequences are required. As the nucleotide sequences in homologous sites of homologous sequences are evolutionarily related, this conservation hampers the detection of functionally important nucleotide sequences essential in RNA editing site recognition. Although substantial known non-homologous RNA editing sites exist in mitochondrial mRNAs to allow these statistical calculations to be performed,33–36 those methods have not yet been applied to chloroplast RNA editing sites from a single species due to the paucity of known RNA editing sites. The maximum number of known C-to-U RNA editing sites in a chloroplast was 44 in the moth orchid Phalaenopsis aphrodite.37Transcripts from chloroplasts of the moss Takakia lepidozioides are thought to contain a large number of RNA editing sites,38 which may provide the opportunity to perform classification and motif analyses of RNA editing site surrounding sequences (−30 to +10 nucleotide). Here, we sequenced the genomic and mRNA transcripts from T. lepidozioides. We then performed statistical analyses of RNA editing site sequences and identified statistically significant patterns in the sequences. We used these patterns to predict novel RNA editing sites and experimentally verified these predictions.2. Materials and methods2.1. Amplification of plastid DNA fragments and analysis of cDNAWe extracted total cellular DNA from T. lepidozioides S. Hatt. & Inoue (Takakiaceae, Bryophyta) as described previously.38 We used the resulting sequences as a template for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using appropriate primers (Supplementary Table S1) with an initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 min, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 55°C for 1 min and extension at 72°C for 1 min, with a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min. Amplified DNA fragments were cloned into pGEM-T Easy plasmids (Promega, Madison, WI, USA). RNA extraction, first-strand cDNA synthesis and amplification of cDNA were performed as described.39 cDNA was amplified by PCR using appropriate primers (Supplementary Table S1) and subjected to direct sequencing. cDNAs encoding accD, ndhC, ndhJ, petA, petL, petG, psaJ, rpl33, rps18, rpl20, 5′-rps12 and clpP were cloned into pGEM-T Easy plasmids; at least two independent cDNA clones were sequenced for each cDNA.2.2. DNA sequencing and identification of RNA editing sitesDNA sequencing was performed as described39 using M13 universal primers and internal sequence primers designed from the sequences determined in this study (Supplementary Table S1). RNA editing sites were analyzed by comparing each cDNA sequence to that of genomic DNA. Nucleotide sequence data were deposited in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank database under the accession numbers AB299142, AB367138 (plastid DNA), AB299143–AB299154 and AB367139–AB367144 (cDNA).2.3. Classification of neighbor nucleotide sequences of RNA editing sitesWe collected sequences from each RNA editing site from 30 nucleotides upstream to 10 nucleotides downstream (41 nucleotides in total), which we named the neighbor sequence. After aligning these neighbor sequences without any gaps, we calculated the sequence identities. We used ungapped alignments here to avoid any dependency of the results on the value of gap penalty. Using dissimilarity, defined as 1.0-identity, as a distance among those sequences, we built a dendrogram using the neighbor-joining method.40 The dendrogram was expected to show only those sequence similarities derived from similarities in the recognition mechanism. On the basis of the obtained dendrograms, we divided the neighbor sequences into several groups at the first major branches from the root.2.4. Singlet and doublet propensities for each groupHere, we used the method of deducing functionally and structurally important residue position pairs from sets of functionally related sequences, originally proposed by Yura et al.41 The method used to calculate the propensities for residue positions was based on Kim et al.42 As we used cDNA to treat the nucleotide data, uridine is hereafter denoted as thymine.When Equations (1)–(6) were applied to the neighbor sequences of RNA editing sites from T. lepidozioides chloroplasts, the paucity of events in the count of nix and ni,jx,y hampered our ability to obtain valid values for Pix and Pi,jx,y. To minimize possible statistical error caused by a paucity of data, we employed pseudo-counts for nix and ni,jx,y.43 These pseudo-counts should reflect the a priori expectations of the occurrence of the nucleotides x and y; we used a background frequency to define these a priori expectations. Therefore, in the real-data calculations, nix was given by nix + bxN, and ni,jx,y was given by ni,jx,y + bi,jx,yN.The limited number of data reduced the statistical reliability of the calculated propensities. To estimate the standard deviation of Pix and Pi,jx,y, we used a bootstrap procedure in which we constructed bootstrap datasets based on 1000 resamplings, then calculated bootstrap replications of Pix and Pi,jx,y. We estimated standard deviations from these replications. We assessed the reliability of Pi,jx,y by the 5% significance Kolmogorov–Smirnov test to examine if the values derived from the replications followed a Gaussian distribution and by the 15% bootstrap percentile method to test if the values obtained using the entire data set were within a 15% deviation of the average values calculated from the replication.422.5. Application of propensities to predicting new RNA editing sites from a region covering petL to clpPWe applied the prediction to newly sequenced transcripts from T. lepidozioides chloroplasts and experimentally verified in a blind test if the predicted RNA editing sites were actually edited.3. Results and discussion3.1. Identification of RNA editing sites in T. lepidozioides chloroplastsWe previously identified 132 RNA editing sites in transcripts from the psbB operon and rpoA gene38 as well as one site in the tRNALeu anticodon39 of T. lepidozioides chloroplasts. To identify additional RNA editing sites, we determined the nucleotide sequences of a 27 kb plastid DNA region from rps4 to psbE (Fig. 1) and the cognate cDNAs. To identify RNA editing sites in rbcL, we compared the cDNA sequences in the database (AB427089) to the sequenced plastid DNA. This comparison of plastid DNA and cDNA sequences identified 170 novel RNA editing sites in a region between rps4 and psbE, including one site in the tRNALeu anticodon (Supplementary Table S2). All sites contained C-to-U conversions. In total, there were 302 RNA editing sites, 132 previously identified and 170 newly recognized, available for computational analysis.Gene arrangement of the region spanning rps4 to rps11 in the T. lepidozioides plastid genome.

Classification of 302 nucleotide sequences with RNA editing siteWe classified the 302 41-nucleotide sequences with the RNA editing site at the 31st position (neighbor sequences) from T. lepidozioides chloroplast (Fig. 2) in a dendrogram based on sequence identity. Grouping of the sequences, visualized by background color, was based on branching of the dendrogram. The threshold for grouping of the sequences was set at the second branching point of the dendrogram from the root. The 302 initial sequences were divided into eight groups, named G-1 to G-8. The largest group (G-1 plus G-2) was further divided into two groups, as the sequence identities within this group were very low. The average number of sequences in each group was ∼38, ranging from 21 to 57. Within each group, the sequences had a sequence identity with the other sequences in that group of at least 40%.Classification of neighbor sequences for RNA editing sites. We drew the classification dendrogram for 41-nt sequences based on sequence identity. The sequences were grouped at the second or third branching points. Each group, named from G-1 to G-8, was depicted by a background color. Each sequence was named based on the sequenced region and number of nucleotides. Note that the figure does not express the phylogenetic relation of the sequences.Classification of neighbor sequences for RNA editing sites. We drew the classification dendrogram for 41-nt sequences based on sequence identity. The sequences were grouped at the second or third branching points. Each group, named from G-1 to G-8, was depicted by a background color. Each sequence was named based on the sequenced region and number of nucleotides. Note that the figure does not express the phylogenetic relation of the sequences.Previous reports have been unable to identify common motifs in the neighbor sequences of RNA editing sites. The dendrogram in Fig. 2 demonstrates that although none of the neighbor sequences for RNA editing sites are similar, the sequences can be grouped into at least eight different patterns. These groups likely correspond to the neighbor sequence of RNA editing sites recognized by different trans-factors. Unique or similar trans-factors may recognize the neighbor sequences of each group; the classification derived from the dendrogram suggests that each trans-factor recognizes different neighbor sequences. To investigate this possibility, we analyzed the singlet and doublet propensities for each group and compared similarities in propensities within a group and differences between groups.3.3. Singlet and doublet propensities of each groupSinglet propensities for each group, shown in Fig. 3A, are expressed as a preference for individual nucleotides at each position in the neighbor sequence color-coded from red to blue on a log2 scale, with the exception of the RNA editing site (position 0). When statistically significant support could not be obtained for the singlet value of a nucleotide at that site, the log2 scaled singlet value was set as 0 and colored white. A deep red box indicates that the nucleotide appeared at that position twice as frequently as expected from a random distribution; a deep blue box indicates that the nucleotide appeared half as frequently as expected.(A) Singlet propensities of eight groups at each position for every nucleotide. The preference was color-coded from red to blue on a log2 scale, with the exception of the RNA editing site (position 0). When the value was not statistically significant, the singlet value was set to 0 and colored as white. The number of sequences in each group is noted at the bottom of each diagram. (B) All 53 neighbor sequences in group G-2. On the basis of this alignment, we calculated the singlet propensities for G-2 in A. Strong tendencies for specific nucleotides, found in A, at positions −10, −8, −5, −2 and +2 as well as the RNA editing site are boxed. At positions −10 and +2, G is favored, whereas T is favored at −2. At −8, G is avoided, and at −5, C is avoided. C at 0 is edited to U.(A) Singlet propensities of eight groups at each position for every nucleotide.

(B) All 53 neighbor sequences in group G-2. On the basis of this alignment, we calculated the singlet propensities for G-2 in A. Strong tendencies for specific nucleotides, found in A, at positions −10, −8, −5, −2 and +2 as well as the RNA editing site are boxed. At positions −10 and +2, G is favored, whereas T is favored at −2. At −8, G is avoided, and at −5, C is avoided. C at 0 is edited to U.Throughout the eight groups, several characteristics repeatedly observed from the singlet propensity values. At position −1, purine nucleotides were strongly avoided (deep blue) in all groups with favoring of pyrimidines, especially T.1,23,44 At position 1, C is unfavorable.1,23 With these two exceptions, we could not identify characteristics common to all the groups. Each group, however, has unique characteristics. In G-1, T at −26 and G at −4 and +8 were strongly favored, with G at −17, C at −14 and G at −5 being strongly disfavored. In G-2, G at −10, T at −2 and G at +2 were favored, and G at −8, C at −5 and G at −2 were disfavored. In G-3, G was favored at −25, whereas C at −23 and G at −21 and −1 were disfavored. In G-4, G at −13, A at −11 and G at −4 were favored, and G at −21, C at −18, C at −5, A/T at −4, G at −2 and A/G at −1 were all disfavored. In G-5, A at −26, C at −13, A at −12, G at −5 and A/G at −1 were disfavored. In G-6, G was favored at +1, but disfavored at −25 and −3. In G-7, G was favored at −30, and C at −28 and G at −5 were disfavored. In G-8, G was favored at −24, and G at −19, C at −12, G at −11, A at −7 and A at −1 were disfavored. The skewed distribution of nucleotides at each position may work as a marker for each RNA editing site facilitating the binding of site recognition trans-factors. G-1, G-2 and G-6 had strong markers both upstream and downstream of the editing site. The markers for G-2 sequences were located close to the RNA editing site, whereas the markers for G-3 were located remotely from the RNA editing sites. In contrast, the markers for G-6 and G-7 were sparsely located throughout the neighbor sequence. Those markers for G-2 are shown in Fig. 3B. Strong singlet propensities demonstrate conservation, as shown in red boxes, but do not necessarily mean perfect conservation. At position −8, singlet propensities describe that G is disfavored, appearing only once in the alignment. At position −5, C also appeared only once.RNA editing sites are frequently found at the second letter of a codon; the distribution of singlet propensity may reflect codon usage. If so, then the distribution pattern should have a period of three nucleotides in all places within the sequence. The patterns we observed, however, were free from periodicity and do not reflect the pattern of codons (Fig. 3A).As seen for the singlet propensities, strong favoring or disfavoring typically described G and C, suggesting the existence of base pair patterns in the neighbor sequences of RNA editing sites. We therefore analyzed the doublet propensities for each group (Fig. 4). For each pair position, there are 16 (=4 × 4) possible combinations of nucleotides. When no statistical significance could be achieved for the doublet propensity value of a given nucleotide pair position, the log2 scaled doublet propensity value was set to 0. We calculated the square sum of all log2-scaled positive and negative doublet propensities, which are color-coded in the upper and lower triangular portions of the matrix, respectively. All of the groups had pairs of positions with high positive values; high negative values were rarely seen in any of the groups. High values in the far off-diagonal portions of the matrix suggested that there would be long-range correlations in the neighbor sequences of RNA editing sites. An intriguing point is that high positive values were found at pairs of nucleotides located upstream and downstream of the RNA editing site.The magnitude of doublet propensities for the eight groups in a log2 scale at each pair of positions. At each position pair, there are 16 possible combinations of nucleotides. Each combination has a value for doublet propensity. When the value was not statistically significant, it was set to 0. A square sum of positive doublet propensity at each position was color-coded from white to red in the upper triangular portion of the matrix. A square sum of negative doublet propensity at each position was color-coded from white to blue in the lower triangular portion of the matrix. The number of statistically significant values for doublet propensity is noted at the top of each matrix. The maximum number of doublet propensities should be 12 480 (=40 nt × 39 nt/2 × 16 pairs).The magnitude of doublet propensities for the eight groups in a log2 scale at each pair of positions.

For the 65 pairs with positions of log2 doublet propensities >0.9, the appearance of the nucleotide pair is ∼1.87 times more frequent than random occurrence. Of the 65 cases, only 18 cases (28%) exhibited a potential for Watson–Crick base pairing. The remaining 47 cases were unable to form Watson–Crick base pairs. Twenty-nine pairs (45%) were formed by the same nucleotide, suggesting that the pair preferences observed for that nucleotide is not due to base pairing, but to other unknown causes, possibly restrictions stemming from the interactions between these positions and a trans-factor.Log2 doublet propensities >0.9 in each group*The statistically significant nucleotide pair in the parentheses appears at positions nt1 and nt2, respectively. We used the following rule of numbering nucleotide positions; position of the edited C was defined as 0, the nucleotides located on the 3′ side of the edited C had positive numbers and the nucleotides located on the 5′ side had negative numbers based on the distance in nucleotides from the C.Log2 doublet propensities >0.9 in each group*The statistically significant nucleotide pair in the parentheses appears at positions nt1 and nt2, respectively.

Yu et al.44 could not identify any RNA secondary structure motifs in the sequences surrounding mitochondrial RNA editing sites. Mulligan et al.11 confirmed these findings by demonstrating that the RNA editing sites in the mitochondria rps12 transcript did not have conserved RNA secondary structures. In contrast, Cummings and Myers33 analyzed RNA editing sites in mitochondria from three different species, discussing the possibility of secondary structure involvement in editing site recognition based on their free-energy calculations for RNA folding. Our study suggests that standard Watson–Crick pairs are not involved in the recognition processes.3.4. Application of the propensities to prediction of RNA editing siteAlthough the prediction of RNA editing sites in mitochondrial transcripts has been attempted by several groups,33–36 prediction of RNA editing sites in chloroplast transcripts has not been tried, as there are significantly fewer known RNA editing sites in chloroplast transcripts.One of the prediction methods that is widely used to identify RNA editing sites in chloroplast transcripts requires initial translation of the RNA into the amino-acid sequence followed by alignment of the homologous sequences. As RNA editing improves the amino-acid sequence identity of the edited sequence for homologous sequences, if a well-conserved position in the amino-acid sequence from the chloroplast gene is not conserved and C-to-U conversion within the codon can amend this difference, then the nucleotide is a candidate for an RNA editing site. This rule of thumb is practical, but cannot be used to detect silent RNA editing events that convert nucleotides at the third position in a codon and do not alter the encoded amino acid. In addition, a subset of editing events result in diversity of amino-acid sequences; this method also fails to identify this type of event.45 Furthermore, the method does not provide any understanding of the mechanism of RNA editing. Here, we apply the singlet and doublet propensities to neighbor sequences of RNA editing sites, as explained in Equation (8), to assess if this score can be a good predictor for the editing sites.We applied singlet and doublet propensities of group G-2 to the whole cDNAs (open reading frames) for the rps4–psbE and clpP–rpoA sequences (Fig. 1). Coding sequences were read with a moving window 41-nucleotide in length. When the 31st position was a C, we calculated the score based on Equation (8) and plotted in the histogram (Fig. 5). Red regions in the figure indicate a count of edited sequences in G-2, whereas the cyan regions indicate a count of non-edited sequences. As we deduced the propensities from the edited sequences in G-2, it is trivial that the red regions were clustered in high-score regions. It is not trivial, however, that non-edited sequences were rarely found in high-score regions and that a peak was found in low-score regions. Similar distribution patterns were observed for the other groups (Supplementary Fig. S1). On the basis of this prediction using propensities of G-2, sequences with scores >130 were certainly neighbor sequences of RNA edited sites and sequences with score >100 were neighbor sequences with a likelihood of ∼60%. If the threshold for editing site prediction was set at score 100, then the predicted sites reflected truly edited sites with an accuracy of 60% (true positive), with 40% that were not edited (false-positive) and 15% of true RNA editing sites were missed (false-negative). Similar conclusions were found for the other groups (Supplementary Fig. S1).Prediction score histogram for group G-2. The horizontal axis is the score in a bin of scale 10, and the vertical axis is the count of the prediction score in the bin. A red bar indicates the score for the edited C, and a bar in cyan indicates the score for a non-edited C. The prediction was performed for all transcripts (coding regions) between clpP and rpoA and between rps4 and psbE in the T. lepidozioides chloroplast genome. A bar for scores >70 has two numbers separated by a slash on the top. The number on the left is a count of the edited C, and the number on the right is the whole count in the bar.Prediction score histogram for group G-2. The horizontal axis is the score in a bin of scale 10, and the vertical axis is the count of the prediction score in the bin.

A bar for scores >70 has two numbers separated by a slash on the top. The number on the left is a count of the edited C, and the number on the right is the whole count in the bar.The current prediction method measures the similarity of given nucleotide sequences with the propensities of the set of known sequences. In this way, the method is similar to homology search methods. Most conventional homology search methods, however, do not account for the similarity of residue pairs; this method attempted to address this issue by introducing doublet propensity into the score. When the prediction score was dissected into terms derived from the singlet and doublet propensities, singlet propensities contributed 4–6%, whereas doublet propensities provided 94–96% of the score. The higher proportion contributed by the doublet propensities in the score makes this method significantly different from conventional homology search methods. In a 41-nucleotide sequence, there are 40 singlet propensities (the C at 31st position is not included in the score) and 780 (=40 × 39/2) doublet propensities, which is part of the reason why doublet propensities contribute to the score greater than singlet propensities.3.5. Application of the prediction to the newly sequenced portion of the T. lepidozioides chloroplast genomeThe most rigorous test of the prediction method is a blind test, in which we predict a result and verify the prediction experimentally. After sequencing the region between petL and clpP, we (i) predicted RNA editing sites in the transcript from that region and (ii) experimentally detected RNA editing sites after the prediction. We sequenced cDNA transcripts from petL to clpP (Fig. 1), identifying 42 C-to-U conversions in this region (Supplementary Table S2).We expected from the assessment of the prediction method that a score >100 has an accuracy of ∼60%. Seven of the 12 predicted sites (∼58%) were actually edited. Higher scores had a greater accuracy of prediction (Table 2). None of those predicted sequences were identical to the sequences obtained with the singlet and doublet propensities, which makes this result quite important. This blind test clearly demonstrated that a high score using our prediction method provides a high likelihood that the sequence contains an RNA editing site at the 31st position. In Table 2, there were two silent RNA editing sites that did not change the encoded amino-acid residues. Those two predictions can only be achieved using our method. The success of the prediction method above confirms that the characteristics described above (Figs 3A and 4) reflect tangible nucleotide patterns recognized by trans-factors.Prediction and verification of RNA editing sites (score > 101) in newly sequenced T. lepidozioides genome*Position is the nucleotide number of the predicted edited site (bold) in the sequenced region, whereas the minus number indicates that the editing site is predicted to be on the opposite strand of the deposited sequence. The codon number and conversion in the codon were shown for seven sites.Prediction and verification of RNA editing sites (score > 101) in newly sequenced T. lepidozioides genome*Position is the nucleotide number of the predicted edited site (bold) in the sequenced region, whereas the minus number indicates that the editing site is predicted to be on the opposite strand of the deposited sequence. The codon number and conversion in the codon were shown for seven sites.Experimental identification of RNA editing sites resulted in the identification of additional sites not listed in Table 2 (Supplementary Table S2). Our prediction method gave low scores to those sites. We assume that the RNA editing sites with low scores in our prediction are recognized by trans-factors independent from the ones that recognize G-1 to G-8 sequences (Fig. 2). The current prediction method is based on our classification of the RNA editing site neighbor sequences that may reflect similarities in the trans-factors that recognize those sequences. Therefore, an RNA editing site recognized by a different trans-factor cannot be predicted by this method. This may mean, however, that RNA editing sites recognized by homologous trans-factors, even in other species, can be predicted by the current propensities.3.6. Application of the prediction to the Araidopsis thaliana chloroplast genomeTo test if our method could identify RNA editing sites in other species, we applied our prediction method to the A. thaliana chloroplast genome. RNA editing sites in transcripts of A. thaliana chloroplasts have been extensively analyzed by Tillich et al.,25 and Chateigner-Boutin and Small46 have recently extended these studies. There are 32 known RNA editing sites in protein-coding regions. Our method determined scores >101 for 254 Cs in A. thaliana chloroplast transcripts (GenBank ID: AP000423). Six out of the verified 32 RNA editing sites were included in the 254 Cs. They are editing sites from psbF, clpP, rpoA, rpl23 and ndhB. There are 248 (=254−6) predicted RNA editing sites that have not been experimentally verified and 26 (=32−6) verified RNA editing sites that were missed by our prediction. The large number of predicted sites may contain sites that can be verified as true RNA editing sites, of which the top seven are listed in Table 3. If those predicted sites are false-positives, then the high score was obtained because of lack of information in the prediction method, the existence of trans-factors in T. lepidozioides that evolved to recognize different sequences or the disappearance of trans-factors during the course of evolution. The inability to predict the RNA editing sites in A. thaliana may be due to the existence of trans-factors for RNA editing site recognition that do not exist in T. lepidozioides.Predicted RNA editing site (score > 130) for A. thaliana chloroplast genome transcripts (AP000423)*Position is the nucleotide number of the predicted edited site (bold) in the sequence and the minus number indicates that the editing site is predicted to be on the opposite strand.Predicted RNA editing site (score > 130) for A. thaliana chloroplast genome transcripts (AP000423)*Position is the nucleotide number of the predicted edited site (bold) in the sequence and the minus number indicates that the editing site is predicted to be on the opposite strand.3.7. ConclusionWe classified the neighbor sequences of T. lepidozioides chloroplast RNA editing sites, taking advantage of the fact that chloroplast transcripts have multiple RNA editing sites. The neighbor sequences of RNA editing sites can be classified into eight groups using distinct singlet and doublet propensities. The differences in propensities among groups are hypothesized to result from recognition by different trans-factors for each group. The propensities predicted RNA editing sites using the nucleotide sequence alone and worked to predict sites in the genome of the same species. Our prediction was also able to identify silent RNA editing sites. Application of the prediction to chloroplast transcripts of a different species worked with a lower efficiency, yet the validity of these result needs to be experimentally tested.

IntroductionGenetic mapping is a basic tool of eukaryotic genomic research. Molecular linkage maps provide information about the organization of the genome and can be used for genetic studies and breeding applications. A high-density genetic linkage map is essential to physical map construction and also a powerful tool for the location and map-based cloning of desired gene(s). PCR-based DNA markers make such a linkage map possible. Of these PCR-based markers, AFLP markers were demonstrated to be a powerful new class of markers making it feasible to develop linkage maps for plants with a large genome.1 There are many linkage maps based on AFLP markers reported for various plants.2–6Lotus japonicus is an autogamous diploid legume species.7 As a model legume, it has many characteristics that make it a candidate for genomic research. These attributes are an autogamous diploid (2n = 12) and small genome (432∼494 Mb),8–10 short life cycle and transformation ability,6,11 making L. japonicus a model legume plant that can be used for molecular genetics and physiological studies. Genome synteny will help in marker preparation and gene cloning for other legume crops. To date, the cloning of various nodulation genes has been the subject of heated international competition. Therefore, the need for construction of a physical map covering the genome of L. japonicus is especially important. A primary genetic linkage map based on DAF (DNA Amplification Fingerprinting) markers with an F2 population from a cross of L. japonicus accessions, Gifu B-129 and Funakura B-581 has been reported.8 However, due to low polymorphism observed in this cross, the number of linkage groups did not cover all chromosomes of the genome. Crosses made with ‘Miyakojima MG-20’ showed the highest-level of polymorphisms relative to Gifu B-129 (>4%).12 Although this recombination rate is still low when compared with other plants,2–5 a fast and simple high efficiency genome scanning (HEGS)10 AFLP protocol system can overcome this disadvantage. Although traditional AFLP protocols simultaneously assay for large numbers of polymorphic bands on a single gel, developing more than 2000 AFLP markers is time consuming and laborious. The HEGS system allows the development of AFLP markers in a short time.10 The HEGS gel running apparatus is composed of a set of 24 cm × 26 cm glass plates. One hundred samples can be analyzed on a two-layer gel that is composed of 13% bis: arcylamide (19:1) separating gel and 5% stocking gel at 350 V for 4 h. As a result, 800 individuals can be analyzed on eight sets of plates per day by one person. By using the HEGS/AFLP system, some linkage maps have been developed for L. japonicus.13,14 For example, Hayashi et al.13 constructed a linkage map consisting of 287 markers (AFLP, SSR, dCAPS and other PCR-based markers) that spanned a total length of 487.3 cM and corresponded to six chromosomes in the Lotus genome using an F2 population from a cross of ‘Gifu B-129’ and ‘Miyakojima MG-20’. This study will use the map of Hayashi et al.13 as reference to build a high-density linkage map in L. japonicus.To construct a fine physical map, however, requires a linkage map of L. japonicus with sufficient high marker density (>1000 markers with less than 1 cM interval distance). This linkage map will also be used for gene cloning in future research. The resulting high-density linkage map created in this study will serve as a framework for building a genome physical map that will be suitable for map-based cloning in L. japonicus genetic research.2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materials and DNA extractionA cross of L. japonicus accessions ‘Gifu B-129’ and ‘Miyakojima MG-20’ was made at Kazusa DNA Institute, Japan. Gifu B-129 has a crawling habit with a red stem and Miyakojima MG-20 has erect habit with a green stem. A mapping population of 194 F6 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) was obtained by single-seed descent method. A collection of 94 from the 194 RILs was randomly selected as a mapping population for convenient analysis of the HEGS/AFLP running system.Genomic DNA was extracted from young leaves of the 94 individuals. In brief, 0.3 g of young leaves were collected in a 50 ml Falcon tube including five metal beads, immersed in liquid nitrogen and ground with a shaker (EYELA cute Mixer CM-100), 250 rpm, 30 s, twice. Immediately, the powder was incubated with 2 ml extraction buffer (10% CTAB: 10% SDS and sodium lanroylsarcosine = 1:2, preheated) at 65°C for 1 h with gentle shaking. About 2 ml of aqueous phase were transferred to a 6-tube strips and DNA was extracted automatically using KURABO NA-2000 (Japan) following the manufacturer's instructions. The DNA pellet was dried and dissolved in 50–100 µl 0.1 × TE (10 mM Tris–HCl and 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0). The dissolved DNA samples were treated with RNase A (50 µg/ml) for 3 h at 37°C.2.2. SSR analysisMicrosatellite (SSRs) and dCAPS analysis were performed based on the methods of Sato et al.15 with the minor modifications. Genomic DNA (0.2 ng) was used in a total volume of 5 µl containing 0.0125 U Extaq polymerase (TaKaRa, Japan). The annealing temperature was set to 60°C. The sequence information of all SSR and dCAPS primers (written in TM prefix with serial number) can be found in Sato et al.15 All the TM primers were synthesized from Invitrogen, Life Technologies, Japan.2.3. AFLP analysisThe AFLP assays were performed as described by Vos et al.1 with the following modifications. Genomic DNA samples (250 ng) were digested with 8 U of EcoRI and 5 U of MseI (Biolabs Inc., New England) in a reaction volume of 25 µl with 1× Not I preservation buffer (10 mM Tris–HCl, pH 7.5, 100 mM KCl, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 0.01% BSA, 0.15% Triton X-100, 50% glycerol), mixed briefly and incubated at 37°C for 3 h. Five microliters of the digestion solution were mixed with 1 µl EcoRI adapter (5 pmol/µl), 1 µl MseI adapter (50 pmol/µl), 1 µl 10× ligation buffer and 28 U of T4 DNA ligase (TaKaRa) in a total of 10 µl of reaction volume and incubated at 37°C overnight. This digestion–ligation solution was diluted 10-fold in 0.1× TE buffer and used for pre-amplification. Pre-amplification was conducted in 25 µl reaction volume containing 2.5 µl diluted adaptor-ligated DNA, 1 µl EcoRI+A primer (5 ng/µl), 1 µl MseI+C primer (30 ng/µl), 2 µl 2.5 mM dNTP each, 2.5 µl ExTaq buffer and 0.5 U ExTaq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa). The PCR profile was 94°C for 30 s, 56°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min and 20 cycles with a 10 min final extension at 72°C. The PCR products were diluted 100-fold in 0.1× TE buffer and stored at −20°C until further use. Selective amplification was performed in 5 µl reaction volume containing 2.45 µl diluted pre-amplification products, 0.5 µl EcoRI +3 primer (7 ng/µl) and 1.125 µl MseI+3 primer (7 ng/µl), 0.4 µl 2.5 mM dNTP each, 0.5 µl ExTaq buffer and 0.025 U ExTaq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa). The touchdown PCR profile was one cycle at 94°C for 30 s, 68°C for 30 s and 72°C for 60 s, 17 cycles with the annealing temperature reduced 0.7°C/cycle, and 23 cycles with an annealing temperature of 56°C and with final extension at 72°C for 10 min.2.4. Gel running with HEGS running systemFive microliters of PCR samples were mixed with 1 µl loading buffer (0.25% xylene cyanol, 0.25% bromophenol blue, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0, 40% glycerol) and separated using the HEGS running system.5 In brief, 6 µl of each sample per lane were loaded into polyacrylamide gels consisting of stacking gel (upper-side gel, 2.5 cm in depth, 5% bis-polyacrylamide contained 0.5 M Tris–HCl, pH 6.8) and running gel (lower-side gel, 13% bis-polyacrylamide contained 1.5 M Tris–HCl, pH 8.8). A total of 94 F6 individuals and two parents and ΦX174-Hae III (50 ng/lane) in one gel was run in 1× Tris–glycine buffer (25 mM Tris–HCl, pH 8.3, 1.92 M glycine) at 100 V for 80 min followed 350 V for 4.5 h. The gels were stained in 1/10 000 volume Vistra Green dye solution (Amersham Pharmacia Biotech) for 10–20 min, washed in water for 5–10 min and scanned in FluorImager 575 (Molecular Dynamics, Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). We therefore employed the HEGS/AFLP analysis with 94 F6 recombination lines from a cross of ‘Gifu B-129’ and ‘Miyakojima MG-20’ to develop a large number of markers. This approach attempts to construct a high-density linkage map containing ∼2000 markers with an average of <1 cM interval distance between markers.2.5. Data collectionClear polymorphic bands were selected using the F2 generation genome analysis software (Kazusa DNA Research Institute, Japan), and the bands were confirmed visually. This software also automatically assigned molecular weights to the fragments, distinguished the single polymorphic band from parents before manually setting paternal and maternal alleles, and generated reports of fragment presence/absence in 1/0 binary type. Only clearly visible markers were scored. For F6 progeny, band presence associated with the Gifu B-129 allele was coded as A; band presence with Miyakojima MG-20 allele was coded as B, and those bands with both female and male parent were coded as H for heterozygote. Each AFLP marker was identified by a code referring to the primer combination, EM (EcoRI/MseI) and character G (associated with Gifu B-129 allele), M (associated with Miyakojima MG-20 allele) or C (co-dominant marker), followed by the estimated size of the DNA fragment in nucleotides. The heterozygote (for the co-dominant markers) and missing data were coded as ‘-’.Eight morphological traits, plant type (PT), stem pigment (SP), leaflet (LL), stipule (ST), petiole (PE), trichome (TR), seed color (SC) and seed size (SS), were scored as qualitative traits. We scored grade 1–5 for all traits. PT: 1—crawl stem and 5—stand stem; SP: 1—light color (green) stem and 5—dark color (red) stem; LF: 1—no LL and 5—long LL; ST: 1—no ST on the petal and 5—most STs; PE: 1—none and 5—longest; TR: 1—no TR and 5—most; SC: 1—lightest color and 5—dark (brown); SS: 1—smallest and 5—largest.2.6. Linkage map constructionBefore linkage analysis, chi-square tests (χ2) were performed on both SSR and AFLP markers for goodness of fit to the expected Mendelian 1:1 segregation ratio of each marker. Distorted loci that deviated significantly at P < 0.01 were excluded from map construction. Linkage analysis was performed with the Joinmap 3.0.16 Initially, an LOD score of 14.0 was used to identify six linkage groups, corresponding to six chromosomes of Lotus genome based on the previously mapped SSR/dCAPS markers13 (details can also be found from http://www.kazusa.or.jp/lotus/markerdb_index.html). The Kosambi mapping function17 was used to convert recombination frequencies into map distances. Linkage maps were drawn using MapChart 2.1 software.18A subset of markers spanned across the linkage map with even distance of 5 cM was selected and used for composite interval mapping.19 Quantitative traits loci (QTL) analysis was carried out using WinQTL Cartographer 2.5.203. Results3.1. AFLP markers generated in HEGS systemNinety-four F6 individuals and two parents were analyzed on a single gel (Fig. 1); 4096 EcoRI–MseI primer combinations were first screened on the parental DNAs (data not shown). Of the primer pairs (Supplement 1) that produced the most polymorphic bands, 427 were selected for further AFLP analysis for 94 random individuals of F6 population. Initially, a total of 2053 diagnostic AFLP markers, which included 739 Gifu B-129 dominant, 674 Miyakojima MG-20 dominant and 640 co-dominant markers, were scored (Fig. 2, Table 1). On average, 4.8 AFLP markers and 1.5 co-dominant markers were generated per primer combination, with a range of 2–8 visible markers (data not shown). The polymorphism ratio per primer pair combination agreed with that of Kawaguchi et al.12 The electrophoresis profile (Fig. 1) scanned by the FluorImager 575 provided sufficient resolution to distinguish fragment mobility from 70 to 5000 bp, indicating a wide range of the amplification fragments with high resolution using the HEGS/AFLP-SSR running system (in ∼24 cm long gel). A total of 95 SSR and 2 dCAPS markers that mapped on the previous linkage map13 was also separated using HEGS running system.A sample of AFLP gel profile with a combination of E-ATG I/M-ACC primers for 94 F6 individuals from a cross of L. japonicus accessions, ‘Gifu B-129’ and ‘Miyakojima MG-20’ with HEGS system.

In this case, each segregating marker was tested with a χ2 test for goodness-of-fit to the expected 1:1 Mendelian segregating ratio. As a result, 131 of the 2053 markers (6.4%) were distributed to a skewed segregation with significance at P ≤ 0.01, and 575 markers (28%) were distorted at P ≤ 0.05. Most skewed segregating markers deviated to Miyakojima MG-20 alleles. In this study, the distributions of 82 of these 131 markers inclined to Miyakojima MG-20 and only 49 to Gifu B-129 (Table 1). Five SSR markers were distorted significantly at the 1% level, of which three were distorted to Gifu B-129 and two to Miyakojima MG-20. However, these five SSR markers were retained in the mapping analysis because their distribution frequencies were near to P = 0.01. The AFLP markers skewed at the 1% level were discarded and excluded in the data analysis. About 24% of the SSR markers were skewed at the 5% level and included in the map analysis (Table 1). As a result, a total of 1588 AFLP markers and 97 SSR including 2 dCAPS markers were mapped on the linkage map of L. japonicus.3.2. Construction of linkage mapAll AFLP markers and 95 SSR and 2 dCAPS markers were run on JoinMap® 4 to generate six groups at an LOD value of 14.0, with a maximum distance of 30 cM. Using the SSR markers on each group as references, these six groups were assigned to chromosome 1–6 of L. japonicus.13 A high-density linkage map for L. japonicus was generated; 533 co-dominant AFLP markers and 97 SSR (including 2 dCAPS markers) were mapped on six chromosomes of L. japonicus, with an additional 958 AFLP markers (504 Gifu associated and 454 Miyakojima associated markers, Table 2). A total of 1588 markers were mapped on the six chromosome maps (Supplement 2). This linkage map consisted of 1013 unique markers (excluded duplicated markers) and spanned a total length of 508.5 cM with an average of 0.50 cM between markers. The range of the length of each chromosome varies from 50.1 cM (chromosome 2) to 131.7 cM (chromosome 1), with a mean of 84.7 cM (Table 2, Fig. 3).Linkage maps of chromosome 1–6 of Ljaponicus genome Marker names were assigned based on the combination of EcoRI and MseI AFLP primers with generated marker size (in base pair). Letter G stands for maternal ‘Gifu B-129’ associated marker; M for paternal ‘Miyakojima’ associated marker and C for co-dominant markers. All SSR/dCAPS markers assigned as TM (Hayashi et al.13 and visit at http://www.kazusa.or.jp/lotus/markerdb_index.html). Morphological QTL: SS stands for seed size; LL for leaflet; SC for seed color; ST for stipule; PE for petiole; TR for trichrome; PT for plant type and SP for stem pigment.Linkage maps of chromosome 1–6 of Ljaponicus genome Marker names were assigned based on the combination of EcoRI and MseI AFLP primers with generated marker size (in base pair).

After the map of each chromosome for each parent was constructed, several markers with almost an equal distance interval of <10 cM were used as frame markers to scan eight phenotypic markers within the linkage map of each chromosome. As a result, 14 QTLs were detected on six chromosomes for the eight morphological traits. There were six QTLs detected on chromosome 4, only one QTL on chromosomes 3, 5 and 6 (Table 2). SS showed five QTLs and was distributed to five chromosomes except for chromosome 5. LL and SC presented two QTLs. SP, PT, ST, PE and TR showed only one QTL, indicating control by a single gene (Table 2, Fig. 3).The duplicated markers presented in six chromosomes, resulting in significant clustering in the whole genome, especially in the center region of each chromosome. To decrease the numbers of markers, all duplicated markers will be excluded on the each chromosome map (Fig. 3). So Fig. 3 presented only unique markers. All requirements about the details of mapped markers should be address to the corresponding authors.3.3. Characterization of the linkage mapChromosome 1 had the largest number of markers (373) and longest genetic distance (131.7 cM). Chromosome 5 had the fewest number of markers (184) and chromosome 2 has shortest genetic distance (50.1 cM). The average interval distance between markers (excluded the duplicated markers) was 0.50 cM for all chromosomes. Chromosome 1 (0.64 cM) had the longest and chromosome 2 (0.33 cM) had the shortest average interval distance between markers. The other four chromosomes had similar average interval distances (Table 2). The distorted markers were mainly mapped on distal parts of chromosome 5 (marked with asterisk on chromosome 5 in Fig. 3). Chromosome 6 also showed some distorted markers, dispersed through the chromosome. The clustering of markers occurred on the center region of all six chromosomes (Fig. 3).4. Discussion4.1. Determination of the linkage map of each chromosomeBefore determining the chromosome of the genome, all AFLP and SSR markers were combined and analyzed with JoinMap® 3.0.16 At the LOD of 14.0, six big groups were generated. On the basis of the distribution of SSR markers13 within each group, we were able to locate six groups to six corresponding chromosomes of L. japonicus. After running the JoinMap® 3.0 program for each group, a linkage map on each chromosome was determined. The orders of these SSR markers on each chromosome were the same as those in the map of created by Hayashi et al.13 except for some minor differences for some markers. Therefore, we confirmed the six groups correspond to the six chromosomes of Lotus genome.4.2. The length of linkage mapThis linkage map spans a total genetic distance of 508.5 cM in L. japonicus genome, slightly longer than those of previous maps.13,14 This can be explained by the marker numbers dramatically increased in the present mapping population. The larger number of markers within one linkage group may enlarge the genetic intercrossing value between markers. Additionally, the small size of the F6 population (94 individuals) compared with 127 F2 individuals in Hayashi et al.13 may not be enough for allele segregation and cause allele partial distribution.The lengths of chromosome 3–6 were very close to the lengths of Hayashi's results.13 However, they were nearly 30 cM longer for chromosome 1 and 30 cM shorter for chromosome 2 than the reference map.13 Hayashi et al.13 reported that there was a translocation region between the chromosome 1 and 2 in both parents' map. This translocation could have caused unequal crossover in the second generation and inherited to sixth generation. Fragment deletion may also occur during the translocation. In the present map, chromosome 1 is 131.7 cM in length and chromosome 2 is only 50.1 cM in length. The difference of 30 cM is supposed to be the translocation fragment, compared with Hayashi et al.13 chromosome 1 and 2 map. However, the map length of chromosome 1 and 2 are very close to that of Sandal et al.14 map of L. japonicus from a cross of L.filicaulis×L. japonicus.To further confirm the reliability of this linkage map, we developed a total of 300 AFLP co-dominant markers with the same primer-pair combinations and 97 SSR markers with 94 F9 individuals derived from same F6 individuals. With the same calculation, these 397 markers were located on six chromosomes and the order was generally the same within each chromosome, although there is a slight difference for some distances between markers. So this linkage map is reliable to use as a framework for physical map construction and map-based cloning in L. japonicas.4.3. Clustering of the markersThe clustering of markers on each chromosome occurred significantly in this study. AFLP markers characteristically cluster in centromeric and/or telomeric regions in plant species with large genome.21–24 Clustering of markers occurred mainly at heterochromatin-rich centromeric regions that ascribed to the great portions of repetitive sequences frequently present, and these repetitive sequences suppressed recombination between chromosomes.21 Also, a high degree of clustering of markers in the AFLP map is much more pronounced than in the RFLP map.25 There may be some very small variation, possibly, 1 bp deletion/insertion in repetitive sequences that can be detected by the AFLP technique, but not by RFLP technique. Thus, AFLP markers can be relatively easy to generate in highly repetitive regions near centromere.22 In the present study, of the 1588 mapped markers, 575 duplicated markers will be excluded in the Fig. 3. Most significant clustering of markers located near the centromeric region.Although the significant clusters presented, map gaps were found in whole genome, but much smaller than previous map. The biggest gap of 13.7 cM was found on chromosome 4. The gaps on other chromosomes ranged from 3.8 to 7.7 cM.In this study, the rapid and efficient development of the linkage map with high resolution of L. japonicus was facilitated by the HEGS/AFLP system, by which a total of 1588 AFLP markers was mapped on the L. japonicus genome in 6 months. This map created a framework for anchoring EST, SSR and other sequence-based markers, and built the foundation for physical map construction in L. japonicus and gene cloning in other legume crops.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis work was supported by the fund for the Promotion of Basic Research Activities for Innovative Biosciences (BRAIN), Japan.Supplementary data"

IntroductionSoybean [Glycine max (L.) Merr.] is one of the most important crops in the world. The agronomical importance of soybean has been steadily increasing, since it is an important source for protein and vegetable oil for human and animal nutrition. In addition, soybean serves as a valuable renewable agricultural source for industrial products, e.g. lubricating oil, printing ink or biodiesel.1 Owing to this importance of soybean, its agronomical features should be distinguished at the molecular level to facilitate breeding, gene discovery or industrial applications.At the present time, access to a large set of genomic information is huge benefit for biological or agronomical research. In the past decade, a large amount of genomic information had been compiled from a number of organisms involving several model plants.2–5 The vast amount of sequence information, including not only whole-genome sequences but also other information such as transcriptome, proteome or metabolome data, has enabled scientists to extend our understandings for genomic structures, evolution, gene discovery or gene functions, etc.6The genome size of soybean is large (1115 Mb with 2n = 40) and it likely arose from complex genome duplication events.7,8 It was suggested that at least one of the original genomes was duplicated prior to the most recent polyploidization event in soybean.7 Despite such complexity, the draft sequence of soybean genome has been already released (http://www.phytozome.net/soybean). Furthermore, genomic sequencing has been conducted for two model legume plants, Lotus japonicus and Medicago truncatula, and a large set of Lotus genomic sequence data are now available.9 These data will provide us a great potential to a broad range of plant science as well as legume research.In addition to an entire genome sequence, a catalog of gene transcripts can also serve as a critical resource for molecular studies. Actually, >390 000 soybean expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences have already been obtained (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/dbEST/) from different tissues, organs, seeds and developmental stages of soybean. These data serve as a valuable resource to help describe gene expression profiles and ultimately classify genes by families and functions.10 Especially, full-length cDNA collections can serve as a powerful tool to facilitate genomic or other omics research efficiently. Several techniques have been established to prepare full-length cDNA enriched libraries from various organisms,11–13 and the usefulness of full-length cDNAs has been confirmed in various plants such as Arabidopsis, rice, poplar, wheat and maize.14–19 A major advantage of this approach is that the most of clones contain the complete coding sequences as well as the 5′- and 3′-untranslated regions (UTRs). Inclusion of the entire sequence data dramatically facilitates the subsequent sequencing, annotation, and protein expression and other functional assays.18 Furthermore, a large collection of full-length sequences of cDNA clones also provides a set of protein sequences allowing us to estimate gene functions by searching homology to other proteins, conserved domains or motifs. Thus, the preparation and analysis of full-length cDNA clones maybe closely connected to soybean genomic sequencing projects.In the present study, we report a large-scale collection of full-length cDNA clones derived from a Japanese soybean cultivar, Nourin No. 2. Soybean was domesticated in East Asia, where various kinds of landraces have been established as a result of adaptation to different environments and the diversification of food cultures. ‘Nourin No. 2′ is an elite cultivar which had been developed by cross-breeding and is one of the ancestors of Japanese modern cultivars. It has many typical features of Japanese soybean, for example, a white seed coat, a relatively large seed size and high protein content. We constructed a full-length-enriched cDNA library from Nourin No. 2 and obtained 22 674 non-redundant cDNA sequences from 5′ or 3′ end sequences of 39 936 randomly selected clones from the library. In addition, the entire sequences of 4712 full-length cDNAs were determined. We designed a web-based interface to retrieve sequence information of soybean full-length cDNA clones (http://rsoy.psc.riken.jp/). The information and resources pertaining to full-length soybean cDNAs will be publicly available from the National Bioresource Project for Lotus/Glycine in Japan (http://www.legumebase.agr.miyazaki-u.ac.jp/).2. Materials and methods2.1. Plant materialsSoybean [G. max (L.) Merr. cv. Nourin No. 2] was used to construct a full-length cDNA library. In this study, we prepared soybean plants under various developmental and environmental conditions: (1) drought stress, (2) salt stress, (3) chilling stress (4°C), (4) low temperature (15°C), (5) phosphorous starvation, (6) flooding, (7) nematode infection, (8) flower buds, (9) nodules and (10) developing seeds. These growth conditions and treatments are summarized in Table 1, and the procedures are described as follows.Collection of RNA samples for constructing a soybean full-length cDNA libraryWe prepared RNA samples from soybean plants distributed by several laboratories in Japan. The regions, conditions and treatments for soybean plants widely ranged as shown here. Additional information was described in Materials and Methods.aThe latitude and longitude for each place is as follows: Ibaraki, 36°0′N, 140°1′E; Hokkaido1, 43°1′N, 141°9′E; Hokkaido2, 43°3′ N, 141°2′ E; Chiba, 35°8′N, 139°9′E and Saga, 33°2′N, 130°3′E.Collection of RNA samples for constructing a soybean full-length cDNA libraryWe prepared RNA samples from soybean plants distributed by several laboratories in Japan. The regions, conditions and treatments for soybean plants widely ranged as shown here. Additional information was described in Materials and Methods.aThe latitude and longitude for each place is as follows: Ibaraki, 36°0′N, 140°1′E; Hokkaido1, 43°1′N, 141°9′E; Hokkaido2, 43°3′ N, 141°2′ E; Chiba, 35°8′N, 139°9′E and Saga, 33°2′N, 130°3′E.Drought, salt and chilling stresses. Soybean seeds were sown in vermiculite for 7 days, then seedlings were grown hydroponically under greenhouse conditions (36°0′N, 140°1′E, Tsukuba, Japan). Average temperature was 21°C, and day length was 14 h. Seedlings were cultured in 30 L vessels containing a nutrient solution as previously described.20 Two-week-old seedlings were exposed to a drought stress by withholding nutrient solution, and salt stress was produced by supplementing plants with a nutrient solution containing 100 mM NaCl. For cold stress, seedlings were transferred into a refrigerate chamber in which temperature was controlled to 4°C. Seedlings were harvested at 0, 1, 5, 10 and 24 h after the initiation of stresses. Each plant sample was stored at −80°C until use.Low temperature treatment. As previously described, soybean plants were grown in a growth chamber at 22/17°C with 15 h light until the first trifoliate leaves were fully expanded.21 The only exception was that culture soil Sankyo Engei Baido, containing 374 mg of N, 647 mg of P and 201 mg of K (Hokkai Sankyo, Sapporo), was used. The plants were subsequently grown at 15/15°C for 1 h, 1 and 4 days before total RNA was isolated from the whole shoots.Phosphorous starvation. Soybean seeds were surface sterilized with 70% ethanol for 30 s with subsequent washing in deionized water. Sterilized seeds were sown in vermiculite for 7 days and seedlings were subsequently grown hydroponically under greenhouse conditions (43°3′N, 141°2′E, Sapporo, Japan). Average temperature was 24°C and day length was 13–14 h. Eight seedlings were cultured in a 56 L vessel, containing a nutrient solution made up of 0.83 mM N (NH4NO3), 0 µM (−P solution) or 32 µM (+P solution) NaH2PO4, 0.38 mM K (KCl), 0.19 mM K (K2SO4), 0.75 mM Ca (CaCl2·2H2O), 0.82 mM Mg (MgSO4·7H2O), 35.8 µM Fe (FeSO4·7H2O), 9.1 µM Mn (MnSO4·4H2O), 46.3 µM B (H3BO3), 3.1 µM Zn (ZnSO4·7H2O), 0.16 µM Cu (CuSO4·5H2O) and 7.4 nM Mo [(NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O]. The concentration of phosphorus, as well as the pH (5.3 ± 0.1), was adjusted every day. Plants were harvested after 2 weeks and stored at −80°C until further use.Flooding treatment. The water content in soybean seeds was treated at 15% in the humidity conditioning chamber. The seeds were immersed and germinated in the tubs with sterilized water at a depth of 5 cm. The flooding treatments were imposed for 3 or 5 days at 25°C under dark conditions. Germinating seedlings were washed with the water and were then used for the isolation of total RNA.Inoculation of soybean cyst nematode (SCN: Heterodera glycines Ichinohe). Soybean plants were grown in the field infested with SCN race 3 in Sarabetsu, Hokkaido (43°1′N, 141°9′E) on 14 May 2003. Ten inoculated plans were harvested after 50 days from sowing and their roots from the plants were washed free of soil and used for the isolation of total RNA. Average temperature was 15°C, and day length was 15 h.Flower buds and nodules. Soybean plants were grown in a greenhouse or a field at Matsudo, Japan (35°8′N, 139°9′E; average temperature, 25°C; day length, 14 h). Flower buds were excised from field-grown soybean plants at 50 days after sowing (DAS), and roots and nodules were sampled at 20 and 50 DAS. Alternatively, soybean plants were grown in vermiculite with a Hyponex solution (HYPONeX Japan, Osaka, Japan) under a greenhouse condition. Inoculation with a suspension of Bradyrhizobium japonicum strains A1017 and USDA110 (each 1 × 108 cells/mL) was carried out twice on the first and third day after sowing. Roots and nodules were sampled at 20 and 50 DAS.For developing seeds, soybean plants were grown in a greenhouse at Saga, Japan (33°2′N, 130°3′E; average temperature, 20–27°C; day length, 14 h). Developing seeds were harvested at 7, 14, 25, 35 and 50 days after flowering. The harvested samples were separated into six pools by seed-length (under 5, 5–7, 7–9, 9–12, 12–15, and over 15 mm), and they were stored at −80°C until use.2.2. RNA extractionTotal RNA was extracted from soybean plants using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instruction. An alternative protocol was used for developing seeds as follows; frozen samples were crushed to a fine powder with a mortar and pestle in liquid N2. Each crushed sample was homogenized with 5 volumes (FW/V) of 100 mM Tris–HCl buffer (pH 8.0) containing 90 mM LiCl, 4.5 mM EDTA and 1% SDS, and 2 volumes of water-saturated phenol. After adding 1 volume of 2 M sodium acetate (pH 4.0) and 2 volumes of chloroform, the aqueous phase was separated by centrifugation at 10 000g for 10 min. The aqueous phase was re-extracted three times with phenol:chloroform (1:1, v/v) and chloroform. Total RNA was precipitated as a lithium salt by adding 3 volumes of 8 M LiCl. For cDNA library construction, contaminated oligosaccharides were removed from total RNA with the glass fiber-mediated method according to the manufacturer’s instructions (RNeasy Plant Kit, QIAGEN).2.3. Construction of a full-length-enriched cDNA libraryAliquots of total RNA from plant materials (Table 1) were mixed equally, and the RNA mixture was used for the construction of a full-length-enriched cDNA library. Construction of the library was accomplished by the biotinylated CAP trapper method and trehalose-thermoactivated reverse transcriptase as described in the previous reports.11,22 The resultant double-strand cDNAs were ligated into a λFLC-III vector.232.4. Both-ends sequencing of soybean cDNA clonesThe DNA of each clone was directly amplified from 384 bacterial cultures of a glycerol stock plate by the RCA method24 using a TempliPhi HT DNA amplification kit (GE Healthcare, UK). End sequencing of 39 936 clones was carried out using ABI 3700 capillary sequencers (Applied Biosystems). The M13-21 primer (5′-TGTAAAACGACGGCCAGT-3′) and the 1233 primer (5′-AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGA-3′) were used for forward and reverse sequencing, respectively.2.5. Sequence data trimming and assemblyRaw sequence data were base-called using the Phred program25,26 and the low quality region (Phred quality score <20, and more than 20 bases repeated) which was found at both edges of each raw sequence was discarded. We used the sim4 program27 for the detection of vector sequences. Sequence data of lengths shorter than 100 bases after this trim process were omitted. In addition, if the repetition of a single nucleotide in a sequence was longer than 10% of its total length, we rejected such sequence. Sequences with high similarity to the soybean cystnematode (SCN: Heterodera glycines) gene (BLASTN e-value <1e−50) were also removed. The ESTs were assembled by the CAP3 program28 with 40 bp overlap and 90% sequence identity. All EST sequences were submitted to the DNA Databank of Japan (DDBJ) under accession numbers BW650749–BW684913 and DB955456–DB990717.2.6. Full-length sequencing for soybean cDNAsWe selected 4712 clones from the GMFL01 clone set for full-length sequencing, according to their expression profiles (as described in Results and discussions). One representative clone from each contig was selected, and a total of 4712 clones were re-arrayed from the original plates to new 384-well plates. The DNA of each clone from the re-arrayed plates was amplified as described above. Full-length sequencing was performed by both primer walking and shotgun methods using ABI 3730 capillary sequencers (Applied Biosystems). In the finishing process, the Phred/Phrap/Consed system25,26,29 was used to assemble sequences. All full-length sequences were submitted to the DDBJ under the accession numbers AK243693–AK246134 and AK285150–AK287419.2.7. Full-length cDNA library qualityThe quality of the soybean full-length cDNA library was evaluated as follows: (i) a clone had both 5′ and 3′ sequence data, (ii) the e-values in a search result of 5′-sequence with fastx3430 was less than 1e−30 against the NCBI non-redundant protein data set, (iii) the aligned reading frame was oriented in the plus direction, (iv) the fastx34 alignment of 5′-sequence data was initiated by a methionine residue and (v) a poly (A)+ tail existed in the 3′-sequence. Subsequent to these analyses, clones fulfilling these aforementioned conditions were regarded as full-length soybean cDNAs containing 5′-UTR, CDS and 3′-UTR.2.8. Scaffold constructionTo obtain a non-redundant set of transcripts, we clustered 5′ or 3′ end sequences according to clone names in the CAP3 output. The ‘.ace’ file and the ‘.singlets’ from the CAP3 output were parsed to build scaffolds, which are clusters of sequences representing a unique transcript for which the positional relation and direction of the fragments is implied.2.9. Annotation of the sequencesAfter these scaffolds were created, the sequences were queried against several public databases. As a means to estimate similarity to genes from other plants, the sequences were assigned to known information by the BLASTX search (e-value <1e−5) against protein data sets from TAIR,31 RAP-DB,32 JGI Poplar4 and KOGs.33,34 The sequences were also submitted to the BLASTN search (e-value <1e−30) against nucleotide data sets from L. japonicus and M. truncatula in the NCBI UniGene collections.35 We subsequently classified the results to show some differences between soybean and other plants. The sequences excluded in all searches were submitted to the InterPro version 4.2 with DBrelease12.136 to identify their functional domains. On the other hand, for the detection of novel soybean genes, we used the data sets from the UniGene cluster and complete CDSs of G. max in GenBank for the BLASTN analysis. We selected soybean cDNA clones showing their e-values >1e−100, then they were regarded as novel soybean transcripts.2.10. UTR detectionFor detecting UTR sequences in ESTs, we used the fully sequenced scaffolds of the resulting CAP3 assembly. First, we found potential ORFs in each fully sequenced scaffold with our original perl scripts. We selected the longest of potential ORFs with the sense directions in each scaffold. Then, ESTs which consisted of the scaffold were aligned with sim4 to the selected ORFs, and we obtained the start and end points of CDSs and UTRs in the EST sequences. We omitted some ESTs in which the edge position of the sim4 alignment to the selected ORF was unclear.3. Results and discussion3.1. Construction of the soybean full-length-enriched cDNA libraryHere, we constructed a soybean full-length-enriched cDNA library using the biotinylated CAP trapper method which is optimized to generate a large percentage of full-length cDNA inserts.11,22 At first, we prepared 10 kinds of soybean plants in collaboration with several project members from southern to northern parts of Japan (Table 1). Then, we mixed each RNA sample from soybean plants that were grown under various conditions, e.g. drought, salt and cold stresses, Pi starvation, flooding and SCN infection. Finally, the efficiency of our library was 1.1 × 106 pfu with a λFLCIII vector, and we prepared two sets (GMFL01 and GMFL02) of 19 968 cDNA clones (52 × 384-well plates) from the library.3.2. The quality of soybean full-length-enriched cDNA libraryThe outline of the cDNA library construction and data analysis was illustrated in Fig. 1. We prepared two sets of 19 968 clones (GMFL01 and GMFL02) and a total of 39 936 clones were sequenced from 5′ and 3′ ends. Sequences were subsequently trimmed for low quality reads and vector contamination. In addition, we detected and removed 902 SCN transcripts from the obtained sequence data. It is possible that the SCN transcripts could be contaminants from SCN-infected soybean plants (Table 1). After these processes, 37 834 clones (18 670 from GMFL01-set and 19 164 from GMFL02-set) were available for further analyses. We obtained a total of 68 661 EST sequences consisting of 36 512 5′-ESTs and 32 149 3′-ESTs. Both 5′ and 3′ ends of sequences could be assigned for 30 827 clones (14 740 from GMFL01-set and 16 087 from GMFL02-set). However, sequences from only one-side sequence could be detected for remaining 7007 clones. All sequences were tagged with unique clone IDs as GMFL01-XX-YYYF/R or GMFL02-XX-YYYF/R. In this nomenclature system, X and Y refer to plate numbers and well numbers in each plate, respectively. The letters F and R indicate forward or reverse sequences, respectively. All sequences were deposited to DDBJ with the accession numbers BW650749–BW684913 and DB955456–DB990717. Clones which had both read sequences showing significant sequence similarity to known proteins were analyzed to confirm whether they contained initiation codons and poly (A)+ tails. The results suggested that 87.7% of the clones contained entire open reading frames in their inserts.Scheme for construction and data processing of a soybean full-length-enriched cDNA library. We constructed a soybean full-length-enriched cDNA library using a biotinylated CAP-trapper method from multiple sources of soybean plants under various conditions (Table 1). A total of 39 936 cDNA clones (GMFL01 and GMFL02 clone sets) were sequenced and 68 661 both-end sequences were derived. These sequences were deposited to the DDBJ. The sequences were clustered into 22 674 scaffolds. We subsequently selected 4712 clones for full-length cDNA sequences and deposited them to DDBJ.Scheme for construction and data processing of a soybean full-length-enriched cDNA library.

We subsequently selected 4712 clones for full-length cDNA sequences and deposited them to DDBJ.Table 2 summarizes the results from sequence data analysis. The sequences were assembled into 11 036 contigs and 15 255 singletons using CAP3.28 The CAP3 assembly data were able to further clustered, resulting in the construction of 22 674 scaffolds as non-redundant EST sequences. This set of 22 674 scaffolds was then used as a basic material for further analyses. We built a cluster profile representing the number of clones per scaffold (Fig. 2). These data showed that a large number of scaffolds contain a small number of clones, suggesting that the redundancy of soybean cDNA library was relatively low.Distribution of numbers of soybean cDNA clones involved in each cluster of sequence assembly. We derived 68 661 sequences from 39 936 soybean cDNA clones, and clustered them into 22 674 scaffolds.

Sequence assembly performed by CAP3 reveals a large distribution of the numbers of clones per scaffold.Summary of soybean cDNA sequences for assembly and clusteringSummary of soybean cDNA sequences for assembly and clusteringAs described above, our cDNA library contains multiple RNA samples from soybean plants that were grown under various conditions (Table 1). The inclusion of RNA samples from multiple growth conditions is advantageous since it increases the variation of transcripts in the library. For example, it is likely that abiotic stress treatments might enhance the proportion of stress-responsive genes in the library. In addition, several specific tissues, such as developing seeds, flower buds and nodules, might increase tissue-specific genes in our collection.3.3. Full-length sequences of soybean cDNAsIf properly constructed, a full-length-enriched cDNA library should contain a high proportion of full-length cDNA clones and maintain complete coding regions, splicing information and 5′- and 3′-UTR sequences. Thus, the entire sequences of full-length cDNA clones will be extremely informative. Here, we determined 4712 full-read cDNA sequences that were selected from the GMFL01 clone set. The majority of the sequences consist of stress-responsive genes which were identified by a large set of microarray data from soybean plants under drought, salt, cold stresses and ABA treatments (Todaka et al., unpublished results). The microarray was constructed in the format of a 44K custom oligonucleotide microarray (Agillent Technologies, CA, USA) from a data set of soybean full-length cDNAs and a public EST database (Todaka et al., unpublished results). All sequences of full-length cDNAs were deposited to the DDBJ with accession numbers AK243693–AK246134 and AK285150–AK287419.Figure 3 shows length distributions of soybean cDNA inserts and ORFs from 4712 full-length cDNA sequences. The full-length sequences ranged from 413 to 7338 bp, and their average size was 1539 bp. Seki et al. (in RIKEN Plant Science Center) determined full-length sequences of 21 005 RIKEN Arabidopsis Full-Length (RAFL) cDNA clones the average size of RAFL cDNA inserts was estimated to be 1445 bp37 (Seki et al., unpublished results). Although the average size of soybean cDNA inserts was slightly longer than Arabidopsis, it was similar to other plants, e.g. rice and wheat had the average 1.5 kb cDNA inserts.17,38 We then extracted the longest ORFs from those full-length sequences and the average size of soybean ORFs was 1042 bp and the median was 933 bp which was similar to Arabidopsis (1097 bp) or rice (947 bp).38 Since these data were in accordance with those from other published data, we have confidence that our soybean cDNA library successfully captured a wide range of cDNA inserts without any bias. It is likely that our utilization of a phage vector, λFLC, which is optimized to capture long cDNAs23 maximized our chances for construction of the full-length-enriched soybean library.Length distributions of soybean cDNA inserts and ORFs. Sequence length of soybean cDNA inserts (A) and its ORFs (B) was obtained from a total of 4712 full-length sequences of soybean cDNAs. Used definitions and calculation methods were described in the Materials and methods section.Length distributions of soybean cDNA inserts and ORFs. Sequence length of soybean cDNA inserts (A) and its ORFs (B) was obtained from a total of 4712 full-length sequences of soybean cDNAs. Used definitions and calculation methods were described in the Materials and methods section.The 4712 full-length cDNA sequences were classified into eukaryotic clusters of orthologous groups of proteins (KOGs) in Fig. 4. KOGs include proteins from seven eukaryotic genomes:33,34 three animals (Caenorhabditis elegans, Drosophila melanogaster and Homo sapiens), one plant (Arabidopsis thaliana), two fungi (Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Schizosaccharomyces pombe) and an intracellular microsporidian parasite (Encephalitozoon cuniculi). Of these, 3015 (64.0%) were assigned to KOGs by BLASTX (e-value <1e–5). This result may represent the functional classification of abiotic stress-responsive genes in soybean, because the majority of 4712 clones were selected from microarray analysis using soybean plants under drought, salt, cold stresses and ABA treatments as described above. However, Fig. 4B shows that the proportion of each KOG subcategory was similar between 22 674 scaffolds and 4712 full-length cDNA clones. Further analysis is necessary to discuss an expression profile of soybean stress-responsive genes in which signal transduction and metabolic pathways should be activated for cellular responses to abiotic stress.39 On the whole, the distribution of the functional classification of all scaffolds built by our collected soybean genes was comparable with those identified from a similar study performed with a collection of Populus nigra.16Functional annotation of soybean genes. The 22 674 scaffolds (A) and 4712 full-length sequences (B) of soybean cDNAs were classified into functional groups by the KOG database.44 The colors of each functional group are indicated in the table. Graphs are outlined with multi-color frames which represent four subcategories: ‘information storage and processing’ (light red), ‘cellular processing and signaling’ (bright yellow), ‘metabolism’ (greenish brown) and ‘poorly characterized’ (pink).Functional annotation of soybean genes.

We then compared a total of 6570 full-length sequences with known soybean mRNA sequences containing CDSs that were reported in GenBank as of July 2007. As a result, we found that 5898 sequences were assigned as new full-length sequences of soybean cDNAs. We will continue further sequencing of other full-length cDNAs of our collection in an attempt to identify additional novel full-length sequences.3.4. Comparative analysis with other plantsBy using the BLAST program,40 soybean cDNA sequences were compared with other plants, Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza sativa (rice), Populus trichocarpa (poplar), L. japonicus and M. truncatula (Table 3). The data query was 22 674 non-redundant soybean sequences (scaffolds) derived from 5′ and 3′ ends of soybean cDNA clones. Data subjects were 31 921, 40 041 and 45 555 gene sets of Arabidopsis, rice and poplar, respectively (Table 4). The result revealed that 21 047, 19 969 and 21 277 of soybean cDNA clones showed homology to Arabidopsis, rice and poplar sequences (BLASTX e-value <1e−5). We found that 1194 scaffolds (5.3%) did not match with Arabidopsis, rice and poplar sequences. Comparative analyses between soybean and L. japonicus or M. truncatula should be able to confirm whether the 1194 sequences contain legume-specific or soybean-specific genes. However, we found that a large number of soybean sequences did not match with the other legume sequence data sets. This lack of matching probably occurred since the data sets for other legume models have not yet been saturated, e.g. 148 457 records of L. japonicus and 232 299 records of M. truncatula primarily consisting of ESTs. This problem can be solved in the future when the genomic information is accumulated for soybean, L. japonicus or M. truncatula. As a result of the comparative analyses, we detected 1085 sequences (4.8%) that did not match with all data subjects (Table 3). Among them, 520 sequences correspond to soybean ESTs and these sequences were therefore identified as true soybean-specific genes. The 520 sequences were submitted to InterPro to obtain functional domain information from soybean-specific genes (Table 5). InterPro is a database of protein families, domains and functional sites in which identifiable features found in known proteins can be applied to unknown protein sequences.36 Among them, 64 sequences were assigned to InterPro ID. The results showed that the total and non-redundant number of InterPro IDs were 66 and 27, respectively. The InterPro ID analysis indicated that the majority of soybean-specific sequences could be assigned to some legume-specific proteins, for example, nodulins and trypsin inhibitors, etc.Comparative analysis of cDNAs between soybean and other plantsSoybean full-length cDNA sequences from 22 674 scaffolds were submitted to BLASTX search (e-value <1e− 5) against data sets of Arabidopsis thaliana (Ath), rice (Osa) or poplar (Ptr), or BLASTN search (e-value <1e− 30) against data sets of L. japonicus (Lja) or M. truncatula (Mtr).

The average lengths of 5′-UTR and 3′-UTR were 123.13 bp (standard variation ± 123.31) and 247.52 bp (±108.14), and the median lengths were 75 and 233 bp, respectively (Fig. 5). In Arabidopsis or rice, it was reported that the median lengths of 5′-UTR were 82–88 and 123 bp, respectively 38. This indicates that 5′-UTR length of soybean was similar to that of Arabidopsis rather than that of rice. It is reasonable because both soybean and Arabidopsis belong to dicot plants, whereas rice is monocot. Although the detailed reason for this similarity is not known at this time, future comparative studies with additional plants should address whether such shorter 5′-UTR regions are specific to soybean, legumes or dicots.Length distributions of 5′- and 3′-UTR sequences of soybean cDNA clones. The 5′-UTR (A) and 3′-UTR sequences (B) were derived from 68 661 soybean EST sequences. The definitions and calculation methods were described in the Materials and methods section.Length distributions of 5′- and 3′-UTR sequences of soybean cDNA clones. The 5′-UTR (A) and 3′-UTR sequences (B) were derived from 68 661 soybean EST sequences. The definitions and calculation methods were described in the Materials and methods section.As a means to identify novel transcripts from our cDNA clones, we compared the 22 674 soybean sequences with known soybean sequences in GenBank to identify new transcripts in our clones. As of July 2007, the GenBank database contains 386 196 records of the soybean nucleotide sequences (ESTs and mRNAs). Subsequent to our sequence analysis, we found that 3022 scaffolds did not match with soybean sequences. As a result, they were regarded as new soybean transcripts. These data also suggest that the soybean full-length cDNA library captures a wide variety of transcripts with relatively low redundancy. In general, redundancy in a cDNA library can be reduced incorporating the normalization processes.41 Although our library was not normalized, it successfully produced a large number of cDNAs (93% of soybean UniGene set), suggesting that it should be a good source for obtaining information from non-redundant soybean cDNAs. Various RNA samples, as shown in Table 1, might extend the variation of transcripts in the soybean full-length-enriched library.3.5. The value of the soybean full-length-enriched cDNA library and the full-length cDNA collectionWe report here a large number of sequences of soybean cDNAs, and the majority of them contain CDS. The value of this information is expected to increase when it is integrated to whole-genome sequence of soybean. For example, 5′-UTR data in full-length cDNA sequences will help to identify the promoter sequences, or full-length sequences will allow us to outlook for gene structures of paralogs or gene families which resemble each other in soybean genome. Actually, we compared our cDNA sequence data (22 674 scaffolds) with predicted 62 199 transcripts from the soybean draft genome (JGI-DOE; http://www.phytozome.net/soybean), but 20.2% of cDNA sequences showed low similarity. Also, we analyzed a public data set of soybean transcripts (Ver.2 2006-09-28 release, 116 965 data from TIGR Plant Transcript Assemblies DB;42http://plantta.tigr.org/), and we found that 16.0% of TIGR’s data showed low similarity to the predicted transcripts. These results indicate that the prediction of soybean gene structures is still incomplete now, and our cDNA collection will be a great help for annotation of soybean genome data.Another effective approach using full-length cDNAs is to analyze gene functions and structures. First, the utilization of full-length cDNAs enables us to demonstrate an expression pattern of single transcript in detail. This is possible because a full-length cDNA represents a single splice variant from each transcription unit. Secondly, they are easy to use for a gene transfer system and lead us toward better understanding of gene functions through gain-of-function or loss-of-function analyses. Recently, a large-scale screening system of transgenic plants using full-length cDNA clones and agrobacterium-mediated transformation had been established, i.e. the FOX-hunting system (Full-length cDNA Over-eXpressing gene hunting system) enables us to survey a lot of gene functions within a short period43. In addition, it will be useful for constructing a microarray on which specific oligonucleotide probes for each soybean cDNA clones are printed and the system clearly demonstrated a transcriptome in soybean (Todaka et al., unpublished results).Our information from soybean full-length cDNA clones could also be useful for generating molecular markers. First, SSCP or CAPS markers can be developed by PCR based on 5′- and 3′-sequences of cDNA clones. Furthermore, full-read cDNA sequences are likely to be an important material for finding SNP or SSR markers. Actually, the development of molecular markers has already been conducted by using our soybean full-length cDNA collection (Dr K. Harada, personal communication). Our collection will be also useful for comparative genomics such as synteny analysis of soybean and other plants, for example, L. japonicus. Now we have a lot of information of genomic resources from soybean and L. japonicus, which will provide us various opportunities to accelerate understanding of legume systems.Here we reported on the soybean full-length cDNA resource which will be arranged and maintained by each cDNA clone. We also developed a web-based interface of the soybean full-length cDNA database which will enable researchers to gain easy access to the data (http://rsoy.psc.riken.jp/). The website contains a BLAST program which allows a search of soybean full-length cDNA clones based on sequence similarity, as well as a keyword search against gene functions or annotations (Fig. 6). The information and resources of the soybean full-length cDNA clones will be distributed from the National Bioresource Project for Lotus/Glycine in Japan (http://www.legumebase.agr.miyazaki-u.ac.jp/). As described above, full-length cDNAs are high potential resources because they can provide various outputs for post-genomic life sciences. We hope that the soybean full-length cDNA collection will be useful in various situations of legume research.The web-based interface to the soybean full-length cDNA database.

IntroductionThe completed genome sequences of rice1 (Oryza sativa) and Arabidopsis2 (Arabidopsis thaliana) constitute a valuable resource for comparative genomic analysis, as they are representatives of the two major evolutionary lineages within the angiosperms: the monocotyledons and the dicotyledons. The divergence in codon usage patterns between rice and Arabidopsis genes has occurred since the evolutionary divergence of the dicots and monocots ∼200 million years (My) ago, with increment in GC content of some rice genes.3,4 The large scale variation in DNA base composition due to increment of GC revealed two gene classes, namely GC-rich and GC-poor in monocots, but not in dicots.5–8 It is estimated that codon usage variation in monocots is mainly determined by spatial arrangement of genomic G + C-content, i.e. the isochore structure similar to mammals.9 The biased gene distribution in the rice genome raised a question about the distribution of tissue-specific and widely expressed genes according to the GC level of the isochores. Several studies indicated that the distribution of widely expressed genes in human is not correlated with GC levels of isochores.10–13 However, Lercher et al.14 reported that there is a strong correlation between gene expression breadth and GC content in human, suggesting that there might be selective pressure favoring the concentration of housekeeping genes in GC-rich isochors. Evolutionary studies on housekeeping and tissue-specific genes in mammalian genome have recently gained much more interest.15–18 Working on codon usage of tissue-specific genes in human, interestingly, Plotkin et al.19 reported that there is a significant difference in synonymous codon usage between genes specifically expressed in different human tissues. The results suggest that selective constraint acts on synonymous codon usage to optimize translation by adapting to the pool of tRNAs available in each tissue for tissue-specific genes in human.19 However, Semon et al.20 by analyzing 2126 human tissue-specific genes expressed in 18 libraries demonstrated that there is no evidence for tissue-specific adaptation of synonymous codon usage in human.Conversely, all the previous studies on housekeeping and tissue-specific genes have been done on human genome. Rice which is heterogeneous in base composition similar to human has not been explored till date. Rice–Arabidopsis pair is a well-known model to study codon usage divergence in plants.4,21 Availability of whole genome expression data for both rice and Arabidopsis has made it possible to examine the pattern of evolutionary forces shaping codon usage in housekeeping and tissue-specific genes of these two plants. In the present study, we have traced the pattern of evolutionary forces shaping codon usage in both housekeeping and tissue-specific genes of rice and Arabidopsis and discussed the presence of contrasting selective constraint affecting the evolution of these sets of genes.2. Materials and methods2.1. Sequence dataThe genomes of rice and Arabidopsis were downloaded, respectively, from RiceGAAS Rice Genome Automated Annotation System ftp://ftp.dna.affrc.go.jp/pub/RiceGAAS/current/ and Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) http://www.arabidopsis.org/. All sequences having <100 codons were ignored from our data set. Also, genes containing internal stop codons were removed and thus data set comprising a total of 18 658 rice genes was taken for further analysis.Homologous genes between rice and Arabidopsis genomes were identified using gapped BLASTP searches using cut-off expects of 10.0 × 10−6.22 Pairs of coding sequences which have at least 30% amino acids positives and overlaps over at least 80% of their length were retained for the analysis. The maximum gap size allowed between a pair of sequence is 5%. Owing to presence of much multi-copy genes both in Arabidopsis and rice, some sequences from one species showed high levels of sequence similarity with more than one sequence from the other species. In those cases, the sequence pairs that produced higher degree of sequence similarity were retained.23 We also eliminated pseudo genes and mitochondrial protein from the homologous gene set. Finally, our data set consists of 4065 homologous gene pairs (Supplementary Table S1 contains rice–Arabidopsis homologous genes pairs).2.2. Expression profileThe public domain MPSS (massively parallel signature sequencing) expression data for rice24 (http://mpss.udel.edu/rice/) and Arabidopsis25 (http://mpss.udel.edu/at/) present more accurate estimation of gene transcript levels and are easily accessible.25 The expression level of a gene expressed in a single library is estimated by counting the number of individual 17-base signature sequences representing each gene.26 It should be noted that current MPSS data set for rice is based on the TIGR rice genome annotation. We retrieved expression level of individual rice genes with RiceGAAS ID using Rice MPSS: Query by Sequence tool that basically extract all possible tags from the sequence and compare them against their database. The expression levels of a gene expressed in different expression libraries were estimated by calculating average expression values in all libraries considered (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 contain library information). We sorted the expression values in each library in an ascending order, and then divided them into five groups, each containing 20% of the population.26 Individual genes were assigned an expression rank from 1 (low expression) to 5 (high expression) according to the increase in average expression level.We assigned housekeeping and tissue-specific genes by sorting our data set (4065 rice–Arabidopsis homologous genes) according to increase in τ value and taking out genes from extreme 20% of population from both ends. Using the above criteria, we obtained 787 housekeeping and 770 tissue-specific genes. All our analysis were performed using 787 housekeeping and 770 tissue-specific genes of rice with its corresponding counterpart in Arabidopsis (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5 contain rice–Arabidopsis housekeeping and tissue-specific homologous gene-pairs).2.3. Sequence analysisPair-wise synonymous (Ks) and non-synonymous (Ka) distance between the homologous genes of rice and Arabidopsis was calculated by using the method of Yang and Neilsen.29The genetic robustness at codon level has been measured using CUB available at http://users.ox.ac.uk/~zool0643/codon/CUB.html.30 According to this method proposed by Archetti, we have measured dissimilarity (DAA/AA*) between original (AA) and mutant amino acid (AA*) for each synonymous codon based on the McLachlan’s matrix of chemical similarity.31 Dissimilarity of a single amino acid (AA) is given by: DAA/AA*=ωAA/AA −ωAA/AA*, where ωAA/AA is the similarity of the amino acid AA to itself and ωAA/AA* is the similarity of AA to the mutant amino acid AA* obtained after an error at one of the positions of the original codon. Since ωAA/AA>ωAA/AA* for every amino acid, DAA/AA* is always positive, and since there are three possible mutants for each position, there are nine possible measures of DAA/AA* for each codon, corresponding to nine possible mutant codons. Their mean value is taken as a measure of distance (dissimilarity) between the original codon and its possible mutants. This mean value of dissimilarity is the measure of mean distance (MD) for each codon to its possible mutants. To calculate the degree of error minimization of a coding sequence, the correlation between the MD values and the corresponding relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) is calculated for each synonymous family. If N is the number of degenerate synonymous codon families on which the correlation is calculated, and R is the sum of the correlations, the degree of error minimization is measured by RN = R/N (RN ranging between −1 and +1). The RN measures genetic robustness with the assumption that all the amino acids are weighted equally, irrespective of their frequency on the protein. If the value of each correlation is weighted (multiplied) by the frequency of the corresponding amino acid, then the measure is denoted by wRN. Since MD is a measure of dissimilarity, the lower the value of RN and wRN, the higher the degree of error minimization.The Zipfold program was used to predict free-folding energies for each native mRNA sequence available at http://dinamelt.bioinfo.rpi.edu/zipfold.php.The transfer RNA gene copy number necessary to determine the major codons32 for each amino acid in rice were taken from Xiyin et al.33 and tRNA copy number for Arabidopsis was taken from http://lowelab.ucsc.edu/GtRNAdb/Athal/.The Student’s t-test was used to evaluate the significance of all the pair-wise differences. The statistical tests were performed using the SPSS (13.0) package.3. Results and discussion3.1. Influence of expression level in modulating synonymous substitution rates for both housekeeping and tissue-specific genes in riceAnalysis of synonymous substitution patterns (Ks) between rice and Arabidopsis homologous genes pairs for both housekeeping and tissue-specific classes reveals that housekeeping genes are under stronger selective constraint as observed from their significantly lower average synonymous substitution rates (Ks = 3.27) (P < 0.001) when compared with tissue-specific genes (Ks = 3.45). Similar trend in evolutionary rates have been observed in earlier studies on mammalian genome.15–17 It has already been demonstrated that housekeeping and tissue-specific genes comprise of both highly and lowly expressed genes.18 In order to investigate the influence of expression level in modulating synonymous substitution rates of housekeeping and tissue-specific genes in rice, we measured synonymous substitution rates for highly and lowly expressed genes of both housekeeping and tissue-specific classes (Table 1). From the Table 1, it is obvious that synonymous substitution rate of highly expressed housekeeping genes (Ks = 3.12) is significantly (P < 0.001) lower than that of highly expressed tissue-specific genes (Ks = 3.74). In contrast, there is no significant difference in average synonymous substitution rate between lowly expressed housekeeping (Ks = 3.34) and lowly expressed tissue-specific genes (Ks = 3.41) (Table 1). The results imply that in rice genome selective constraint shaping synonymous codon usage of highly expressed genes varies depending on whether they belong to housekeeping or tissue-specific genes. Non-significant difference in average synonymous substitution rate between lowly expressed housekeeping and tissue-specific genes suggest that lowly expressed genes have been conserved during divergence between rice and Arabidopsis. However, while comparing synonymous substitution rates between highly and lowly expressed tissue-specific and housekeeping genes, an unusual trend have been observed. In housekeeping genes (Table 1), we observed significantly lowered synonymous substitution rate in highly expressed genes (Ks = 3.12) (P < 0.05) (number of genes = 209) than lowly expressed genes (Ks = 3.34) (number of genes = 203). Interestingly, in tissue-specific genes of rice (Table 1), the average synonymous substitution rates were significantly lower in lowly expressed genes (Ks = 3.41) (P < 0.005) (number of genes = 512) when compared with highly expressed genes (Ks = 3.74) (number of genes = 99). It has been shown in previous studies that the synonymous substitution rate between Escherichia coli and Salmonella typhimurium is lower in highly than in weakly expressed genes, and it has been suggested that this is due to stronger selection for translational efficiency in highly expressed genes.34 Recently, Drummond et al.,35 working on yeast, demonstrated that expression level governs the rate of synonymous substitution and protein sequence evolution. In rice tissue-specific genes, our data suggest that high expression does not necessarily lead to lower synonymous substitution rates when compared with low expression. However, this also prompts us to explore relationship between expression level and translation selection for both housekeeping and tissue-specific genes in plants. Possibly, there may be some other selective force determining the synonymous substitution rate of highly expressed tissue-specific genes in rice.Average values of synonymous substitution rates for housekeeping and tissue-specific classes of genes in highly expressed (HEG) and lowly expressed genes (LEG) of riceLevel of significance (a) indicates significance of the difference between highly (HEG) and lowly (LEG) expressed housekeeping and tissue-specific genes of rice.Level of significance (b) indicates significance of the difference between highly (HEG) expressed housekeeping and tissue-specific genes of rice and lowly (LEG) expressed housekeeping and tissue-specific genes of rice.NS indicates not-significant.Average values of synonymous substitution rates for housekeeping and tissue-specific classes of genes in highly expressed (HEG) and lowly expressed genes (LEG) of riceLevel of significance (a) indicates significance of the difference between highly (HEG) and lowly (LEG) expressed housekeeping and tissue-specific genes of rice.Level of significance (b) indicates significance of the difference between highly (HEG) expressed housekeeping and tissue-specific genes of rice and lowly (LEG) expressed housekeeping and tissue-specific genes of rice.NS indicates not-significant.3.2. Co-adaptation of synonymous codon usage with the tRNA pool of housekeeping and tissue-specific homologous genes in rice and in ArabidopsisIn an attempt to investigate the nature of selective constraint shaping synonymous codon usage of housekeeping and tissue-specific genes, we analyzed preferred codons in both the gene classes of rice (Table 2) and Arabidopsis (Table 3). Preferred codons are those that generally correspond to the most abundant tRNA species and they provide fitness benefits to highly expressed genes by enhancing translational efficiency.36 The co-adaptation of tRNA content and codon usage for the optimal translation of highly expressed genes is well known in Caenorhabditis elegans.37 To test translational selection in rice and Arabidopsis genome, we have identified those codons in both housekeeping and tissue-specific gene classes whose RSCU values are significantly higher in highly expressed genes than lowly expressed genes. We then investigated the correspondence between codon preferences in highly expressed genes and tRNA gene copy number in both rice and Arabidopsis. We obtained ten preferred codons in both housekeeping and tissue-specific gene classes (Table 2) in rice. We even considered revised wobble rules for eukaryotic genomes to estimate preferred codons in highly expressed housekeeping and tissue-specific genes.38 These rules assume that GNN tRNAs pair with both C-ending and U-ending codons, whereas ANN tRNA genes are modified to inosine and decode both U-ending and G-ending codons. Following revised wobble rule, we observed 14 preferred codons in housekeeping rice genes. Similarly, in tissue-specific rice genes, there are 16 preferred codons that correspond to most abundant tRNA copy number. Our result indicates that translational selection driven by tRNA copy number to optimize synonymous codon usage of highly expressed genes equally influences both housekeeping and tissue-specific genes in rice which does not corroborate with unexpected lowering (Table 2) of synonymous substitution rates in lowly expressed tissue-specific genes. Same analysis was performed in Arabidopsis and it has been observed that in housekeeping genes, there are 10 codons that correspond to most abundant tRNA copy number, whereas in tissue-specific genes, there are only five codons that show perfect match with most abundant tRNA copy number (Table 3). However, after following revised wobble rules for eukaryotic genomes,38 we obtained 17 codons in housekeeping genes that correspond to most abundant tRNA copy number, whereas in tissue-specific class, we observed only eight preferred codons that correspond to most abundant tRNA copy number (Table 3). Therefore, in Arabidopsis translational selection driven by tRNA copy number to optimize synonymous codon usage of highly expressed genes has a greater influence in housekeeping Arabidopsis genes.RSCU values of highly expressed (HEG) and lowly expressed (LEG) housekeeping and tissue-specific genes in riceRSCU values within parenthesis represent tissue-specific genes of rice, and the values outside represent housekeeping rice genes.

Selective constraint acting on mRNA secondary structure is responsible for regulating synonymous substitution rates in rice tissue-specific genesIt has already been demonstrated that there is a selection for local RNA secondary structures in coding regions and this nucleic acid structure resembles the folding profiles of the coded proteins.39 Further, it has been observed in E. coli the decrease of the stability of mRNA structure contributes to the increase of mRNA expression40 suggesting possible relationships between synonymous codon usage and presence of some constraints upon mRNA secondary structure that subsequently regulate the gene expression levels. A significant increase (P < 0.005) of average mRNA folding energy was observed only in highly expressed tissue-specific genes, whereas there is no significant difference of mRNA folding energy between highly and lowly expressed housekeeping genes in rice. In order to determine whether selection acts on mRNA secondary structure to modulate synonymous substitution rates of tissue-specific genes, we performed correlation analysis between synonymous substitution rates of each gene with its corresponding mRNA folding energy. A significant strong positive correlation (Rs = 0.307, P < 0.001) indicates constraints on mRNA secondary structure influencing synonymous substitution rates in tissue-specific class of genes in rice. Thus, the influence of constraints acting on mRNA secondary structure modulates synonymous substitution rates in rice tissue-specific genes.3.4. Mutational bias regulates error minimization in both rice and Arabidopsis homologous setIt is clear from our result that selective constraint shaping synonymous codon usage has taken a different turn in both housekeeping and tissue-specific highly expressed genes. Therefore, it is quite interesting to explore evolutionary forces acting on synonymous codon usage to optimize error minimization capacity of highly expressed housekeeping and tissue-specific genes in both the plants. The evolution of genetic code took place in such a way so that it can minimize errors due to mutation and mistranslation. The theory of error minimization for the evolution of genetic codes postulates that the codons are arranged in such a way that reduces errors.41,42 Thus synonymous codons differ in their capacity to minimize the effects of errors due to mutation or mistranslation. In Drosophila melanogaster, the degree of error minimization is correlated with the degree of codon usage bias.43 Later, it was reported that the codon usage pattern of highly expressed genes in E. coli has been selected in such a way that mistranslation would have the minimum possible effects on the structure and function of the related proteins. Furthermore, according to Najafabadi et al.44 frequencies of codons in highly expressed genes that correspond to most abundant tRNA copy number may have been under selection pressure for error minimization. For rice genome, we have calculated the error minimization capacity (wRn) of housekeeping and tissue-specific genes. We observed significant lowering of wRn (P < 0.001) for housekeeping genes (wRn = −0.3322) with respect to tissue-specific genes (wRn = −0.2458). This result indicates the presence of stronger selective constraint on codon usage of housekeeping genes to achieve greater degree of error minimization capacity. We compared wRn between highly and lowly expressed genes of housekeeping and tissue-specific categories of rice genome (Table 4). We observed significantly (P < 0.001) greater error minimizing capacity for highly expressed housekeeping genes than lowly expressed housekeeping genes. Surprisingly, in tissue-specific genes, we observed no significant difference of error minimization between highly and lowly expressed genes in rice. Thus, selection on codon usage for error minimization has hardly had any role in distinguishing highly and lowly expressed tissue-specific genes. Our observations for housekeeping genes are in consistent with the previous findings that highly expressed genes are those having a strong preference for codons to minimize the effect of errors by mutation and mistranslation.30,44–47 We also performed the same analysis for Arabidopsis genes and observed that highly expressed genes in both housekeeping and tissue-specific categories have significantly (P < 0.001) greater error minimizing capacity than lowly expressed genes (Table 5). Therefore, selection acting on synonymous codon usage to optimize error minimization capacity of highly expressed genes equally influences both housekeeping and tissue-specific homologous genes of Arabidopsis. However, it is noteworthy that there is no significant difference in error minimizing capacity between highly expressed housekeeping and tissue-specific Arabidopsis genes. This discrepancy between translational selection driven by tRNA copy number and genetic robustness in both plants indicate that error minimizing capacity of highly expressed genes does not depend on selection based on tRNA abundance for both rice and Arabidopsis as observed in E. coli.44,45 It is reasonable to assume from our results that frequencies of codons in highly expressed genes that correspond to most abundant tRNA copy number may not be under selection pressure for error minimization.Average error minimization values (wRn) of housekeeping and tissue-specific classes of genes in highly expressed (HEG) and lowly expressed genes (LEG) of riceLevel of significance between highly expressed (HEG) and lowly expressed (LEG) housekeeping and tissue-specific genes of rice is shown.

In order to investigate if observed pattern of error minimization in rice and Arabidopsis is due to mutational bias, we measured GC3 level for both highly and lowly expressed homologous genes of housekeeping and tissue-specific genes in rice and Arabidopsis. A significant difference in average GC3 (P < 0.001) level has been observed between highly and lowly expressed genes of both housekeeping and tissue-specific homologous genes of Arabidopsis (Table 6). Correlation analysis was performed between GC content and error minimization capacity of both housekeeping and tissue-specific genes of Arabidopsis. A significant strong negative correlation has been observed between error minimization capacity and GC content of both housekeeping (Rs = −0.541, P < 0.001) and tissue-specific genes (Rs = −0.499, P < 0.001) in Arabidopsis (Supplementary Tables S6–S9 contain Arabidopsis housekeeping and tissue-specific homologous genes and their corresponding GC3 and error minimization values). However, in rice, there is no significant difference of GC3 between highly and lowly expressed tissue-specific genes (Table 7). Rather, we observed a significant difference in average GC3 level only between highly and lowly expressed housekeeping genes in rice (Table 7). There is a significant (P < 0.001) increment of GC content in highly expressed housekeeping genes of rice genome; consistent with this, we found that synonymous substitution rate of GC-rich rice housekeeping genes (Ks = 2.54) is significantly (P < 0.001) lower than GC-poor housekeeping genes (Ks = 3.63). In addition, it has been further estimated that the synonymous substitution rate (Ks) is negatively correlated (Rs = −0.216, P < 0.01) with GC content at third codon position in housekeeping set of genes in rice. The result suggests that increment of GC in highly expressed housekeeping genes is under selection to optimize synonymous substitution rates.Average GC3 values for housekeeping and tissue-specific classes of genes in highly expressed (HEG) and lowly expressed genes (LEG) of ArabidopsisLevel of significance between highly expressed (HEG) and lowly expressed (LEG) housekeeping and tissue-specific genes of Arabidopsis is shown.Average GC3 values for housekeeping and tissue-specific classes of genes in highly expressed (HEG) and lowly expressed genes (LEG) of ArabidopsisLevel of significance between highly expressed (HEG) and lowly expressed (LEG) housekeeping and tissue-specific genes of Arabidopsis is shown.Average GC3 values for housekeeping and tissue-specific classes of genes in highly expressed (HEG) and lowly expressed genes (LEG) of riceLevel of significance between highly expressed (HEG) and lowly expressed (LEG) housekeeping and tissue-specific genes of rice is shown.

NS indicates average values of GC3 not significant between highly and lowly expressed tissue-specific genes of rice.Correlation analysis was again performed between GC content and error minimization capacity of housekeeping genes in rice. A significant strong negative correlation (Rs = −0.606, P < 0.001) has been observed between error minimization capacity and GC content of housekeeping genes in rice. These lead us to conclude that in plants it is the mutational bias that regulates error minimization of highly expressed genes.3.5. ConclusionIn this work, we studied how selective constraint shape synonymous codon usage of housekeeping and tissue-specific homologous genes in both rice and Arabidopsis. We observed that there is difference in codon usage pattern between housekeeping and tissue-specific genes in both rice and Arabidopsis genes. Although, previous studies on Drosophila and rodents favor selectionist model for error minimization at protein level,30 we demonstrated that mutational bias is responsible for the observed pattern of error minimization. We argue that error minimization at protein level has taken a different turn after the divergence of plants and animals. Moreover, our results show that housekeeping genes are under stronger selective constraint than that of the tissue-specific genes. Translational selection driven by tRNA copy number is responsible for optimizing codon usage variation in housekeeping genes. On the contrary, in housekeeping genes, selection acting on mRNA secondary structural stability of tissue-specific genes has a greater influence to modulate codon usage variation. Lavner and Kotlar48 argued that selection may act on codon bias to reduce elongation rate by favoring non-optimal codons in lowly expressed genes. In the present study, influence of mRNA secondary structural stability on codon usage variation of tissue-specific genes might be the consequence of favoring non-optimal codons in lowly expressed tissue-specific genes. Thus, our study unambiguously suggests that two sets of genes in rice and Arabidopsis (housekeeping and tissue specific) have evolved under contrasting evolutionary constraints.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingAuthors are thankful to Department of Biotechnology, Government of India for financial help.Authors are also thankful to Dr Nakai Kenta and two anonymous reviewers for their fruitful constructive comments in improving the manuscript.Supplementary data"

IntroductionMost amino acids are encoded by more than one codon, and these synonymous codons usually differ by one nucleotide in the third position. Generally, alternative synonymous codons are not used with equal frequency; their usage varies among different species, and often among genes within the same genome.1 Three principal factors have been proposed to account for the intragenomic variation in synonymous codon usage. First, intragenomic variation in G + C content is mostly related to the existence of regions with unusual base composition, so-called genomic islands, that may be the result of recent horizontal DNA transfer.2–4 Secondly, the excess of G over C in the leading strand of DNA replication relative to the lagging strand is observed in many bacteria, and this is thought to reflect strand-specific mutational bias.5,6 Thirdly, genes expressed at high levels in fast-growing bacteria tend to preferentially use translationally optimal codons that are recognized by the most abundant tRNAs. This presumably reflects natural selection for synonymous codons that are translated more efficiently and accurately.7,8 Thus, the use of synonymous codons in any gene can be the result of a mixture of these different evolutionary factors, and their relative contributions may vary among different species depending on their life history.9–11 It follows that information on synonymous codon usage can be used to identify certain kinds of genes, e.g. those that have been horizontally transferred12–14 or are highly expressed.15–18To reliably detect and quantify synonymous codon usage patterns, it is necessary to employ appropriate statistical methods. One such method is correspondence analysis (CA), a multivariate statistical method that can be used to summarize high dimensional data, such as codon counts, by reducing them to a limited number of variables, called axes.19,20 The axes retain much of the information about the variability in codon usage among the genes, but in a way that makes those differences easier to understand. This method is widely used to identify major sources of variation in synonymous codon usage among genes.A common issue in synonymous codon usage analysis is that variation in amino acid composition among proteins is a confounding factor in assessing variation in synonymous codon usage among nucleotide sequences. Different approaches have been taken to remove such amino acid composition effects. Most commonly, CA is performed on modified codon usage data that have been adjusted for the frequency of the amino acids they encode. The resulting relative codon frequency (RF) and relative synonymous codon usage (RSCU) are used instead of the original codon count data, which is also referred to as the absolute codon frequency (AF). However, previous studies showed that for some genomes the use of RF and RSCU to remove amino acid composition effects introduced a bias associated with the low frequency of cysteine in proteins.21,22 To validate findings, some researchers compared the results of CA using different input data (termed here CA-AF, CA-RF, and CA-RSCU).21,23,24 The within-group CA (WCA) has been proposed as an alternative method to dissociate the effects of different amino acid compositions from the effects directly related to synonymous codon usage.25 This method adjusts the value for each codon by the average value of all the codons encoding for the same amino acid using a different method than CA-RF or CA-RSCU. These four different CA methods have all been used for studying synonymous codon usage, but it remains unclear which one is the most effective. In spite of the lack of rigorous testing, CA-RSCU remains the most popular method.26–37In this paper, we have evaluated and compared four CA methods for the analysis of synonymous codon usage (CA-AF, CA-RF, CA-RSCU and WCA) by applying them to 241 bacterial genomes for which complete genome sequences were available. Our results indicate that WCA is more effective than the other three methods in generating axes corresponding to variation in synonymous codon usage.2. Materials and methods2.1. SequencesComplete genome sequences of bacterial species in GenBank format38 were retrieved from the NCBI FTP site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria). In the case of species for which multiple strains have been sequenced, only one representative was randomly selected. An exception was made for the genomes of the following 10 strains, which were specifically selected as species representatives because they have been previously analyzed by CA: Borrelia burgdorferi B31 (B. burgdorferi B31),21,39,40Chlamydia trachomatis D/UW-3/CX (C. trachomatis D/UW-3/CX),41Clostridium perfringens 13 (C. perfringens 13),42Escherichia coli K12 MG1655 (E. coli K12 MG1655),21,23,43Haemophilus influenzae Rd KW20 (H. influenzae Rd KW20),44Helicobacter pylori 26695 (H. pylori 26695),45Mycoplasma genitalium G37 (M. genitalium G37),21,46Rickettsia prowazekii Madrid E (R. prowazekii Madrid E),47Thermotoga maritima MSB8 (T. maritima MSB8)22 and Treponema pallidum Nichols (T. pallidum Nichols).39 Moreover, genomes were excluded when genes used in the analysis (Section 2.4) were missing. The final data set included 241 genomes (see Supplementary Table S1 or S2 for a comprehensive list). All protein-coding sequences, except those containing letters other than A, C, G, or T were included in the analysis. Because methionine and tryptophan are generally encoded by only a single codon, the codons for methionine and tryptophan were excluded. Start and stop codons were also eliminated.2.2. Definitions of codon usage data2.3. Implementation of CACA was implemented using the ‘dudi.coa’ and ‘within’ functions in the ‘ade4’50 library of R.51 CA takes multivariate data and combines them into a small number of variables (axes) that explains most of the variation among the original variables.19,21,25 In our study our variables are the 59 codons for each gene in a genome, and the result of the CA yields the coordinates of each gene on each new axis. A matrix is created in which the rows correspond to the genes on one bacterial genome and the columns to the 59 codons, such that each row has the codon usage information for a specific gene. For the different CA methods, CA-AF, CA-RF, CA-RSCU, or WCA, the cells contain AF, RF, RSCU, or AF values, respectively, for each gene and codon.We provide a brief explanation of our implementation of CA for analyzing synonymous codon usage. For each genome, the matrix X = [xij] is an input data table with N genes (rows) and 59 codons (columns). We denote the sum of values for the ith gene of X as xi+ and the jth codon as x+j. We denote the sum of all of the data in X as x++. The weight of the ith gene is defined as pi+ = xi+/x++, that of the jth codon is defined as p+j = x+j/x++. The matrix Y has elements  where pij is the weight of each cell pij = xij/x++. The matrix Y for WCA is obtained by replacing the elements yij in the matrix Y for CA-AF by ⁠, where the sum extends over all codons j encoding amino acid a. This subtraction centers the data in each cell based upon the value of the codons that encode a particular amino acid. In other words, the yij values for WCA become the difference between the yij values for CA-AF and their adjusted average.The gik scores are the values that are correlated with other gene features in the subsequent analyses (see Section 2.4).The contribution of the jth codon to the kth axis is given by ⁠. The sum of the contributions of all 59 codons to each axis is one; that is, ⁠. We compared the sum of the contributions of 18 codons with twofold degeneracy (those coding for asparagine, aspartic acid, cysteine, glutamic acid, glutamine, histidine, lysine, phenylalanine, and tyrosine) and the sum of the contributions of 18 codons with sixfold degeneracy (those coding arginine, leucine, and serine).Supplementary Table S1 shows the percentage of total variance explained by the first 10 axes, as generated by these four CA methods for 241 bacterial genomes. Because the percentage of variance explained by axes >3 was small overall, our subsequent analyses were focused on the first three axes.2.4. Interpretation of axes generated by CATo identify major sources of variation among genes on the axes generated by CA of codon usage data, we conducted two analyses that considered four commonly used features of protein-coding genes: GRAVY, GC3content, GC3skew, and Expression.22,52 First, we tested for the correlation between scores of each of three axes [Equation (4)] and values of GRAVY, GC3content, or GC3skew. GRAVY is the mean of the sum of the hydropathic index of each amino acid in the protein, and thus reflects amino acid composition.53GC3content is the relative frequency of guanine and cytosine, (G + C)/(A + T + G + C), at the third codon position in the nucleotide sequence, and GC3skew is the deviation from equal amounts of guanine and cytosine, (G − C)/(G + C), at the third codon position in the nucleotide sequence. Pearson’s product moment correlation coefficient (r) between the axis scores and gene feature values was calculated. The square of r measures the percentage of variance; e.g. the square of 0.70 indicates that 49% of the variance in the axis scores is explained by the variance in the gene feature values. For each axis, the gene feature with an absolute r value (|r|) >0.70 was identified as the main source of variation among genes on the axis. At lower threshold |r| values, different gene features were detected on the same axis and/or the same gene feature was detected on more than one axis, and thus the interpretation of the axes becomes quite difficult. Additionally, low |r| values may be statistically significantly different from zero due to very large sample sizes, but weak correlations may have no biological meaning.Secondly, to analyze the correlation between scores of each of the three axes [Equation (4)] and levels of gene expression (Expression), we tested for the distribution of the axis scores for 40 genes expected to be expressed constitutively at high levels.10 This set included the genes encoding translation elongation factors Tu (tuf), Ts (tsf) and G (fus), and 37 of the larger ribosomal proteins (encoded by genes rplA-rplF, rplI-rplT, and rpsB-rpsT). In each axis, the score for each gene was standardized by subtracting the mean and dividing by the standard deviation of scores for all protein genes. For each axis, Expression was detected as the main source of variation among genes on the axis when the mean absolute standard score for the 40 highly expressed genes was >1.644854 (an interval in which theoretically only 5% of all protein genes are included).3. Results and discussion3.1. Performance of different CA methodsCA summarizes high dimensional data, such as codon counts, by reducing them to a limited number of variables (axes). We tested the ability of the four CA methods, CA-AF, CA-RF, CA-RSCU, and WCA, to generate axes that correspond to variation in synonymous codon usage. We considered two commonly used gene features: GC3content is the G + C content at the third codon position, and GC3skew that reflects the bias in G over C content at the third codon position. We investigated how often these two gene features were correlated with one of the first three axes in 241 bacterial genomes (Table 1). To illustrate our method, Fig. 1 shows scatter plots of axis 1 scores obtained by the four methods, plotted against GC3skew for R. prowazekii Madrid E genes. At the threshold |r| value of 0.70, GC3skew values were significantly correlated with axis 1 scores of WCA (|r| = 0.84), but not with those of CA-AF (|r| = 0.46), CA-RF (|r| = 0.32), and CA-RSCU (|r| = 0.04). Thus, in R. prowazekii Madrid E, GC3skew was detected on axis 1 of WCA, but not on axis 1 of CA-AF, CA-RF, and CA-RSCU. GC3content was detected in 191 genomes when the WCA method was used, which was more than when CA-AF (150), CA-RF (143), or CA-RSCU (145) were used (Table 1A). Likewise, the total number of genomes where GC3skew was detected (108) was also greater when WCA was used than when CA-AF (46), CA-RF (30), and CA-RSCU (53) were used (Table 1B). Thus, WCA detected GC3content and GC3skew more often than CA-AF, CA-RF, and CA-RSCU.Scatter plot showing axis 1 scores obtained by different CA methods, CA-AF (A), CA-RF (B), CA-RSCU (C), and WCA (D), plotted against GC3skew for R. prowazekii Madrid E genes.

Similar results were obtained when only long sequences with >300 codons were used (data not shown). We also verified the consistency of the results when using detection thresholds below |r| = 0.70 (data not shown). Thus we conclude that WCA is more effective than the other three methods in generating axes that correspond to variation in synonymous codon usage, regardless of the data sets and statistical criteria used.WCA may have performed best because it does not mask variation in synonymous codon usage caused by amino acid composition and codon degeneracy. CA-AF may have performed worse because it is confounded by amino acid composition. CA-RF and CA-RSCU did not perform as well as WCA possibly because their input data depend on the degree of codon degeneracy, which differs among amino acids [da in Equations (2) and (3) in Section 2.2].54 Later, we demonstrate these effects on the four CA methods.3.2. Effect of amino acid composition and codon degeneracy in different CA methodsTo determine the effect of amino acid composition, we tested the ability of the four CA methods, CA-AF, CA-RF, CA-RSCU, and WCA, to generate axes that correspond to variation in amino acid composition. The protein feature GRAVY, which represents the global hydrophobicity of proteins, can be used to measure the variation in amino acid composition among proteins.55 We investigated how often GRAVY was correlated with one of the first three axes in 241 bacterial genomes. CA-AF detected the correlation between GRAVY and one of the first three axes in 144 genomes, whereas CA-RF, CA-RSCU, and WCA did not detect it (Table 1C). This result suggests that CA-AF can generate axes corresponding to variation in amino acid composition as well as synonymous codon usage, whereas CA-RF, CA-RSCU, and WCA never generate such axes because they compensate for differences in amino acid composition.The use of RF and RSCU to remove the confounding effects of amino acid composition introduces other effects associated with the degree of codon degeneracy, which may be pronounced for rare amino acids. To determine the effect of the difference in the degree of codon degeneracy between amino acids, we compared the contributions to axis 1 of nine amino acids with low (twofold) degeneracy and three amino acids with high (sixfold) degeneracy, totaling 18 codons each. This was done for the four CA methods, CA-AF, CA-RF, CA-RSCU, and WCA. Fig. 2 shows scatter plots of the contribution of twofold degenerate codons (y-axis) plotted against that of sixfold degenerate codons (x-axis) for 241 bacterial genomes. The scatter plots for CA-AF and WCA (Fig. 2A and D) displayed genome distributions less biased toward twofold or sixfold degenerate codons than the scatter plots for CA-RF and CA-RSCU (Fig. 2B and C). For CA-RF, 208 (86%) of the 241 genomes fell above the line y = x, indicating that twofold degenerate codons contributed more to the axis than sixfold degenerate codons in most genomes (Fig. 2B). For CA-RSCU, 238 (99%) of the 241 genomes were below the line y = x, indicating that sixfold degenerate codons contributed more to the axis than twofold degenerate codons in most genomes (Fig. 2C). Thus, CA-RF and CA-RSCU tend to generate axes corresponding to variation in low (twofold) and high (sixfold) degenerate codons, respectively. This observation can be explained by the dependence of their input data on the degree of codon degeneracy [da in Equations (2) and (3) in Section 2.2]. Thus, the use of RF and RSCU to remove effects of amino acid usage introduces other effects associated with the degree of codon degeneracy, whereas WCA does not. In spite of these shortcomings, these methods, in particular CA-RSCU, are still frequently used.26–37 We recommend using WCA for analyzing synonymous codon usage.Contributions of twofold and sixfold degenerate codons to axis 1, obtained by different CA methods, CA-AF (A), CA-RF (B), CA-RSCU (C), and WCA (D), for 241 bacterial genomes.

Sources of intragenomic variation in synonymous codon usage among genesWe applied WCA to the genomes of 241 bacterial species to identify major sources of intragenomic variation in synonymous codon usage among genes. In addition to the two gene features described earlier (GC3content and GC3skew), gene expression level (Expression) was also considered. In 57 genomes, WCA detected one of the three gene features, GC3content, GC3skew, and Expression on axis 1 but none of the features on axes 2 and 3 (Supplementary Table S2). In 97 other genomes, WCA detected two of the three gene features on axes 1 and 2 but none of the gene features on axis 3. All three features were detected on the first three axes of 40 genomes, and only in nine genomes were no gene features detected on the first three axes. The results demonstrate that the three gene features can contribute to intragenomic variations in synonymous codon usage among genes, and that their relative contributions vary among different genomes.CA of codon usage data generated axes on which no gene feature was detected. There are three possible explanations for this observation. First, in some cases, the axis was moderately correlated with one of the gene features considered here, but the correlation was not strong enough to reach the detection threshold. For example in Shewanella putrefaciens CN-32, the |r| value between axis 1 of WCA and GC3content (0.68) was below the threshold |r| value of 0.70. Secondly, although the axis was not correlated with any of the gene features considered here, it may be correlated with other relevant gene features that can be determined computationally or experimentally; e.g. protein abundance56 and mRNA half-life.57 Thirdly, variation among genes on the axis, even if the axis accounts for the largest fractions of the total variation among genes, may have no biological meaning. These possibilities should be kept in mind when interpreting the axes generated by CA of codon usage data.For 10 genomes in our study that were previously analyzed by CA (Table 2), we compared our findings with previous conclusions. First, GC3content was detected as a primary source of synonymous codon usage variation among genes in E. coli K12 MG1655, M. genitalium G37, T. maritima MSB8, and H. pylori 26695. G + C content was previously detected in these first three genomes (previous analysis for H. pylori is not directly comparable). Intragenomic variation in G + C content mostly reflects the existence of regions with anomalous nucleotide composition, putatively acquired by horizontal transfer.2 The exception to this is M. genitalium, in which intragenomic G + C variation is continuous along the genome.58 Thus if the WCA axis clearly separates anomalous gene clusters from other genes, the axis scores can be used to predict genes that have recently transferred.Gene features that are significantly correlated with one of three axes generated by WCA in 10 bacterial genomesaPrevious studies, whose results do not necessarily agree with those shown here. See Section 3.3 for conflicts.bnd, none of the gene features considered here were detected.Gene features that are significantly correlated with one of three axes generated by WCA in 10 bacterial genomesaPrevious studies, whose results do not necessarily agree with those shown here. See Section 3.3 for conflicts.bnd, none of the gene features considered here were detected.The second feature, GC3skew was detected as a primary source of synonymous codon usage variation among genes in B. burgdorferi B31, C. trachomatis D/UW-3/CX, R. prowazekii Madrid E, and T. pallidum Nichols (Table 2 and Fig. 1). Intragenomic variation in GC3skew presumably reflects differences in mutational bias between the leading and lagging strands of replication.5,6 This mutational bias was previously detected in each of these genomes, except R. prowazekii.47 Thus in genomes where GC3skew is detected on axis 1 of WCA, the axis scores can be used to predict whether the gene is located on the leading or lagging strands.The third feature, Expression, was detected as a major source of synonymous codon usage variation among genes in C. trachomatis D/UW-3/CX, C. perfringens 13, E. coli K12 MG1655 and H. influenzae Rd KW20, which is consistent with previous findings (Table 2). The relative contribution of Expression varies among different genomes; e.g. Expression is a primary source in H. influenzae, while it is a secondary source in E. coli. The anomalous codon usage of highly expressed genes presumably reflects natural selection for optimal codons that are translated more efficiently and accurately; so-called translational selection.7,8 In B. burgdorferi and M. genitalium, conflicting conclusions regarding the presence or absence of translational selection on synonymous codon usage have been reported.21 In the present analysis, Expression was not detected in these two genomes, suggesting there is no evidence for translational selection. This is in agreement with conclusions drawn using a different statistical method.10 Thus in genomes where Expression is detected by WCA, the axis scores can be used to predict gene expression level and compared with experimental expression data obtained by DNA microarray (transcriptomes) and 2D gel electrophoresis (proteomes).3.4. ConclusionOf the four CA methods, WCA was found to be most useful for the analysis of synonymous codon usage. Using WCA, it may be possible to find new factors that can explain variation in synonymous codon usage among genes, and improve the accuracy of identifying genes that have been horizontally transferred or are highly expressed.4.

IntroductionOligonucleotide microarrays such as Affymetrix GeneChip have opened opportunities for the high-throughput observation of gene expressions. For the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana), >3000 gene-expression data have been measured by different research groups and stored in online repositories such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO),1 The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR),2 and the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre Arrays (NASC).3 Also available are the functional prediction tools based on gene co-expression, such as AthCoR@CSB.DB,4 Genevestigator,5 ATTED-II6 and KAGIANA.7 Most of the prediction tools measure similarity of co-expression by Pearson’s or Spearman’s rank correlation with P-value across various biological and experimental conditions. Such similarity measure has been exploited to identify functioning genes among candidates otherwise indistinguishable from sequence annotations.8,9Since correlation coefficient depends on the quality and the number of data sets, the selection of expression data is crucial for better prediction. For example, Pearson’s correlation results in bad estimates under the existence of outliers, or when the relationship between genes is nonlinear. Revealing complex gene-to-gene relationship such as in primary metabolism therefore requires a careful data pre-processing, i.e. selection of microarray data to delineate ‘true’ gene correlations. For example, Obayashi et al. used empirically weighted Pearson’s correlation in their ATTED-II server to reduce information redundancy in the 1388 GeneChip data from TAIR (see also the help page in the web site http://www.atted.bio.titech.ac.jp/). Wei et al.10 manually selected 486 so-called ‘high-quality’ GeneChip data from NASC so that computed correlation would be biologically meaningful. Although effectiveness of such strategies has been demonstrated in several studies,8,11 it is unclear how much data are required, or which data repository are to be used. Data bias such as tissue distribution in repositories is also unknown. We examined three major online repositories (TAIR, NASC and GEO) and confirmed the benefit of using different, but not necessarily all, GeneChip data. Our study is based on singular value decomposition (SVD)12,13 and AraCyc metabolic pathways for overall verification of gene co-expressions.2. Materials and methods2.1. Gene-expression data sources and pre-processingIn this study, we collected and merged data from three major online repositories for A. thaliana gene expressions: TAIR (http://www.arabidopsis.org/), NASC (http://affymetrix.arabidopsis.info/) and GEO (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/). After removing redundancy, the combined data set resulted in 2364 Affymetrix ATH1 GeneChip CEL files. (We used only ATH1 chips, which cover 80% of all genes with 23 000 probes. AG chips with 8000 probes were discarded). Each file was manually classified according to their sample tissue and experimental conditions. The classified data represented 133 experimental series, which are listed in Supplementary Table S1. The raw CEL files were pre-processed by the Robust Multi-chip Average (RMA) Algorithm,14 in which perfect match intensities of array probes are modeled as the sum of exponential and Gaussian distributions for the signal and background, respectively.2.2. SVD compression of data matrix2.3. Rank calculation for pathway genes and its evaluationPearson’s correlation coefficient (r-value) and its significance (P-value) are used to measure the gene co-expression. A list of 1638 probe sets related to 219 pathways was first obtained from AraCyc dump file (ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Pathways/aracyc_dump_20070703), to form the m × n matrix A, where m is the number of AraCyc genes (m = 1638), and n the number of arrays (n = 2364), respectively. The computed SVs of the matrix were sorted and the largest k SVs were used to reconstruct the approximated matrix Ak as in Equation (2). Using approximated matrices, correlation coefficients between all AraCyc genes were calculated. Co-expressions that did not satisfy each threshold (r > 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9, respectively) were discarded. The cutoff threshold was introduced to better separate inter- and intra-pathway correlations by removing majority of insignificant (low) correlations. For the remaining gene co-expressions, the average rank of intra-pathway co-expressions was calculated on 78 pathways that were associated with ≥10 metabolic genes in the database (see also Supplementary Table S2).3. Results and discussion3.1. Distribution of microarray experiments in public databasesAccording to tissue types and experimental conditions, the 2364 array data were manually classified into 133 experimental series, whose complete listing is available as Supplementary Table S1. TAIR contains 49 experimental series (e.g. development, biotic- or abiotic-treatments, and hormone treatment), NASC provides 55 series (e.g. lignification, plant defense responses, and carbohydrate metabolism through the diurnal cycle and others), and GEO enlists 29 series (e.g. phenotypic diversity, altered environmental plasticity, stamen development and diurnal cycle effect in leaves).There are notable differences among the three repositories. First is the tissue distribution in each repository as in Fig. 1. Data from shoot and cell suspension occupy >15% only in TAIR, and data from stamen exist only in GEO. Tissue distribution is almost balanced in TAIR, but significantly biased in NASC and GEO. Another difference is the number of GeneChip data. From this, we can at least conclude that data from all three repositories are necessary to accurately observe gene expressions in different tissue types. In the following study, we merged three data sets into a single collection without duplication.Pie chart of the biomaterials of array data in each data repository.Pie chart of the biomaterials of array data in each data repository.3.2. Dimensional compression by SVDWe saw that the tissue distribution of microarray data is biased. Another source of bias is hundreds of ‘reference’ (or wild-type) data in the repositories. Even if data look biased, i.e. multiple microarrays seem to show highly similar expression patterns, it is not easy to tell whether they are indeed redundant. The SVD algorithm was employed to check this redundancy (See Materials and methods). Fig. 2 shows the distributions of correlation coefficient for all gene pairs calculated by matrix approximation reconstructed using largest 20, 40, 300, 700 SVs and without SVD. The distribution of correlations fitted well with the Gaussian distribution for all reconstructions, and the standard deviations (SD) were 0.34, 0.31, 0.27, 0.26, and 0.26, respectively. The top 20 or 40 SVs could already reproduce the original distribution, implying that we may disregard smaller SVs as noise. The number 20 (or 40) is not an optimal value, but serves as a rough estimate. The reason for choosing these values will be explained later.Distribution of correlation coefficient from five types of data matrices (with- and without-SVD compression) normalized by RMA. Data matrices were reconstructed by largest 20 SVs (solid line), 40 SVs (lower dotted line), 300 and 700 SVs (upper dotted lines), and without-SVD (outermost dotted line). The SD of each distribution are 0.34, 0.31, 0.27, 0.26 and 0.26, respectively.Distribution of correlation coefficient from five types of data matrices (with- and without-SVD compression) normalized by RMA.

The SD of each distribution are 0.34, 0.31, 0.27, 0.26 and 0.26, respectively.To check the effect of dimensional reduction in detail, we first verified Pearson’s correlation coefficient (r), its rank and P-value (P) for two well-known gene regulatory mechanisms: negative feedback loop and transcription factor.The central circadian clock (Fig. 3) is a typical non-metabolic regulatory mechanism. When we used all 2364 arrays, strong positive correlation between two Myb-like transcription factor genes, Circadian Clock Associated 1 (CCA1) and Late Elongated Hypocotyl (LHY) was observed, as well as weak negative correlation between Timing Of Cab expression 1 (TOC1) and LHY, and between TOC1 and CCA1 (Fig. 3A–C and Table 1). These values agreed well with known facts that TOC1 is a positive regulator of CCA1 and LHY, and that the two clock-associated genes form a negative–positive transcriptional feedback loop.15 Table 1 shows the trend of their correlations and ranks.

Myb28 or R2R3-MYB transcription factor, is a positive regulator of aliphatic methionine-derived glucosinolates (GSL) investigated in the authors’ institution,8,16 offering a typical example of metabolic regulation by a non-metabolic gene. As in the clock case, the approximation kept the rank of interaction even for 20 SVs (Table 2). We also compared the correlation values with that of ATTED-II version 3 (1388 GeneChips from TAIR).6 ATTED-II is a widely known and regularly updated correlation analysis software tool for Arabidopsis. Table 2 demonstrates that correlation values obtained by using largest 20 SVs are comparable with those by ATTED-II.Correlation coefficients and their ranks (in parentheses) among Myb28-regulated GSL biosynthetic genes [NS, not significant (P ≥ 1E−300)]Correlation coefficients and their ranks (in parentheses) among Myb28-regulated GSL biosynthetic genes [NS, not significant (P ≥ 1E−300)]The two regulatory examples suggest that blindly increasing the number of GeneChip data does not automatically lead to increased accuracy. By carefully choosing a smaller set of expression data, accurate functional prediction comparable with a state-of-the-art software tool becomes feasible.3.3. Using AraCyc metabolic pathways to evaluate gene co-expressionsNext, we investigated the correlations among metabolic pathway genes. It is impossible to rigorously assess the effect of dimensional compression due to the absence of a set of ‘true’ gene–gene association inside metabolic pathways. As an alternative, we utilize a credible observation that, on an average, genes associated with the same metabolic pathway are highly co-expressed than genes from different pathways.10,17 For assessment, we first selected 78 pathways which were associated with ≥10 metabolic genes in the AraCyc database (Supplementary Table S2).These pathways contained 1638 genes in total. We computed the co-expressions between all pairs of genes and obtained the average rank of intra-pathway co-expressions as in Wei et al.10 According to the pathway hypothesis, intra-pathway correlations are ranked lower (i.e. highly correlated) than inter-pathway correlations. Fig. 4 shows the trend of the average rank of intra-pathway correlations using reconstructed matrices of the SV index k for different threshold r (see Materials and methods). In the figure, the lowest average rank was achieved ∼20 SVs for most threshold values. In other words, 20 SVs are enough to separate intra-pathway co-expressions, and the set of arrays corresponding to these SVs is considered most informative among 2364 experiments. When r = 0.5, the lowest average rank runs between 15 and 35 and slightly jumps up at ∼40. This effect seems to be an artifact specific to the threshold 0.5 for unknown reason. Also, average ranks for different r look stabilized around k = 20. From these observations, we set the (roughly) minimum number of SVs as 20 (and 40) in our analysis.Evaluation of AraCyc genes in co-expression rankings against various thresholds (r = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9). Average ranks of intra-pathway correlations using reconstructed matrices were calculated across the 78 AraCyc pathways that contain ≥10 genes in ATH1 GeneChip.Evaluation of AraCyc genes in co-expression rankings against various thresholds (r = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6, 0.7, 0.8 and 0.9). Average ranks of intra-pathway correlations using reconstructed matrices were calculated across the 78 AraCyc pathways that contain ≥10 genes in ATH1 GeneChip.3.4. Estimation of the number of informative arraysHaving confirmed the effectiveness of reconstruction from a small number of SVs, we estimated the informative set of arrays, i.e. array information that are most amplified by the decomposition by regarding the SVs as the amplification factor of orthonormal basis vectors representing array experiments. The matrix Ak in Equation (2) was approximated by zeroing elements less than a threshold λ (let Bk = [Ak]>λ be this matrix), and the dimension of BkT corresponds to the number of significant arrays contributing to the k SVs in Ak. When the dimension was plotted against the increasing value of λ for different SVs, it rapidly decreased as the λ increased but the dimension was almost consistent for SVs ranging between 10 and 50 (Fig. 5). The result partially supported the dominance of large SVs as in Section 3.2, but we could not determine an appropriate λ to determine the size of informative arrays.The plot of the number of arrays (y-axis) against λ (x-axis from 1 to 10) for different SVs. Each bar corresponds to 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 SVs from left to right. The number of significant columns rapidly decreases as the λ increases, and contributing arrays are independent of the number of SVs.The plot of the number of arrays (y-axis) against λ (x-axis from 1 to 10) for different SVs. Each bar corresponds to 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 SVs from left to right. The number of significant columns rapidly decreases as the λ increases, and contributing arrays are independent of the number of SVs.Most amplified array sets were the stamen development (GSE4733) and the Type III effectors on plant defense response (NASCarrays-59). Other significant arrays included profiles of early germinating seeds (ME00332), the response to bacterial-(LPS, HrpZ, Flg22) and oomycete-(NPP1) derived elicitors (ME00319), oxidative stress (GSE7211) and alternative oxidases (GSE4113 and GSE2406). These results indicated the importance of use of different tissue types in gene correlation analysis.3.5. Correspondence between each SV and genes or experimental conditionsTo evaluate the correspondence between a specific SV (δ) and genes or arrays, δ-dependent reconstructed expression data matrices with the gene sets of AraCyc were examined. The matrices were reconstructed according to the scheme in Supplementary Fig. S1. Briefly, we first performed SVD analysis on the data matrix and the resulting diagonal matrix Σ was transformed into δ-only Σ′. The diagonal elements of matrix Σ′ are zero values, except for the δ under focus. Using this Σ′, δ-reconstructed expression data matrix was obtained. To see which experimental conditions and genes most contributed to δ (Fig. 6), a hierarchical clustering approach was performed using the data matrix. Let us explain five largest SVs by denoting the ith largest SV as δi. In Supplementary Fig. S2, we provide breakdown charts of GO categories for each gene cluster corresponding to these SVs.Hierarchical clustering of the reconstructed data matrices using only one SV δ. (A–E) Show the matrix reconstructed by the largest SV δ1 to fifth largest value δ5. Columns are experimental series and rows are genes; both of which are hierarchically clustered in each figure. Magenta denotes the positive value of the reconstructed matrix Bk and the cyan the negative value.Hierarchical clustering of the reconstructed data matrices using only one SV δ. (A–E) Show the matrix reconstructed by the largest SV δ1 to fifth largest value δ5. Columns are experimental series and rows are genes; both of which are hierarchically clustered in each figure. Magenta denotes the positive value of the reconstructed matrix Bk and the cyan the negative value.The contribution of δ1 was not limited to any experimental condition or arrays but was related to specific gene clusters. Two clusters of highly positive values were formed (Fig. 6A and Supplementary Fig. S2). Supplementary Data 1 displays the full image of the hierarchical clusters of arrays marked in Fig. 6. The upper cluster in Fig. 6A (Group g1 of δ1 in Supplementary Fig. S2) contained genes associated with aerobic respiration pathway, carbonate dehydratase (in nitrogen metabolism) and photosynthesis. The middle cluster (Group g2) included genes related to glycolysis, aerobic respiration, glutamate metabolism and TCA cycle. The lower cluster (Group g3) included genes for (deoxy) ribose phosphate degradation, steroid biosynthesis, and diterpenoid biosynthesis (gibberellin inactivation). Therefore δ1 largely corresponded to a variety of major metabolic pathways in primary metabolism irrespective of experiments.On the other hand, values from δ2 to δ5 were associated with specific experimental conditions. The δ2 was linked with two large experimental clusters shown in Fig. 6B. The magenta region in the left-hand side corresponded to the shoot data of stress series (heat, UV-B, salt, wound, cold, oxidative and drought; Group atr2 of δ2 in Supplementary Fig. S2) whereas the right-hand region contained the root data of the same experimental series (Group atr1 of δ2 in Supplementary Fig. S2. See also Supplementary Data1). Relevant genes were associated with photosynthesis and glycolysis/gluconeogenesis, but many genes show medium or low correlations. Notable observation was therefore the marked contrast between root and shoot irrespective of experimental series.Likewise, δ3 corresponded to two biotic treatment conditions: response to virulent (accession, ME00331) and response to bacterial-(LPS, HrpZ, Flg22) and oomycete-NPP1 (accession, ME00332). The δ3 still depends on experimental series (vertical direction in Fig. 6), but high correlation in certain group of genes is also observed (horizontal direction in Fig. 6). The correspondences for δ4 and δ5 were obscurer, but as their commonly highlighted experimental conditions we could recognize stamen development data set (accession, GSE4733) with gene sets for cytokinins 9-N-glucoside biosynthesis and cytokinins 7-N-glucoside biosynthesis.In summary, we could identify biological functions related to the largest five SVs, although each SV did not precisely correspond to specific experimental conditions or genes. We could again confirm the importance of the use of different tissue types (e.g. shoot/root under stress and stamen development).Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis research was supported by Grant-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas ‘Systems Genomics' from MEXT and BIRD, Japan Science and Technology Agency.We thank Drs Yuji Sawada, and Masami Yokota-Hirai at RIKEN PSC for fruitful discussions.

IntroductionMicrobial communities (microbiota) inhabiting the human body sites have long been recognized to play critical roles in human health and disease. Collective genomes (microbiome) of the human microbiota have now become important targets to be studied in both microbiology and human biology.1 Among the human microbiota, the gut microbiota are most abundant in number of microbial species accounting for ≥1000 species, which shape a very complex and dynamic microbial community with high interindividual variations.2 The large-scale bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA sequence and metagenomic analyses of the gut microbiome have provided a great progress for a better understanding of the ecological and biological natures of the human gut microbiota.3–7 However, genomic sequences of individual members constituting the microbiota are also needed, and important to more precisely interpret the enumerative data that will be accumulated in future studies including the International Human Microbiome Project.8Escherichia coli (E. coli) is one of the common members in the human gut microbiota. Over the past decades, there have been many reports on the phylogenetic and genomic analyses of E. coli strains isolated from various sources including humans, animals and various environments.9–19 Among isolated E. coli strains, the whole-genome sequencing analysis has been extensively performed for pathogenic strains to explore the pathogenicity and identify virulence-associated genes in these strains.20–26 In contrast, the whole-genomic sequencing of non-pathogenic E. coli strains has been limited for several E. coli K-12 strains that have long been used in genetic studies and recombinant DNA technologies.27–30 Since E. coli K-12 strain was originally isolated from the stool of a convalescent diphtheria patient in 1922, these sequenced K-12-derived strains, MG1655, W3110 and DH10B, may have undergone spontaneous genetic changes during preservation and successive passages at the laboratory, resulting in the accumulation of mutations in genes and loss of many features representing the wild-type commensal E. coli.31–33 Nevertheless, the genomic sequencing analysis of human commensal E. coli strains is quite scarce. Only two human commensal strains HS and Nissle 1917 have been completely or partially sequenced.26,34,35 This is surprising because the wild-type commensal strain is a good reference genome in the human gut microbiota research and useful to explore the genetic and functional features adapted to human gut habitat, and the comparison with the laboratory strain K-12 or pathogenic strains will provide new insights into the structural and evolutionary aspect of commensal E. coli strains.In this study, we sequenced the genome of commensal E. coli strain-designated SE11 isolated from feces of a healthy adult and performed the comparative analysis with other sequenced E. coli genomes. This paper may be the first report demonstrating the complete genome sequence analysis of the wild-type commensal E. coli strain belonging to phylogenetic group B1, distant from strains K-12 and HS belonging to phylogenetic group A in E. coli reference (ECOR) collection.362. Materials and methods2.1. Isolation of E. coli strains from fresh feces of a healthy adult humanOne gram of feces collected from a healthy adult human was suspended in 9.0 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (pH 7.0). Serially diluted solutions were inoculated on deoxycholate hydrogen sulfide lactose (DHL) agar (Eiken Chemical Co. Ltd.) and incubated at 37°C for 24 h. Eight red colonies on the DHL agar plates were picked up and subjected to single colony isolation twice on Luria-Burtani (LB) agar plates. The eight isolates were identified as E. coli on the basis of the following characteristics: gram negative, rod shape, growth under the aerobic and anaerobic conditions, spore formation negative, motile, production of gas/lactic acid from glucose/lactose. Each isolate was grown in LB broth at 37°C for 24 h and stored in the LB medium containing 10% glycerol at −85°C until used for further analysis.2.2. Random amplification of polymorphic DNA fingerprintingEight E. coli isolates were analyzed by random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) fingerprinting method using three primers (1247, 5′-AAGAGCCCGT-3′; 1254, 5′-CCGCAGCCAA-3′; 1290, 5′-GTGGATGCGA-3′).37 A fresh colony grown on LB agar plate was transferred to a 1.5 mL microtube. The cells were disrupted using microwave (500 W for 1 min) and suspended in 5.0 µL of double-distilled water (ddH2O). After spindown, the supernatant was used as template DNA in RAPD analysis. The 50.0 µL polymerase chain reaction (PCR) mixture contained 5.0 µL of template DNA, 4.0 µL of each primer (10 µM), 5.0 µL of 10× PCR buffer, 4.0 µL of dNTP mixture, 0.25 µL of Ex Taq polymerase (Takara Bio Inc.), and 27.75 µL of ddH2O. PCR amplification was performed in the iCycler Thermal Cycler (Bio-Rad) according to the following protocol: 1 cycle of 10 min at 94°C; 30 cycles of 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 2 min at 72°C; and 1 cycle of 10 min at 72°C. Amplified DNA fragments were separated on 1.0% agarose gels (100 V for 30 min) and stained with ethidium bromide (0.2 µg/mL) for 30 min.2.3. Genome sequencingThe genome sequence of SE11 was determined by a whole-genome shotgun strategy. We constructed small-insert [2 kilobases (kb)], large-insert (10 kb) and fosmid (40 kb) genomic libraries, and generated 55 296 sequences using ABI 3730xl sequencers (Applied Biosystems), giving eightfold coverage from both ends of the genomic clones. Sequence reads were assembled with the Phred–Phrap–Consed program38 and gaps were closed by direct sequencing of clones that spanned the gaps or of PCR products amplified with oligonucleotide primers designed to anneal to each end of neighboring contigs. The overall accuracy of the finished sequence was estimated to have an error rate of <1 per 10 000 bases (Phrap score of ≥40).2.4. InformaticsAn initial set of predicted protein-coding genes was identified using Glimmer 2.0.39 Genes consisting <120 base pairs (bp) and those containing overlaps were eliminated. All predicted proteins were searched against a non-redundant protein database (nr, NCBI) using BLASTP with a bit-score cutoff of 60. The start codon of each protein-coding gene was manually refined from BLASTP alignments. The tRNA genes were predicted by the tRNAscan-SE40 and the rRNA genes were detected by BLASTN search using known E. coli rRNA sequences as queries. Protein domains were identified using the Pfam database. Orthology across whole-genomes has been determined using BLASTP reciprocal best hits with a bit-score cutoff of 60 in all-against-all comparisons of amino acid sequences. Two sequences were identified as poorly conserved orthologs if their BLAST score ratio is <0.8.41 Sequences of seven housekeeping genes of the ECOR strains were obtained from the multilocus sequence typing (MLST) website (http://web.mpiib-berlin.mpg.de) in the Max Planck Institute.42 These sequences were concatenated, and aligned by the neighbor-joining method with 1000 bootstrap iterations using ClustalW. The sequence data of the SE11 genome have been deposited in DDBJ/GenBank/EMBL and the accession numbers are as follows: AP009240 (chromosome), AP009241 (pSE11-1), AP009242 (pSE11-2), AP009243 (pSE11-3), AP009244 (pSE11-4), AP009245 (pSE11-5) and AP009246 (pSE11-6).3. Results3.1. Isolation and phylogenetic analysis of SE11We isolated eight E. coli strains from feces of a healthy adult as described in Materials and methods, and examined them by the RAPD method. Seven strains exhibited the same RAPD patterns in respective experiments using three different primer sets, thus revealing their structural identity of genomes. We therefore selected one E. coli strain-designated SE11 for further analysis and sequencing. The 16S rRNA sequence of SE11 showed the highest similarity (98.8% identity) to that of E. coli ATCC 11775T (accession no. X80725). From the MLST analysis based on the nucleotide sequences of seven housekeeping genes,42 SE11 was found to belong to phylogenetic group B1 whose members predominate in the human gut microbiota,9 and is phylogenetically distinct from K-12 and HS strains in group A and more from human pathogenic strains mostly belonging to group B2 or E in ECOR collection (Supplementary Fig. S1). Most of commensal E. coli strains belonging to groups A and B1 were shown to be avirulent in mice.43 SE11 has an O152:H28 serotype, which is less frequently found in enteroinvasive E. coli.44,453.2. General features and gene content in SE11The genome of E. coli SE11 consists of a circular chromosome of 4 887 515 bp and six plasmids (100.0, 91.2, 60.6, 6.9, 5.4 and 4.1 kb) (Figs 1 and 2). General features of the SE11 genome were shown in Table 1. The chromosome size of SE11 is larger than those of the laboratory K-12 strains, and smaller than those of pathogenic strains sequenced to date (Supplementary Table S1). The SE11 chromosome contained 4679 predicted protein-coding genes, 86 tRNA genes, and 22 rRNA genes, and the six plasmids contained a total of 323 predicted protein-coding genes. Of all protein-coding genes predicted in SE11, we could assign 2944 (59%) protein-coding genes to known functions, 1895 (38%) to genes of unknown function conserved in many bacterial genomes, and 163 (3%) to novel hypothetical genes. We identified 52 copies of insertion sequence (IS) elements in the SE11 genome (Supplementary Table S2). These IS elements are classified into 27 families, and the IS677 family (10 copies as intact forms) was most predominant in SE11.Circular representation of the SE11 chromosome.

Classification of the 5002 protein-coding genes in SE11 was summarized in Fig. 3. Of the 3754 highly conserved genes, 2802 were also conserved in all 14 sequenced E. coli genomes. Of the 1186 genes, 170 were unique to SE11 among the 14 E. coli genomes. The 1186 genes absent in MG1655 comprised 438 mobile elements-related, 356 conserved function-unknown, 108 hypothetical and 284 genes with assigned functions including metabolic genes of oligosaccharides such as sugar, cellobiose, mannose and N-acetylgalactosamine, a gene for bile salt hydrolase, tetracycline-resistant genes and genes associated with fimbriae on the bacterial cell surface (discussed later). The 356 conserved hypothetical genes and 284 genes with assigned functions in SE11 were listed in Supplementary Table S3. On the other hand, the 317 genes that were present in MG1655 but absent in SE11 comprised 186 (59%) mobile elements-related and 131 unique genes including those involved in the restriction/modification system and acetoacetate metabolism (Supplementary Table S4). The 62 poorly conserved genes between SE11 and MG1655 may have the higher mutation rate than other conserved E. coli genes and included some of genes of the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) biosynthesis (Supplementary Table S5). Outer core oligosaccharide in LPS is highly variable in structure and five distinct outer core types in E. coli are known.46 The outer core oligosaccharide of SE11 was found to be of R3 type in this study. The comparative analysis with the phylogenetically closest E24377A, an enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) isolate, also revealed that both strains shared the highest number of 4112 orthologs, of which only 41 protein-coding genes were not found in other sequenced E. coli strains and may be regarded as group B1-specific genes (Supplementary Table S3). From these comparative analyses of E. coli genes, it was found that SE11 lacked genes homologous to known or suspected toxins and extracellular enzymes such as Shiga toxins, alpha-hemolysin and enterohemolysin that are involved in the virulence of pathogenic E. coli strains as well as genes for heat-labile and heat-stable enterotoxins encoded on the plasmids in ETEC E24377A.26Classification of all 5002 protein-coding genes in SE11 based on comparison with those in MG1655 and 12 other E. coli strains.

Number of classified genes are given in parentheses.3.3. Prophages and integrative elementsIn the SE11 chromosome, there are seven prophage regions (PP_SE11-1 to -7; 36–53 kb in length) and three integrative elements (IE_SE11-1 to -3; 7–33 kb in length) that contained an integrase gene but no genes for apparent phages, transposons and integrative conjugative elements. Many of these integrated regions were flanked by short sequence duplications that are hallmarks of the lateral transfer event (Table 2). Comparative analysis with MG1655 showed that the SE11 chromosome contained 47 regions (>5 kb) that are absent in MG1655 (Fig. 4). Of these additional regions in the SE11 chromosome, we identified nine large segments (>30 kb), eight of which overlapped with all seven prophage regions (PP_SE11-1 to -7) and one integrative element (IE_SE11-1) described earlier (Table 2). Only a large segment (ECSE_0213–0239) near the aspV tRNA gene contained no apparent integrase gene, phage-related gene, transposase gene, and direct repeat, and mostly encoded proteins with unknown function. Integrative elements corresponding to this large segment were also retained at the same loci in the chromosomes of E24377A and phylogenetically distant strain EHEC O157 and UPEC 536, suggesting that MG1655 might have lost this locus during evolution (Supplementary Fig. S2).Locations and lengths of the strain-specific segments.

The total length of the strain-specific segment (>5 kb) is indicated under each strain name.Prophages and integrative elements in the SE11 chromosomeProphages and integrative elements in the SE11 chromosomeThe genomes of pathogenic E. coli strains contain many prophages and other genetic elements that are the major sources for genes encoding virulence factors, such as toxins, type III secretion systems (TTSS), and effector proteins secreted by the TTSS.47,48 We compared the highly conserved prophages in SE11, MG1655 and O157 Sakai to analyze differences in structure and gene contents. PP_SE11-1 exhibits structural features similar to those of lambda-like prophage Sp8 in O157 Sakai and lambda-like prophage DLP12 in MG1655 at the same integration loci, but both PP_SE11-1 and DLP12 lacked the virulence-related catalase gene in Sp8 (Fig. 5A). PP_SE11-1 and DLP12 share 19 genes including the nmpC gene encoding a porin protein that allows small metabolites such as sugars, ions and amino acids to permeate. In addition, PP_SE11-1 and PP_SE11-5 shared a 23 kb almost identical segment that contains the additional nmpC homolog, suggesting that a very recent duplication of these regions may have occurred in SE11 (data not shown). The integrated locus of PP_SE11-2 is the same as those of lambda-like prophage Sp10 in O157 Sakai and lambda-like prophage Rac in MG1655 (Fig. 5B). These three prophages share many conserved genes but genes for three TTSS effectors and a Cu/Zn-superoxide dismutase encoded by Sp10 were missing in PP_SE11-2 and Rac. PP_SE11-3 was also found to integrate at the same locus as those of lambda-like prophages Sp11–Sp12 in O157 Sakai and lambda-like prophage Qin in MG1655, but the genes for TTSS effectors and a transcriptional regulator (PchB) encoded in Sp11–Sp12 were missing in PP_SE11-3 and Qin (Fig. 5C). Taken together with the results obtained from the analysis of genes in SE11, these data further indicate that SE11 and MG1655 do not possess prophage-borne virulence-associated genes found in O157 Sakai, despite the high conservation of these integrated elements among the three evolutionarily distant strains (Supplementary Fig. S1). At present, it is unknown whether the ancestral E. coli acquired virulence genes by prophage integration and thereafter they have been retained in O157 Sakai and lost in SE11 or it acquired non-virulent prophages and thereafter O157 Sakai has independently acquired the virulence genes but SE11 has not.Comparisons of the genomic location of three SE11 prophages with the corresponding location of the related prophages of K-12 and O157 strains.

Copy numbers of each plasmid in SE11 were estimated to be one copy for pSE11-1, pSE11-2, pSE11-3, and pSE11-4, and ∼2 copies for pSE11-5 and pSE11-6 by the number of sequence reads assembled in respective plasmids. Three small plasmids (pSE11-4, pSE11-5 and pSE11-6) were found to be cryptic. Four plasmids (pSE11-1, pSE11-2, pSE11-3 and pSE11-6) had the genes encoding replication protein. The replication proteins of pSE11-1, pSE11-2 and pSE11-3 showed the high sequence similarity to those of IncFII, ColV and F plasmids, respectively, and pSE11-6 had the replication protein 100% identical to that of the plasmid pSMS35_130 of E. coli SMS-3-5. Two plasmids (pSE11-4 and pSE11-5) have the genes for mobilization protein. Thus, the six plasmids found in SE11 are compatible in a cell. The pSE11-1 (100 021 bp) contained almost identical gene sets to those in the conjugate plasmid ColIb-P9 (93 399 bp, accession no. AB021078) except for several genes including tetracycline resistance genes tetR (ECSE_P1-0010) and tetA (ECSE_P1-0011). Both pSE11-1 and ColIb-P9 encoded the same set of genes for conjugational transfer (tra and trb genes), biogenesis of type IV pili (pil genes), and colicin Ib production and immunity. It has been reported that type IV pili encoded by IncI1 group plasmids of enteric bacteria (e.g. ColIb-P9) are required both for plasmid conjugation and adherence to host epithelial cells.49 The pSE11-2 (91 158 bp) is a conjugative plasmid containing the fimbrial operon (ECSE_P2-0001-0005) homologous to that of the F1 (Caf1) pili biogenesis whose genes are encoded on the virulence plasmid pMT1 in Yersinia pestis.50 The gene products encoded by the fimbrial operon in pSE11-2 and the caf1 operon in pMT1 showed 31–70% amino acid sequence identities. The pSE11-3 is a non-conjugative plasmid of 60 555 bp, and contained two chaperone-usher fimbrial operons. One is the fae operon encoding F4 (or K88) fimbriae (ECSE_P3-0031-0037), which was flanked by transposase genes. F4 fimbriae are the major colonization factors in some ETEC strains associated with porcine neonatal and postweaning diarrhea.51 The other fimbrial operon (ECSE_P3-0060-0066) showed no strong similarity to entries in public databases.3.5. Genes for fimbriae and autotransporter in SE11Three loci of chaperone-usher pathways and one operon of type IV pilus encoded on the SE11 plasmids were almost completely missing in other sequenced E. coli strains. Certain E. coli strains were shown to be fimbriated and conferred the ability to adhere to host intestinal cells by the presence of a plasmid encoding fimbrial genes.52 SE11 also contains at least 13 loci for the fimbrial biosynthesis on the chromosome, accounting for a total of 17 loci, many of which were missing or present as truncated forms in other sequenced E. coli genomes (Table 3). MG1655 lacked two of 13 chromosomal loci encoding the fimbrial biosynthesis in SE11. One of these two loci is the lpf operon (ECSE_4015–4018) for the synthesis of long polar fimbriae that are known to mediate bacterial cell adhesion to host epithelial cells.53 Of sequenced E. coli strains, E24377A, SMS-3-5 and O157 Sakai contained the lpf operon at the position between glmS and pstS. The lpf operon in SE11 is almost identical with 99–100% amino acid sequence identity of that in E24377A and divergent from those of SMS-3–5 (83–98%) and O157 (34–63%). Another fimbrial operon locus (ECSE_3375–3378) is similar to CS1 fimbriae that are a major colonization factor of some ETEC strains.54 The CS1-like fimbrial operon in SE11 is also conserved in E24377A, HS, ATCC 8739, UPEC strain 536 and SMS-3-5 with the sequence similarity of 71–100% amino acid sequence identities. Of the fimbrial operons conserved between SE11 and MG1655, only three genes (ECSE_2643–2645) in the yfc operon showed low similarities of 52–59% amino acid sequence identities between them, while the three genes showed 98–99% amino acid sequence identities with those of Shigella flexneri.Genes for fimbriae in SE11a‘+’ indicates a locus where all genes are present; ‘−’ indicates a locus where all genes are absent; and ‘(+)’ indicates a locus where one or more genes, but not all, are absent or disrupted.Genes for fimbriae in SE11a‘+’ indicates a locus where all genes are present; ‘−’ indicates a locus where all genes are absent; and ‘(+)’ indicates a locus where one or more genes, but not all, are absent or disrupted.Several autotransporters such as E. coli AIDA-I and Ag43 are also known to have the function as fimbrial adhesions.55 Autotransporters are a large and diverse superfamily of proteins that are composed of an N-terminal variable passenger domain translocated across the membrane and a C-terminal beta domain. SE11 possesses at least eight genes encoding intact autotransporters (Table 4), of which five autotransporters (ECSE_1215, ECSE_1251, ECSE_1600, ECSE_2459 and ECSE_2494) contained the pertactin motif (Pfam PF03212) and thus may function as adhesins like pertactins of Bordetella.56 Other sequenced E. coli strains also possess these homologous genes in various combinations but encode many of them as pseudogenes or completely lacked (Table 4). For instance, MG1655 has six orthologous genes of the eight autotransporter genes encoded in SE11, but three of the six genes were fragmented and seemed to no longer function. O157 Sakai and three UPEC strains (CTF073, UTI89 and 536) possess only four autotransporter genes homologous to four intact genes (ECSE_0327, ECSE_0393, ECSE_2494 and ECSE_3884) in SE11. Absence of orthologs of three genes (ECSE_1215, ECSE_1251 and ECSE_1600) is common in the three strains (CTF073, UTI89 and 536) belonging to phylogenetic group B2, suggesting that these orthologous genes may have been lost only in the lineage to the B2 group after divergence of the ancestor of the B2 group from the common ancestral E. coli (see Supplementary Fig. S1). Relative abundance of autotransporter homologs was observed in ETEC E24377A and a commensal HS belonging to groups B1 and A, respectively, both of which possess six intact autotransporter genes. The orthologs of ECSE_3884 are widely conserved and distributed throughout E. coli and Shigella, and its passenger domain contains the short repeats (PF05658) and motifs (PF05662) found in hemagglutinins, suggesting that the autotransporter encoded by ECSE_3884 may also be involved in the mechanism of bacterial attachment to host cells.57 It is also noteworthy that SE11 contained no autotransporter that exports host-damaging proteins with the serine protease activity such as Sat and Pic produced by UPEC strains.58,59Genes for autotransporter in SE11a‘+’ indicates presence; ‘−’ indicates absence; and ‘(+)’ indicates presence of a truncated gene.Genes for autotransporter in SE11a‘+’ indicates presence; ‘−’ indicates absence; and ‘(+)’ indicates presence of a truncated gene.4. DiscussionFrom the detailed analysis of the genome sequence of the wild-type commensal strain SE11, we found that SE11 is notably abundant in the adhesion functions such as fimbriae and autotransporters that have been originally identified as virulence-associated functions in pathogenic E. coli strains.60,61 Although many of these adhesion-associated genes are also conserved in pathogenic E. coli strains, our data indicated that SE11 does not accompany other known virulence-associated genes found in the pathogenic strains. Furthermore, many of these adhesion-associated genes were encoded in the integrated regions on the chromosome and in the transmittable plasmids in SE11, indicating that they have been horizontally acquired in SE11. Lack of known virulence-associated genes in SE11 was also evident from the structural comparisons of several conserved prophages in SE11, MG1655 and O157 Sakai, showing that virulence-associated genes present in the prophages of O157 were completely missing in those of SE11 and MG1655, while other genes were retained. The SE11 plasmids also encoded many genes associated with bacterial conjugation. This feature may be advantageous for the efficient distribution of plasmids through cell–cell contacts in the gut environment with the high microbial density.5 These data suggest that the adhesion-associated genes are transferable genetic elements between E. coli and rather serve as a versatile function enhancing the ability of E. coli to colonize the gut. This notion is consistent with the recent finding that commensal and pathogenic E. coli strains use a common pilus adherence factor for the colonization.62The comparison of SE11 with the laboratory-adapted strain MG1655 revealed that SE11 possessed more genes involved in the metabolism of carbohydrates as well as the genes for the adhesion than MG1655. These genes are associated with uptake of available nutrients, allowing E. coli to survive in the intestinal tract rich in oligo- and polysaccharides.63 The genomic features of SE11 shown here may indicate the consequence of adaptation of the commensal E. coli strain to human gut habitat.Supplementary DataSupplementary data are available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.FundingThis research was supported by Grants-in-Aid for Scientific Research on Priority Areas ‘Comprehensive Genomics’ (M.H.) and ‘Applied Genomics’ (T.H.) from the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science, and Technology of Japan.We thank K.

IntroductionIdentification of genes on genomic sequences is the indispensable first step in every genome analysis, including individual genome analysis of a single organism and metagenomic analyses. Sequence similarity-based methods of gene predictions enable us to detect reliably the genes if their DNA or amino acid sequences have strong similarities to those of known genes. However, a significant portion of genes has no sequence similarities to known genes, and ab initio gene-finding methods are necessary for identifying all genes on newly sequenced microbial genomes, particularly those of uncharacterized or poorly characterized species. Computational gene finding from genomic sequences has a long history1–3, and a number of tools have been developed for predicting prokaryotic genes. These gene-finding tools have been widely used for annotation processes of prokaryotic genomes.Although conventional gene-finding tools have achieved extremely high prediction performances, they have some critical limitations. Most conventional tools require predetermined statistical models of the known genes of a target species4–11 or a long enough input sequence for statistical models to perform self-training12–16. This is because the tools are designed to predict genes on complete genomes having several million base pairs. However, a target genomic sequence is not always long enough. For example, second-generation DNA sequencers, which have put high throughput sequencing into practice, especially those of microbial genomes17,18, produce vast amounts of very short sequence reads. The short reads are assembled into some longer contig sequences, but the contigs are usually still short [far shorter than 1 mega bases (Mb)]19–22. A fosmid clone, which has ∼40 kb in insert length, is another example of a short genomic sequence. Moreover, metagenomic analyses produce large amounts of short sequences derived from multiple species’ genomes. Most of the conventional gene-finding tools cannot be applied to such sequences. MetaGene23 (MG) is one of the new tools that is applicable to gene prediction on such short anonymous sequences.MG is a gene-finding program originally developed for metagenomic sequence data, which is a mixture of (short) sequences derived from various prokaryotic genomes. MG assumes correlations between the GC content and the di-codon frequencies of an input sequence, and enables us to predict genes accurately on short anonymous sequences without any training. MG can be successfully applied to wide varieties of prokaryotic genomic sequences24–27, but two major limitations exist: one is the lack of a ribosomal binding site (RBS) model, and the other is less sensitivity to atypical genes, whose codon usages are different from those of typical genes. When MG is applied to very short sequences containing one or two partial genes, these limitations are not significant. However, such limitations are undesirable when MG is applied to longer genomic sequences for precise annotations. To overcome these limitations and to improve the usability of the program, we developed a new version of the MG, the MetaGeneAnnotator (MGA). The MGA has statistical models of prophage genes and can automatically detect them in addition to chromosome backbone genes even when input genomic sequences have mosaic structures attributed to lateral gene transfers and/or phage infections. The MGA also has an adaptable the RBS model based on complementary sequences of the 3′ tail of 16S ribosomal RNA, and precisely predicts translation starts of genes even when input genomic sequences are short and anonymous sequences. These features of the MGA remarkably improve prediction accuracies of genes on a wide range of prokaryotic genomes. Here, we report the results of a performance test of the MGA applied to various types of genomic sequences, such as complete genomes, plasmids and their subsequences of various lengths, under conditions of anonymity.2. Materials and methods2.1. Construction of prophage gene modelIn addition to the bacterial and archaeal gene models of MG23, prophage models were constructed as follows. Genomic sequences and their annotations for 439 phages were obtained from the RefSeq database28 (release 27). As a preprocessing, a mono-codon usage was calculated from each phage genome, and the Euclidean distances of all pairs of the codon usages were calculated. When the distance between two phages’ usages was <0.02, one of them was removed from the dataset because they might have been related (or identical) phages. Then, the codon frequencies of the remaining 244 phages were plotted against their GC contents, and we confirmed that the codon frequencies of phage were highly correlated with their GC contents, as seen in bacterial and archaeal genomes. For gene prediction, the MGA used di-codon frequencies that represent conditional probabilities of codon occurrences providing a previous codon (61 × 61 frequencies). Because each phage did not have enough genes to calculate di-codon frequencies, phage genomes having about the same range of GC contents were treated as a unit, and then di-codon frequencies were calculated from all genes annotated in the grouped genomes. Finally, a logistic regression analysis was performed in the same manner as the prokaryotic di-codon model construction in MG.2.2. Procedures for predicting typical and atypical genesAfter training, four sets (self, bacteria, archaea and prophage) of di-codon frequencies are applied for scoring candidate genes. Unlike the original MG algorithm, each open-reading frame (ORF) is individually scored according to its own GC content in this step to detect atypical genes. Typical genes are expected to score the highest mark with the self-training model, and atypical genes to score the highest mark with one of the other models. Then, a maximal scoring combination of genes is calculated as the definitive prediction. While this procedure (ORF-by-ORF) is sensitive to atypical genes, some more false-positives are included in the prediction. So, the ORF-by-ORF procedure is applied only to the sequences longer than 5000 bp (containing multiple genes). For shorter sequences, the conventional procedure, in which all ORFs are scored by one of the four sets of the di-codon models according to the GC content of the input sequence, is applied.2.3. The RBS map analysis and the RBS model constructionWe defined nine hexamers derived from the following sequence, which was complementary to a tail of 16S rRNA, as the potential RBS motifs: G(A/T)(A/T)AGGAGGT(G/A)ATC. Starting from the left, the motifs were named Motif-1, …, Motif-9 [e.g. Motif-3 is ‘(A/T)AGGAG’]. An exact match or one-base mismatch sequence of the motifs was sought against an upstream region of a start codon, and the best match motif and location were determined. In the RBS map analysis (see below), upstream sequences of the annotated start codons range from −2 to −21 were used for analysis. In the RBS prediction model, upstream sequences of the predicted start codons (in the previous step) range from −3 to −19 were used for model construction and prediction. The detected sequences were considered to be representative RBSs of the species, and the proportion of genes having representative RBSs (an RBS ratio, wRBS) was stored for the use in scoring RBSs. Then, a two-dimensional frequency distribution of the representative RBSs was calculated to construct the RBS map. For the analysis, distances between the constructed RBS maps were defined by the Euclidean distance, and the neighbor joining method29 was applied to make clusters of the RBS maps. This RBS map analysis was performed using 591 annotated microbial genomes obtained from the RefSeq database (Supplementary Table S1). As the RBS prediction model, a position weight matrix (PWM) for each motif was constructed using the representative RBS sequences detected earlier. In the prediction process, the RBS scores for all candidate genes were calculated using the constructed PWMs and the frequency distributions of the positions. Here, the RBS score, SRBS, was heuristically weighted using a frequency of a motif m, wm, and the RBS ratio (wRBS) to reduce noise in less frequently used motifs.2.4. Performance evaluationPrediction performances of gene-finders were evaluated using datasets, including the MetaGene dataset23. The MetaGene dataset consists of nine bacterial and three archaeal genomic sequences (Supplementary Table S2). In addition to these complete sequences, their subsequences (1 Mb, 500, 100, 40, 10, 5, 3 and 1 kb, 700 and 100 bp sequences) having 1× genome coverage (i.e. the total length of the subsequences is equal to the complete genome size) were also used for the evaluation. These sequences were not used for constructing statistical models of the MGA. The ratios of true-positives, including partially matching predictions with correct reading frames, relative to all annotated genes (sensitivity) and to all predicted genes (specificity) were used as indices for the evaluation. In addition, sensitivity to the start codons, in which only exactly matching predictions were counted as true-positives, was also utilized.3. Results and discussion3.1. Predicting prophage genesThe MGA is based on the algorithm of the MG and utilizes logistic regression models of the GC content and the di-codon frequencies23 (di-codon models). In addition to the bacterial and archaeal di-codon models of MG, prophage models are constructed and integrated into the MGA (Fig. 1A). Although the proportions of prophage genes in the prokaryotic genomes are ordinarily not so large, they usually have biologically important functions, such as pathogenicity and niche adaptation, in the organisms. Therefore, detecting prophage genes is fundamental to understanding the genetic background of an organism.A schematic diagram of the MGA algorithm. (A) Prediction protocol of the MGA. (B) ORF-by-ORF procedure.A schematic diagram of the MGA algorithm. (A) Prediction protocol of the MGA. (B) ORF-by-ORF procedure.Because most prophage genes have codon frequencies similar to those of bacteria and archaea, MG (and probably other prokaryotic gene finders as well) can predict prophage genes with relatively high accuracies (Supplementary Table S3). However, Fig. 2A and B shows that certain other (non-codon) properties of prophage genes are different from those of prokaryotic genes: prophage genes are generally shorter (∼660 bp in average) than bacterial and archaeal genes (∼940 bp in average), and most genes are organized in tandem (>90%). This means that gene densities are higher in prophage genomes than in prokaryotic genomes, and most genes are packed in a few operons. These observations and statistics, in addition to the prophage di-codon models, are utilized to predict prophage genes. As a result, the sensitivities of the MGA to prophage genes are remarkably improved (from 88 to 93%) without any decrease in specificity (90%) (Supplementary Table S3).Statistics of prophage genes.

Predicting atypical genesMG predicts genes using the di-codon frequencies (and other parameters) estimated by the GC content of an input genomic sequence. That is to say, all genes in the same genomic sequence are predicted by the same set of di-codon frequencies. In this procedure, typical genes can be accurately and specifically predicted, but atypical genes, such as horizontally transferred and prophage genes, cannot be detected because their di-codon frequencies are different from those of typical genes. To overcome this limitation, we employ an ORF-by-ORF procedure, in which each candidate ORF is treated as an individual anonymous sequence (Fig. 1B). This procedure assumes that every ORF has a potentially different origin and contributes to improving the sensitivities of the MGA to atypical genes.To predict properly the typical genes under the ORF-by-ORF procedure, we arranged a self-training model of di-codon frequencies in addition to the logistic regression models (Fig. 1A). In the self-training model, di-codon frequencies are calculated from the initially predicted genes using the conventional scoring procedure of the MG, and then the weighted averages of di-codon frequencies derived from the predicted genes and from the regression models are calculated as the di-codon frequencies of typical genes. The self-training model fits well to typical genes compared with the regression models, and improves both sensitivity and specificity of the MGA to typical genes.To evaluate the effectiveness of these procedures, prediction performances were tested on the chromosome and plasmid of enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O157:H7 strain Sakai30,31 (Supplementary Table S4). Sensitivities of the MGA are extremely higher than those of the MG, especially in S-loops, which are O157:H7 strain-specific regions identified from comparisons with the E. coli K12 genome and that contain many horizontally acquired virulence-related genes. Higher sensitivities are also observed for a large virulence plasmid (pO157). Specificities of the MGA are slightly lower than those of MG, but are still higher than those of GeneMarkS16 and GeneMark.heuristics32. These results indicate that our ORF-by-ORF procedure works well for predicting atypical genes and can be applied to genomes having mosaic structures with high specificity.3.3. Analyzing species-specific patterns of the RBSThe other notable feature of the MGA is an adaptable model of the RBS. An RBS, which is also known as the Shine-Dalgarno (SD) sequence33, is located on the 5′ flanking region of the start codon, and interacts with a part of the 3′ end of 16S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) to control translation initiations of the gene. Although RBSs are complementary to the 3′ tail of the 16S rRNA in every organism, their sequences (motifs) and preferred locations relative to start codons (or ‘spacer’ lengths) differ slightly from organism to organism. In gene-finding programs, the Gibbs sampling algorithm is widely used for training the motifs and the spacer length distribution of the target species’ RBSs16,17, although this algorithm takes no thought for the observation that the RBSs are complementary to the tail of the 16S rRNA. This approach basically assumes one motif and one frequency distribution of the spacer lengths in each species. However, our analysis suggests that this assumption is not appropriate for most species.We examined the upstream sequences of annotated genes from 229 prokaryotic genomes and constructed RBS maps that show a two-dimensional frequency distribution of the best match motif (out of the nine candidate motifs we suggested) and the spacer lengths of the RBSs for each species. The average RBS map (Fig. 3) shows that Motif-3 is most frequently used, but all nine motifs are potential RBSs. The higher the motif number, the shorter the spacer lengths. This is reasonable because it means that the position of the main body of the 16S rRNA is fixed even if the hybridization position of 16S rRNA tail is moved.The average RBS map. The horizontal axis represents relative positions from the start codons [equal to –(spacer length+1)], and the vertical axis represents motif numbers.The average RBS map. The horizontal axis represents relative positions from the start codons [equal to –(spacer length+1)], and the vertical axis represents motif numbers.The observed patterns of the RBS maps vary from organism to organism, while phylogenetically related species show similar patterns (Figs 4 and 5). Although some species such as Helicobacter pylori (Fig. 5A) and Buchnera aphidicola, predominantly use Motif-2 and -3 and are therefore congruous with the one motif assumption described earlier many other species show broader distributions. For example, some Firmicutes, including Clostridium (Fig. 5B), and Thermotogae indicate broad and clear patterns of the RBS maps. Some archaea, including methanogens (Fig. 5C), also indicate broad patterns, but the preferred motifs are different between these bacteria and archaea (e.g. Clostridium acetobutylicum prefers Motif-3 and -4, but Methanobrevibacter smithii prefers Motif-8.). Overall, bacterial species tend to prefer motifs of 3′ side of a tail of 16S rRNA, while archaeal ones tend to prefer motifs of 5′ side of the tail. Only very weak signals of the RBS motifs are found in some species belonging to Bacteroidetes and Cyanobacteria (Fig. 5D). In these species, no other significant motif is found. These results suggest that our RBS map with nine fixed motifs is effective for capturing the species-specific pattern of the RBSs. Hence, we used this two-dimensional frequency distribution and the PWMs of the nine RBS motifs as an RBS model of the MGA. Parameters of the RBS model are estimated from upstream sequences of predicted genes. To predict the RBSs on very short input sequences (having no training data), a general model of the RBS was manually constructed, based on the average RBS map and was integrated into the MGA (Fig. 1A).The clustering result of the RBS maps derived from 229 of 591 prokaryotic genomes (one species per genus).The clustering result of the RBS maps derived from 229 of 591 prokaryotic genomes (one species per genus).The RBS maps for four species.

Prediction performances on long genomic sequencesThe prediction performances of the MGA and conventional gene-finding tools based on unsupervised learning, such as GeneMarkS16 and Glimmer317, were evaluated on various datasets. Fig. 6A shows the prediction accuracies on the MetaGene dataset, which consists of nine bacterial and three archaeal genomic sequences (Supplementary Table S2) and their subsequences having 1× genome coverage (i.e. the total length of the subsequences is equal to the complete genome size).Prediction performances of gene finders on the MetaGene dataset.

(C) Relationship between accuracies and number of 40 kb-sequences in the MGA-s prediction. Sn, exact and Sp indicate sensitivity, sensitivity to start codons and specificity, respectively.For complete genomes and 1 Mb subsequences, all prediction tools indicate almost identical sensitivities (∼97%), while specificity is significantly higher in the MGA (93%) compared with the others (90% in GeneMarkS and 86–87% in Glimmer3). In other words, the sensitivities of the MGA are potentially higher than the others at the same specificity level. Sensitivities to start codons are also identical in the MGA (78%) and GeneMarkS (77%), but Glimmer3 shows lower values (72–75%), although both GeneMarkS and Glimmer3 utilize the Gibbs sampling procedure to train their RBS models. In contrast, the mean sensitivity to start codons in Glimmer3 is better than that in GeneMarkS on the other dataset (Table 1), which consists of six complete genomes (one archaea and five bacteria) having relatively broad distributions of the RBS maps. The performance of the MGA is stable and exceeds the others also in this dataset, especially in Clostridium acetobutylicum. In comparison with the original MG (Fig. 6B), the MGA remarkably improves sensitivities to both genes and start codons without reducing specificities. These results indicate that our simple RBS model works well for detecting various types of the RBS.Prediction performances on the complete genomesRBS%, the RBS ratio (the proportion of genes having representative RBSs); Sn, sensitivity to genes; (exact), sensitivity to start codons; Sp, specificity.Prediction performances on the complete genomesRBS%, the RBS ratio (the proportion of genes having representative RBSs); Sn, sensitivity to genes; (exact), sensitivity to start codons; Sp, specificity.3.5. Prediction performances on short genomic sequencesFor sequences shorter than 1 Mb, the MGA retained high accuracies in every index (Fig. 6A). Both sensitivities and specificities of Glimmer3 are relatively high when input sequences are longer than 40 kb, but the performance of the start codon prediction is rapidly degraded as the input sequences become shorter. This is because the Gibbs sampling algorithm requires a significant number of positive (RBS) sequences to detect the correct motif. A 40 kb-sequence has <40 genes (or RBSs) on average, and the sensitivity to start codons declines to 57% in Glimmer3. GeneMarkS does not accept a shorter input sequence than 1 Mb, probably because it has the same weak point as Glimmer3. Unlike the RBS models of these tools, the MGA assumes only nine hexamers as candidate's RBSs, and relatively few sequences are needed to estimate the parameters of the RBS model. As a result, the MGA requires just 500 kb (or ∼500 genes) to adapt the RBS model fully to the input sequence, and its sensitivity to start codons is sufficiently high (75%) even in 40 kb sequences. Furthermore, Fig. 6B and Table 2 show that the general RBS model of the MGA also works well for predicting the start codons of genes on very short sequences. Although most genes on 700 bp-subsequences lack their 5′ sequences (including start codon and RBSs), the results also indicate that the RBS model contributes to improving prediction specificities by deselecting false-positive translation starts.Prediction performances on 700 bp subsequences (1× genome coverage)RBS%, the RBS ratio (the proportion of genes having representative RBSs); Sn, sensitivity to genes; (exact), sensitivity to start codons; Sp, specificity; MGA-s, MGA with –s option in which multiple sequences are treated as a unit.Prediction performances on 700 bp subsequences (1× genome coverage)RBS%, the RBS ratio (the proportion of genes having representative RBSs); Sn, sensitivity to genes; (exact), sensitivity to start codons; Sp, specificity; MGA-s, MGA with –s option in which multiple sequences are treated as a unit.3.6. Advantage of self-training using a set of genomic sequencesIf multiple (short) input sequences can be assumed as the genomic sequences of the same species, prediction accuracies on the sequences are improved by self-training of the models as well as on a long-genomic sequence (the MGA-s in Fig. 6B and C). Fig. 6C shows the relationships between prediction accuracies and the number of 40 kb-sequences treated as a unit. Fig. 6C also suggests that a total of about 500 kb (10–20×40 kb) are needed for full adaptation of the RBS model, but the prediction accuracies steadily improve if the number of input sequences are increased. When a sufficient amount of sequences are available, the MGA provides prediction performances comparable to the complete genome analyses, even if each sequence is very short (Table 2). So, if multiple contig sequences are obtained by sequencing a single species’ genome, or if metagenomic sequences are phylogenetically classified into groups using some classification methods34,35, genes on the sequences can be more precisely predicted by the MGA.3.7. ConclusionAs mentioned, the MGA successfully overcomes the limitations of the MG, and archives high prediction accuracies especially in the start codon predictions. Although some gene-finding tools advocating high sensitivity to start codons, such as GeneMarkS and Glimmer3 tend to sacrifice specificities for improving sensitivities, the RBS model of the MGA enables the sensitive detection of start codons without reducing specificities. Our RBS model is based on previous knowledge about the RBS and 16S rRNA, and requires little training data for estimating its parameters. As a result, the MGA can precisely predict genes even on short genomic sequences unlike the other tools. Both typical and atypical genes can be sensitively and precisely detected while keeping high specificity. The MGA can detect not only chromosome backbone genes but also prophage genes and provides a complete set of genes on a genomic sequence. The MGA also provides information about the selected di-codon model (bacteria, archaea, prophage or self) for predicting each gene, and the information is helpful for further analyses of genes because it reflects statistical differences among the genes.In addition to the precise prediction ability of the MGA, the RBS map analysis proposed here is helpful for genome annotations and is useful for analyzing translation initiation mechanisms and their evolutions. It is important for annotators to comprehend a specific RBS pattern of a target species and its related species. The MGA can automatically extract the pattern, and outputs information on RBSs in addition to location information on genes. We believe that the MGA accelerates not only metagenomic analyses but also the annotation processes of all kinds of prokaryotic and phage genomes.AvailabilityMetaGeneAnnotator are freely available at http://metagene.cb.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp.Supplementary DataSupplementary Data is available online at www.dnaresearch.oxfordjournals.org.The original MetaGene was developed at Toshihisa Takagi laboratory (University of Tokyo).
