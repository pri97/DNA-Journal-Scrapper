The 376 ESTs resulted in 123 redundant groups, thus the total number of unique sequences in the EST set was 717. Database search by BLAST algorithm showed that 302 of the unique sequences shared significant similarities to known nucleotide or amino acid sequences. Six unique sequences showed significant similarities to genes that are involved in flower development and sexual reproduction, such as cynarase, fimbriata -associated protein and S-receptor kinase genes. The remaining unique 415 sequences have no significant similarity with any database-registered genes or proteins. The redundant 123 ESTs implied the presence of gene families and abundant transcripts of unknown identity. Analyses of the coding sequences of 61 unique sequences, which contained no ambiguous bases in the predicted coding regions, highly homologous to known sequences at the amino acid level with a similarity score greater than 400, and with stop codons at similar positions as their possible orthologues, indicated the presence of biased codon usage and higher GC content within the coding sequences (50.4%) than that within 3′ flanking sequences (41.9%).

The corresponding single copy gene consists of 10 exons which encode a protein that possesses all the characteristics of subtilisin-like proteases. The promoter of the AIR3 gene was fused to the gusA (β-glucuronidase) reporter gene and introduced into Arabidopsis . Expression was almost completely restricted to the outer layers of the parental root at sites of lateral root emergence and could be observed even before protrusion of the newly formed root tip. In the presence of external auxin, GUS activity was visible throughout the parts of the root that are competent for lateral root formation. By digesting structural proteins in the extracellular matrix of cells located above sites of lateral root formation, AIR3 might weaken cell-to-cell connections and thus facilitate lateral root emergence.

The coding sequence resides on exons 3, 4, 5, 6 and 7. Sequencing of cDNA clones isolated from human hippocampus library revealed that the second exon was often skipped by an alternative splicing event. All introns commenced with nucleotides GT at the 5′ boundary and ended with nucleotides AG at the 3′ boundary, in agreement with the proposed consensus sequence for intron spliced donor and acceptance sites. Sequence inspection of the 5′-flanking region revealed the absence of a ‘TATA’ box and the presence of putative cis -acting regulatory elements such as Sp1, GATA-1, CCAAT, and c-Myb. Moreover, the sequence analysis of Elk2 locus on 14q32.3 confirmed that Elk2 gene corresponds to a processed pseudogene of Elk1 which has been reported between alpha 1 gene ( IGHA1 ) and pseudo gamma gene ( IGHGP ) of immunoglobulin heavy chain. Furthermore, the results of Southern analysis using DNAs from human-mouse hybrid cell lines carrying a part of 14q32 region revealed that there is another locus hybridizing to Elk1 cDNA on 14q32.2 → qter region in addition to Elk2 locus between IGHA1 and IGHGP loci.

Thus ppx encodes an enzyme that has exopoly(P)ase activity. "," In Pseudomonas aeriginosa , a gene, ppx , that encodes exopolyphosphatase [exopoly(P)ase; EC 3.6.1.11] of 506 amino acids (56,419 Da) was found downstream of the gene for polyphosphate kinase, ppk . Since ppx is located in the opposite direction of the ppk gene, they do not constitute an operon. The predicted amino acid sequence of PPX is 41% identical with Escherichia coli PPX. The gene product of ppx (paPPX) was overproduced in E. coli , and its activity was evaluated. Orthophosphate (P i ) is released from polyphosphate [poly(P)], the average chain lengths of which are 79 and 750, respectively. The amount of P i released matched the amount of poly(P) lost. Thus ppx encodes an enzyme that has exopoly(P)ase activity. "

None of the deduced products of the novel genes exhibited significant homology to previously known proteins. We also identified ten microsatellites and 12 different VNTR sequences within the target region. HGC6.3 contained a VNTR within a coding exon, each repeat consisting of 42 nucleotides; the predicted 14-amino-acid consensus unit is MTPTVFSSQHTAGG.

To investigate the mechanism of transcriptional regulation of the p73 gene, we isolated a genomic DNA fragment spanning the 5′ upstream region of the human p73 gene and characterized the promoter region. Unlike the p53 gene promoter, the human p73 gene promoter contained a putative TATA box, and did not exhibit any extended homology to the p53 gene. Two CpG islands were located in the 5′ upstream region. Transient transfection assays using progressive truncations of the p73 promoter showed that deletion from −119 to +19 relative to exon 1 resulted in a 13- to 20-foldred uction in the p73 promoter activity, suggesting that the elements for basal promoter activity exist in this region, where putative Sp1, AP-2 and Egr-1, 2, 3 sites are located and CpG dinucleotides are especially concentrated."
