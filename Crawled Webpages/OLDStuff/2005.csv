However, data from microarray experiments are well known to contain biases resulting from the experimental protocols. Therefore, in order to elucidate biological knowledge from the data, systematic biases arising from their protocols must be removed prior to any data analysis. To remove these biases, many normalization methods are used by researchers. However, not all biases are eliminated from the microarray data because not all types of errors from experimental protocols are known. In this paper, we report an effective way of removing various types of biases by treating each microarray dataset independently to detect biases present in the dataset. After the biases contained in each dataset were identified, a combination of normalization methods specifically made for each dataset was applied to remove biases one at a time.","Microarrays are often used to identify target genes that trigger specific diseases, to elucidate the mechanisms of drug effects, and to check SNPs.

"2","10.1093/dnares/12.1.9","The WRKY Family of Transcription Factors in Rice and Arabidopsis and Their Origins","Kun-Lu Wu,Ze-Jian Guo,Hai-Hua Wang,Jing Li","NO","NO","NO","01 February 2005","evolution, Oryza sativa, transcription factor, WRKY gene "," WRKY transcription factors, originally isolated from plants contain one or two conserved WRKY domains, about 60 amino acid residues with the WRKYGQK sequence followed by a C2H2 or C2HC zinc finger motif. Evidence is accumulating to suggest that the WRKY proteins play significant roles in responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, and in development. In this research, we identified 102 putative WRKY genes from the rice genome and compared them with those from Arabidopsis . The WRKY genes from rice and Arabidopsis were divided into three groups with several subgroups on the basis of phylogenies and the basic structure of the WRKY domains (WDs). The phylogenetic trees generated from the WDs and the genes indicate that the WRKY gene family arose during evolution through duplication and that the dramatic amplification of rice WRKY genes in group III is due to tandem and segmental gene duplication compared with those of Arabidopsis. The result suggests that some of the rice WRKY genes in group III are evolutionarily more active than those in Arabidopsis , and may have specific roles in monocotyledonous plants. Further, it was possible to identify the presence of WRKY -like genes in protists ( Giardia lamblia and Dictyostelium discoideum ) and green algae Chlamydomonas reinhardtii through database research, demonstrating the ancient origin of the gene family. The results obtained by alignments of the WDs from different species and other analysis imply that domain gain and loss is a divergent force for expansion of the WRKY gene family, and that a rapid amplification of the WRKY genes predate the divergence of monocots and dicots. On the basis of these results, we believe that genes encoding a single WD may have been derived from the C-terminal WD of the genes harboring two WDs. The conserved intron splicing positions in the WDs of higher plants offer clues about WRKY gene evolution, annotation, and classification.

Over 3,500 components involved in several aspects of signal transduction, transcription, development, cell cycle, stress responses and pathogen interaction were compiled into the Sugarcane Signal Transduction (SUCAST) Catalogue. Sequence comparisons and protein domain analysis revealed 477 receptors, 510 protein kinases, 107 protein phosphatases, 75 small GTPases, 17 G-proteins, 114 calcium and inositol metabolism proteins, and over 600 transcription factors. The elements were distributed into 29 main categories subdivided into 409 sub-categories. Genes with no matches in the public databases and of unknown function were also catalogued. A cDNA microarray was constructed to profile individual variation of plants cultivated in the field and transcript abundance in six plant organs (flowers, roots, leaves, lateral buds, and 1 st and 4 th internodes). From 1280 distinct elements analyzed, 217 (17%) presented differential expression in two biological samples of at least one of the tissues tested. A total of 153 genes (12%) presented highly similar expression levels in all tissues. A virtual profile matrix was constructed and the expression profiles were validated by real-time PCR. The expression data presented can aid in assigning function for the sugarcane genes and be useful for promoter characterization of this and other economically important grasses.

We also identified three types (A, B, C) of Itpa transcripts in mouse tissues. The processed Itpa gene-like sequence located on chromosome 2E1 has a complete open reading frame for exactly the same polypeptide as ITPA encoded by the type A transcript, with a polyadenylation signal. However, no transcribed sequence derived from the Itpa gene-like sequence was detectable in any of the mouse tissues examined, thus naming the sequence as Itpa processed pseudogene a The type A Itpa mRNA, which was expressed in all mouse tissues examined, only encodes mouse ITPA polypeptide consisting of 198 amino acid residues with a capacity to hydrolyze dITP into dIMP. Itpa mRNA was detected in all tissues examined, and its expression is especially high in the testis, brain, and thymus. ITPA protein was mostly detected in the cytoplasm, to a lesser extent in the nuclei of neurons in the brain, and also those of hepatocytes, epithelial cells lining the bile duct, and endothelial cells lining the portal vein in the liver.

Their expression is strictly controlled by P tac / lacIq . The plasmids carrying each ORF were introduced into an F +recA strain and stored in 96-well microtiter plates. In this way, 96 clones can be transferred simultaneously to F - bacteria using the conjugative system. This provides a convenient procedure for systematic identification of ORFs that suppress or complement mutations. We created two types of clone sets: the original set contained individual clones in 45 microtiter plates, and a second set contained pools of 48 clones stored in a single microtiter plate. Using these clone sets, we have identified 403 genes that can correct in trans the temperature-sensitive defect of cell division mutants, which would suggest multiple global regulators for bacterial cell division.

L. burttii is a relatively small and early flowering plant with non-shattering behavior. The general chromosome morphology is very similar to Gifu, and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis revealed that the short arm of chromosome 1 in L. burttii is comparable to that of Gifu, indicating that the translocation event involving chromosomes 1 and 2, which was observed in L. japonicus Miyakojima MG-20, is not present in L. burttii . In addition L. burttii has a higher level of DNA polymorphism compared to Gifu and MG-20 enabling design of codominant markers such as SSR, CAPS and dCAPS.
