We report here a new promoter trapping system for use with mammalian cells comprised of the following three steps: 1) Cloning of DNA fragments into a promoter-trapping vector, 2) integration of the trapping vector into a designated target in the mammalian genome using the Cre site-specific recombinase, and 3) screening of integrants for trapped promoter sequences by activation of the luciferase gene. To assess the efficiency of this system, lox trapping vectors containing sense tk promoter, antisense tk promoter, or a non-promoter sequence of the neo gene were employed. The resulting levels of luciferase activity of the site-specific integrants were measured directly. Luciferase activity of the integrants can be assayed under conventional culture conditions by simply replacing the culture medium with potassium phosphate buffer containing luciferin. Only those G418 r colonies carrying the tk promoter in the normal orientation exhibited a 21- to 35-fold increase in luciferase activity over that of the other integrants. These results indicate that this system is an effective means of trapping promoter sequences from random mammalian genomic DNA fragments. "

The total length of the genome finally confirmed was 3,573,470 bp, including the previously reported sequence of 1,003,450 bp from map position 64% to 92% of the genome. The entire sequence was assembled from the sequences of the physical map-based contigs of cosmid clones and of <U+03BB> clones and long PCR products which were used for gap-filling. The accuracy of the sequence was guaranteed by analysis of both strands of DNA through the entire genome.

The first ORF of 100 codons potentially encodes a polypeptide having 47% amino acid identity to Escherichia coli ribosomal protein S14, suggesting it as a ribosomal protein S14 gene ( rps14 ).
